'''Tajikistan''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Tajikistan.ogg|t|ɑː|ˈ|dʒ|iː|k|ɪ|s|t|ɑː|n}}, {{IPAc-en|t|ə|-|,_|t|æ|-}}; {{lang-tg|Тоҷикистон}} {{IPA-fa|tɔdʒikisˈtɔn|}}), officially the '''Republic of Tajikistan''' ({{lang-tg|Ҷумҳурии Тоҷикистон}}, Jumhuriyi Tojikiston), is a mountainous, [[landlocked]] country in [[Central Asia]] with an area of {{convert|143100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and an estimated population of {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN Population|Tajikistan}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people as of {{UN Population|Year}}. It is bordered by [[Afghanistan]] to the south,  [[Uzbekistan]] to the west,  [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the north, and  [[China]] to the east. The traditional homelands of the [[Tajiks|Tajik people]] include present-day Tajikistan as well as parts of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan.

The territory that now constitutes Tajikistan was previously home to several ancient cultures, including the city of [[Sarazm]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Proto-urban Site of Sarazm|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1141|website=UNESCO.org|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=9 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140804122836/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1141/|archivedate=4 August 2014}}</ref> of the [[Neolithic]] and the [[Bronze Age]], and was later home to kingdoms ruled by people of different faiths and cultures, including the [[Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex|Oxus civilisation]], [[Andronovo culture]], [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorian Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manichaeism]] and [[Islam]]. The area has been ruled by numerous empires and dynasties, including the [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Sasanian Empire]], [[Hephthalite Empire]], [[Samanid Empire]], [[Mongol Empire]], [[Timurid dynasty]], the [[Russian Empire]], and subsequently the [[Soviet Union]]. Within the Soviet Union, the country's modern borders were drawn when it was part of [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan]] as an [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|autonomous republic]] before becoming a [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|full-fledged Soviet republic]] in 1929.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On 9 September 1991, Tajikistan became an independent sovereign nation when the Soviet Union [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|disintegrated]]. A [[Civil war in Tajikistan|civil war]] was fought almost immediately after independence, lasting from 1992 to 1997. Since the end of the war, newly established political stability and foreign aid have allowed the country's economy to grow. Like all other Central Asian neighbouring states, the country, led by [[President of Tajikistan|President]] [[Emomali Rahmon]] since 1994, has been criticised by a number of [[non-governmental organization]]s for authoritarian leadership, lack of [[Freedom of religion in Tajikistan|religious freedom]], corruption and widespread [[Human rights in Tajikistan|violations of human rights]].

Tajikistan is a [[presidential republic]] consisting of four provinces. Most of Tajikistan's {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN Population|Tajikistan}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people belong to the [[Tajik people|Tajik]] ethnic group, who speak [[Tajik Language|Tajik]] (a dialect of [[Persian language|Persian]]). Many Tajiks also speak [[Russian language|Russian]] as their second language. While the state is constitutionally secular, [[Islam in Tajikistan|Islam]] is practiced by 98% of the population. In the [[Gorno-Badakhshan]] Oblast of Tajikistan, despite its sparse population, there is large linguistic diversity where [[Rushani dialect|Rushani]], [[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Ishkashimi language|Ishkashimi]], [[Wakhi Language|Wakhi]] and Tajik are some of the languages spoken. Mountains cover more than 90% of the country. It has a [[transition economy]] that is highly dependent on [[remittances]], [[aluminium]] and [[cotton]] production. Tajikistan is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]], [[Economic Cooperation Organization|ECO]], [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]] and [[Collective Security Treaty Organization|CSTO]] as well as an [[NATO]] [[Partnership for Peace|PfP partner]].

Tajikistan appeared as ''Tadjikistan'' or ''Tadzhikistan'' in English prior to 1991. This is due to a transliteration from the {{lang-ru|"Таджикистан"}}. In Russian, there is no single letter j to represent the phoneme /ʤ/, and therefore дж, or dzh, is used. Tadzhikistan is the most common alternate spelling and is widely used in English literature derived from Russian sources.<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-13/news/mn-615_1_armenian-refugees Anti-Armenian Riots Erupt in Soviet Republic of Tadzhikistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130184507/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-13/news/mn-615_1_armenian-refugees |date=30 November 2016 }}.

{{Main|History of Tajikistan}}

=== Early history ===
{{See also|Samanid Empire}}
Cultures in the region have been dated back to at least the 4th millennium BCE, including the [[Bronze Age]] [[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]], the [[Andronovo culture|Andronovo]] cultures and the [[Sarazm|pro-urban site of Sarazm]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage site]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1141|title=Proto-urban Site of Sarazm – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|date=|work=unesco.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304033948/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1141|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>

The earliest recorded history of the region dates back to about 500 BCE when much, if not all, of modern Tajikistan was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov" /> Some authors have also suggested that in the 7th and 6th century BCE parts of modern Tajikistan, including territories in the Zeravshan valley, formed part of [[Kambojas]] before it became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].<ref>See: The Deeds of Harsha: Being a Cultural Study of Bāṇa's Harshacharita, 1969, p 199, Dr Vasudeva Sharana Agrawala; Proceedings and Transactions of the All-India Oriental Conference, 1930, p 118, Dr J.

After the region's conquest by [[Alexander the Great]] it became part of the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]], a successor state of Alexander's empire. Northern Tajikistan (the cities of [[Khujand]] and [[Panjakent]]) was part of [[Sogdia]], a collection of city-states which was overrun by [[Scythians]] and [[Yuezhi]] nomadic tribes around 150 BCE. The [[Silk Road]] passed through the region and following the expedition of Chinese explorer [[Zhang Qian]] during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]] (141–87 BCE) commercial relations between [[Han Dynasty|Han China]] and Sogdiana flourished.<ref>[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18006 C.

The [[Kushan Empire]], a collection of [[Yuezhi]] tribes, took control of the region in the first century CE and ruled until the 4th century CE during which time [[Buddhism]], [[Nestorian Christianity]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and [[Manichaeism]] were all practised in the region.<ref name="Congress Call Number DK851?">[https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/cs/profiles/Tajikistan.pdf Tajikistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221014613/https://loc.gov/rr/frd/cs/profiles/Tajikistan.pdf |date=21 December 2016 }}. loc.gov.</ref> Later the [[Hephthalite Empire]], a collection of nomadic tribes, moved into the region and [[Arab]]s brought [[Islam]] in the early eighth century.<ref name="Congress Call Number DK851?" /> Central Asia continued in its role as a commercial crossroads, linking China, the steppes to the north, and the Islamic heartland.

It was temporarily under the control of the [[Tibetan empire]] and Chinese from 650–680 and then under the control of the Umayyads in 710. The [[Samanids|Samanid Empire]], 819 to 999, restored [[Persian people|Persian]] control of the region and enlarged the cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]] (both cities are today part of [[Uzbekistan]]) which became the cultural centres of [[Iran]] and the region was known as Khorasan. The [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] conquered [[Transoxania]] (which corresponds approximately with modern-day Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, southern Kyrgyzstan and southwest Kazakhstan) and ruled between 999–1211.<ref name=encyclo>{{cite web|url=http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9062103|title=Encyclopedia – Britannica Online Encyclopedia|work=eb.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Grousset, Rene |title=The Empire of the Steppes |publisher=Rutgers University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 }}</ref> Their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia,<ref name="svat">{{cite book |title=A history of Inner Asia |author=Svatopluk Soucek |chapter=Chapter 5 – The Qarakhanids |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-521-65704-4 }}</ref> but gradually the Kara-khanids became assimilated into the Perso-Arab Muslim culture of the region.<ref>[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ilak-khanids ilak-khanids] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909080737/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ilak-khanids |date=9 September 2015 }}: Iranica. accessed May 2014.</ref>

During [[Genghis Khan]]'s [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|invasion of Khwarezmia]] in the early 13th century the [[Mongol Empire]] took control over nearly all of Central Asia. In less than a century the [[Mongol Empire]] broke up and modern Tajikistan came under the rule of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. [[Tamerlane]] created the [[Timurid dynasty]] and took control of the region in the 14th century.

Modern Tajikistan fell under the rule of the [[Khanate of Bukhara]] during the 16th century and with the empire's collapse in the 18th century it came under the rule of both the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and [[Khanate of Kokand]]. The [[Emirate of Bukhara]] remained intact until the 20th century but during the 19th century, for the second time in world history, a European power (the [[Russian Empire]]) began to conquer parts of the region.

=== Russian Tajikistan ===
{{See also|The Great Game|Russian conquest of Turkestan|Russian Turkestan}}

Russian [[Imperialism]] led to the [[Russian Empire]]'s conquest of [[Central Asia]] during the late 19th century's [[Great Game|Imperial Era]]. Between 1864 and 1885, Russia gradually took control of the entire territory of [[Russian Turkestan]], the Tajikistan portion of which had been controlled by the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and [[Khanate of Kokand]]. Russia was interested in gaining access to a supply of [[cotton]] and in the 1870s attempted to switch cultivation in the region from grain to cotton (a strategy later copied and expanded by the Soviets).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} By 1885 Tajikistan's territory was either ruled by the Russian Empire or its [[vassal state]], the Emirate of Bukhara, nevertheless Tajiks felt little Russian influence.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

During the late 19th century the [[Jadid]]ists established themselves as an Islamic social movement throughout the region. Although the Jadidists were pro-modernization and not necessarily anti-Russian, the Russians viewed the movement as a threat.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Russian troops were required to restore order during uprisings against the Khanate of Kokand between 1910 and 1913. Further violence occurred in July 1916 when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers in [[Khujand]] over the threat of forced [[conscription]] during [[World War I]]. Despite Russian troops quickly bringing Khujand back under control, clashes continued throughout the year in various locations in Tajikistan.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 guerrillas throughout Central Asia, known as ''[[basmachi]]'', waged [[Kokand Autonomy|a war]] against [[Bolshevik]] armies in a futile attempt to maintain independence. The Bolsheviks prevailed after a four-year war, in which [[mosque]]s and villages were burned down and the population heavily suppressed. Soviet authorities started a campaign of secularisation. Practising [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], and [[Christianity]] was discouraged and repressed, and many mosques, [[church (building)|churches]], and [[synagogue]]s were closed.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pipes|first1=Richard|title=Muslims of Soviet Central Asia: Trends and Prospects (Part I)|journal=Middle East Journal|date=1955|volume=9|issue=2|pages=149–150|jstor=4322692}}</ref> As a consequence of the conflict and Soviet agriculture policies, [[Central Asia]], Tajikistan included, suffered a famine that claimed many lives.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Country Study: Tajikistan, Impact of the Civil War|url=http://countrystudies.us/tajikistan/6.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304210235/http://countrystudies.us/tajikistan/6.htm|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref>

In 1924, the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created as a part of [[Uzbekistan]], but in 1929 the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic (Tajik SSR) was made a separate constituent republic; however, the predominantly ethnic Tajik cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Bukhara]] remained in the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]]. Between 1927 and 1934, [[collectivisation]] of agriculture and a rapid expansion of cotton production took place, especially in the southern region.<ref name="countrystudies.us">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/tajikistan/9.htm|title=Tajikistan – Collectivization|work=countrystudies.us|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014202805/http://countrystudies.us/tajikistan/9.htm|archivedate=14 October 2012}}</ref> Soviet collectivisation policy brought violence against peasants and forced resettlement occurred throughout Tajikistan.

Almost immediately after independence, Tajikistan was plunged into a civil war that saw various factions fighting one another. These factions were supported by foreign countries including [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Russia]]. Russia and Iran focused on keeping peace in the warring nation to decrease the chance of [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Turkey]] involvement. Most notably, Russia backed the pro-government faction and deployed troops from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] to guard the Tajikistan-Afghan border.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-r.org/accord-article/tajik-civil-war-causes-and-dynamics|title=The Tajik civil war: Causes and dynamics|date=2011-12-30|website=Conciliation Resources|language=en|access-date=2019-03-10}}</ref> All but 25,000 of the more than 400,000 ethnic Russians, who were mostly employed in industry, fled to Russia. By 1997, the war had cooled down, and a central government began to take form, with peaceful elections in 1999.

"Longtime observers of Tajikistan often characterize the country as profoundly averse to risk and skeptical of promises of reform, a political passivity they trace to the country’s ruinous civil war," Ilan Greenberg wrote in a news article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' just before the country's November 2006 presidential election.<ref name=greenberg>Greenberg, Ilan, "Media Muzzled and Opponents Jailed, Tajikistan Readies for Vote", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 4 November 2006 (article dateline 3 November 2006), page A7, New York edition</ref>

Tajikistan is officially a republic, and holds [[Elections in Tajikistan|elections]] for the [[List of Presidents of Tajikistan|presidency]] and [[parliament]], operating under a [[presidential system]]. It is, however, a [[dominant-party system]], where the [[People's Democratic Party of Tajikistan]] routinely has a vast majority in [[Parliament]]. [[Emomali Rahmon]] has held the office of [[President of Tajikistan]] continually since November 1994. The Prime Minister is [[Kokhir Rasulzoda]], the First Deputy Prime Minister is Matlubkhon Davlatov and the two Deputy Prime Ministers are Murodali Alimardon and Ruqiya Qurbanova.

The parliamentary elections of 2005 aroused many accusations from opposition parties and international observers that President [[Emomali Rahmon]] corruptly manipulates the election process and unemployment. The most recent elections, in February 2010, saw the ruling PDPT lose four seats in Parliament, yet still maintain a comfortable majority. The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] election observers said the 2010 polling "failed to meet many key OSCE commitments" and that "these elections failed on many basic democratic standards."<ref name="economistchange" /><ref name="BBC2010election" /> The government insisted that only minor violations had occurred, which would not affect the will of the Tajik people.<ref name="economistchange">{{cite news|title=Change you can't believe in|newspaper=[[The Economist]]|date=4 March 2010|url=http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15612447&source=hptextfeature|accessdate=5 March 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230010535/http://www.economist.com/world/asia/displayStory.cfm?story_id=15612447&source=hptextfeature|archivedate=30 December 2016}}</ref><ref name="BBC2010election">{{cite news|title=Tajikistan elections criticised by poll watchdog|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=1 March 2010|accessdate=5 March 2010|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8543214.stm|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304194250/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8543214.stm|archivedate=4 March 2010}}</ref>

Freedom of the press is ostensibly officially guaranteed by the government, but independent press outlets remain restricted, as does a substantial amount of web content. According to the Institute for War & Peace Reporting, access is blocked to local and foreign websites including avesta.tj, Tjknews.com, ferghana.ru, centrasia.org and journalists are often obstructed from reporting on controversial events. In practice, no public criticism of the regime is tolerated and all direct protest is severely suppressed and does not receive coverage in the local media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iwpr.net/report-news/tajik-government%E2%80%99s-fury-over-conflict-reporting|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140926061259/http://iwpr.net/report-news/tajik-government%E2%80%99s-fury-over-conflict-reporting|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 September 2014|title=Tajik Government's Fury Over Conflict Reporting|publisher=Iwpr.net|date=22 October 2010|accessdate=14 January 2011}}</ref>

Tajikistan is [[landlocked country|landlocked]], and is the smallest nation in Central Asia by area. It lies mostly between latitudes [[36th parallel north|36°]] and [[41st parallel north|41° N]], and longitudes [[67th meridian east|67°]] and [[75th meridian east|75° E]]. It is covered by mountains of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] range, and more than fifty percent of the country is over {{convert|3000|m|ft}} above [[sea level]]. The only major areas of lower land are in the north (part of the [[Fergana Valley]]), and in the southern [[Kofarnihon River|Kofarnihon]] and [[Vakhsh River|Vakhsh]] river valleys, which form the Amu Darya. [[Dushanbe]] is located on the southern slopes above the Kofarnihon valley.

[[File:Tajik mountains edit.jpg|thumb|Mountains of Tajikistan]]
Tajikistan consists of 4 administrative divisions. These are the provinces ([[viloyat]]) of [[Sughd]] and [[Khatlon]], the autonomous province of [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province|Gorno-Badakhshan]] (abbreviated as GBAO), and the [[Region of Republican Subordination]] (RRP&nbsp;– Raiony Respublikanskogo Podchineniya in [[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]] from Russian or NTJ – Ноҳияҳои тобеи ҷумҳурӣ in [[Tajik language|Tajik]]; formerly known as [[Karotegin Province]]). Each region is divided into several districts, ({{lang-tg|Ноҳия}}, ''nohiya'' or ''raion''), which in turn are subdivided into ''jamoats'' (village-level self-governing units) and then villages (''qyshloqs''). {{As of|2006}}, there were 58 districts and 367 jamoats in Tajikistan.<ref name=pop2008 />

Nearly 47% of Tajikistan's GDP comes from [[immigrant]] [[remittances]] (mostly from Tajiks working in [[Russia]]n Federation).<ref>"[https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21584999-russia-attempts-draw-tajikistan-and-kyrgyzstan-back-its-orbit-remittance-man Remittance man] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118154816/https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21584999-russia-attempts-draw-tajikistan-and-kyrgyzstan-back-its-orbit-remittance-man |date=18 November 2017 }}". The Economist. 7 September 2013.</ref><ref name="youtube.com" /> The current economic situation remains fragile, largely owing to [[corruption]], uneven economic reforms, and economic mismanagement. With foreign revenue precariously dependent upon remittances from migrant workers overseas and exports of aluminium and cotton, the economy is highly vulnerable to external shocks. In FY 2000, international assistance remained an essential source of support for rehabilitation programs that reintegrated former civil war combatants into the civilian economy, which helped keep the peace. International assistance also was necessary to address the second year of severe [[drought]] that resulted in a continued shortfall of food production. On 21 August 2001, the [[Red Cross]] announced that a [[famine]] was striking Tajikistan, and called for international aid for Tajikistan and [[Uzbekistan]]; however, access to food remains a problem today. In January 2012, 680,152 of the people living in Tajikistan were living with [[food insecurity]]. Out of those, 676,852 were at risk of Phase 3 (Acute Food and Livelihoods Crisis) food insecurity and 3,300 were at risk of Phase 4 (Humanitarian Emergency). Those with the highest risk of food insecurity were living in the remote [[Murghob District]] of [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province|GBAO]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Integrated Food Security Phase Classification|url = http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/ena/wfp245412.pdf|website = usaid.gov|publisher = USAID|accessdate = 9 August 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140810013040/http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/ena/wfp245412.pdf|archivedate = 10 August 2014|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

In 2013 Tajikistan, like many of the other Central Asian countries, was experiencing major development in its transportation sector.

As a landlocked country Tajikistan has no ports and the majority of transportation is via roads, air, and rail. In recent years Tajikistan has pursued agreements with [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]] to gain port access in those countries via [[Afghanistan]]. In 2009, an agreement was made between Tajikistan, Pakistan, and Afghanistan to improve and build a 1,300&nbsp;km (810&nbsp;mi) highway and rail system connecting the three countries to Pakistan's ports.

=== Culture ===
{{Main|Culture of Tajikistan}}
{{See also|Music of Tajikistan|Tajik literature|Public holidays in Tajikistan|Tajik cuisine}}


The [[Tajik language]] is the mother tongue of around 80% of the citizens of Tajikistan. The main urban centres in today's Tajikistan include [[Dushanbe]] (the capital), [[Khujand]], [[Kulob]], [[Panjakent]], [[Qurghonteppa]], [[Khorugh]] and [[Istaravshan]]. There are also [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and [[Russians|Russian]] minorities.

The [[Pamiri people]] of [[Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Province]] in the southeast, bordering Afghanistan and China, though considered part of the [[Tajik people|Tajik ethnicity]], nevertheless are distinct linguistically and culturally from most Tajiks. In contrast to the mostly [[Sunni Muslim]] residents of the rest of Tajikistan, the Pamiris overwhelmingly follow the [[Ismaili]] branch of Shia Islam, and speak a number of [[Eastern Iranian]] languages, including [[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Rushani language|Rushani]], [[Khufi language|Khufi]] and [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]]. Isolated in the highest parts of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] Mountains, they have preserved many ancient cultural traditions and folk arts that have been largely lost elsewhere in the country.
[[File:Yaghnobi boy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|[[Yaghnobi people|Yaghnobi]] boy]]
The [[Yaghnobi people]] live in mountainous areas of northern Tajikistan. The estimated number of Yaghnobis is now about 25,000. Forced migrations in the 20th century decimated their numbers. They speak the [[Yaghnobi language]], which is the only direct modern descendant of the ancient [[Sogdian language]].

Tajikistan artisans created the [[Dushanbe Tea House]], which was presented in 1988 as a gift to the sister city of [[Boulder, Colorado]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120527123614/http://www.boulder-dushanbe.org/teahouse.html The Dushanbe-Boulder tea house]. boulder-dushanbe.org</ref>

[[Bukharan Jews]] had lived in Tajikistan since the 2nd century BC, but today almost none are left. In the 1940s, the Jewish community of Tajikistan numbered nearly 30,000 people. Most were  Persian-speaking Bukharan Jews who had lived in the region for millennia along with  Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe who resettled there in the Soviet era.

Relationships between religious groups are generally amicable, although there is some concern among mainstream Muslim leaders{{Who|date=October 2010}} that minority religious groups undermine national unity. There is a concern for religious institutions becoming active in the political sphere. The [[Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan|Islamic Renaissance Party]] (IRP), a major combatant in the [[Tajikistan Civil War|1992–1997 Civil War]] and then-proponent of the creation of an [[State religion#Islamic states|Islamic state]] in Tajikistan, constitutes no more than 30% of the government by statute.

By law, religious communities must register by the State Committee on Religious Affairs (SCRA) and with local authorities. Registration with the SCRA requires a charter, a list of 10 or more members, and evidence of local government approval prayer site location. Religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer. Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of place of worship. There are reports that registration on the local level is sometimes difficult to obtain.<ref>[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=190 TAJIKISTAN: Religious freedom survey, November 2003] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613013715/http://forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=190 |date=13 June 2010 }} -[[Forum 18]] News Service, 20 November 2003</ref> People under the age of 18 are also barred from public religious practice.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper U.

== Sport ==
The national sport of Tajikistan is [[gushtigiri]], a form of traditional wrestling.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ibbotson|first1=Sophie|last2=Lovell-Hoare|first2=Max|title=Tajikistan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nm9DI7nu6CoC&pg=PA22|year=2013|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=978-1-84162-455-6|page=22}}</ref>

Another popular sport is [[buzkashi]], a game played on horseback, like [[polo]]. One plays it on one's own and in teams. The aim of the game is to grab a 50&nbsp;kg dead goat, ride clear of the other players, get back to the starting point and drop it in a designated circle. It is also practised in Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. It is often played at [[Nowruz]] celebrations.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abdullaev|first1=Kamoludin|last2=Akbarzaheh|first2=Shahram|title=Historical Dictionary of Tajikistan|publisher=Scarecrow Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PB5xgFRuYPUC&pg=PA85|isbn=978-0-8108-7379-7|page=85|date=2010-04-27}}</ref>

Tajikistan's mountains provide many opportunities for outdoor sports, such as hill climbing, mountain biking, rock climbing, skiing, snowboarding, hiking, and mountain climbing. The facilities are limited, however. Mountain climbing and hiking tours to the Fann and Pamir Mountains, including the 7,000&nbsp;m peaks in the region, are seasonally organised by local and international alpine agencies.

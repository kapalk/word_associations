It borders [[Peru]] to the north, [[Bolivia]] to the northeast, [[Argentina]] to the east, and the [[Drake Passage]] in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of [[Juan Fernández Islands|Juan Fernández]], [[Salas y Gómez]], [[Desventuradas Islands|Desventuradas]], and [[Easter Island]] in [[Oceania]]. Chile also claims about {{convert|1250000|km2}} of [[Antarctica]], although all claims are suspended under the [[Antarctic Treaty]].

The arid [[Atacama Desert]] in northern Chile contains great mineral wealth, principally [[Copper#Production|copper]]. The relatively small central area dominates in terms of population and agricultural resources, and is the cultural and political center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century when it incorporated its northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests and grazing lands, and features a string of [[volcano]]es and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of [[Fjords and channels of Chile|fjords, inlets, canals]], twisting peninsulas, and islands.<ref name="USDoS">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/chile/192190.htm|title=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, Background Note: Chile|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|date=16 December 2011|access-date=28 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706191625/https://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/chile/192190.htm|archive-date=6 July 2018|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Chile}}

===Early history===
Stone tool evidence indicates humans sporadically frequented the [[Monte Verde]] valley area as long as 18,500 years ago.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/people-roamed-tip-south-america-18500-years-ago | title=People roamed tip of South America 18,500 years ago | work=Science News | date=26 December 2015 | accessdate=26 December 2015 | author=Bower, Bruce | pages=10}}</ref> About 10,000 years ago, migrating [[Indigenous Peoples of the Americas|indigenous Peoples]] settled in fertile valleys and coastal areas of what is present-day Chile. Settlement sites from very early human habitation include Monte Verde, [[Cueva del Milodón]] and the [[Pali-Aike Crater]]'s [[lava tube]]. The Incas briefly extended their empire into what is now northern Chile, but the [[Mapuche]] (or Araucanians as they were known by the Spaniards) successfully resisted many attempts by the [[Inca Empire]] to subjugate them, despite their lack of state organization.<ref>{{cite book|title=Insight Guides: Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nf8SnJ_ZJbkC&pg=PA27|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=2002|publisher=Langenscheidt Publishing Group|isbn=978-981-234-890-6|page=27}}</ref> They fought against the Sapa Inca Tupac Yupanqui and his army. The result of the bloody three-day confrontation known as the [[Battle of the Maule]] was that the Inca conquest of the territories of Chile ended at the [[Maule river]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>

===Spanish colonization===
{{main|Conquest of Chile|Colonial Chile}}
[[File:Lautaro (de Pedro Subercaseaux).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Lautaro]], ''[[toqui]]'' and hero of the [[Arauco war]]]]

In 1520, while attempting to circumnavigate the globe, [[Ferdinand Magellan]] discovered the southern passage now named after him (the [[Strait of Magellan]]) thus becoming the first European to set foot on what is now Chile. The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadors]], who came from [[Peru]] in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture and hunting.<ref name="countrystudies"/>
[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Pedro de Valdivia]], conqueror of Chile]]
The conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Conquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=Bárbaros, page 66. David J. Weber |publisher=Archive.org }}</ref>

Cut off to the north by desert, to the south by the Mapuche, to the east by the Andes Mountains, and to the west by the ocean, Chile became one of the most centralized, homogeneous colonies in Spanish America. Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the [[British Empire|British]] and the Dutch. Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valparaíso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].<ref name="hudson"/>

The first general census was conducted by the government of [[Agustín de Jáuregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5 percent of [[White Latin American|European descent]], 7.9 percent [[mestizo]]s, 8.6 percent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and 9.8 percent blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of [[Chiloé Province|Chiloé]], conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4 percent of whom were whites and 33.5 percent of whom were natives.

The Diocese of [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]] conducted a census in areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chiloé. The population is estimated at 210,567, 86.1 percent of whom were [[Spanish Chilean|Spanish]] or of European descent, 10 percent of whom were indigenous and 3.7 percent of whom were mestizos, blacks and [[mulatto]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.cl/canales/usuarios/cedoc_online/censos/pdf/censo_1813.pdf |title=INE – Censo de 1813.

===Independence and nation building===
{{see also|Chilean War of Independence|War of the Pacific|Argentine–Chilean naval arms race}}
[[File:Ohiggins.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]], ''[[Libertadores|Libertador]]'' and the Supreme Director of Chile]]
In 1808, [[Napoleon I|Napoleon's]] enthronement of his brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] as the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish King]] precipitated the drive by the colony for [[Chilean War of Independence|independence from Spain]]. A national [[Junta (governing body)|junta]] in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] – heir to the deposed king – was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day, Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September each year).

After these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[José Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan José and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.

Intermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[José de San Martín]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Chile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chiloé was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Chañarcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valparaíso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying [[Occupation of Araucanía|penetration into Araucanía]] and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes region]] joined the country in 1843, while the [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta region]], at the time part of Bolivia, began to fill with people.

[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879. The victory of Chile in the [[War of the Pacific]] allowed its expansion into new territories.]]

Toward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucanía]]. The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879–83), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=137|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref>

The [[1891 Chilean Civil War]] brought about a redistribution of power between the President and Congress, and Chile established a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] style democracy. However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a [[Argentine–Chilean naval arms race|vastly expensive naval arms race]] with [[Argentina]] that nearly led to war.

The Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

A military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ibáñez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a [[de facto]] dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that has often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Geenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0-313-29843-2|pages=30–96}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo |title=Salt in the Sand: Memory, Violence, and the Nation-State in Chile, 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=17 July 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4003-4|pages=163–184}}</ref>

By relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ibáñez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932–52), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ibáñez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ibáñez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.

The [[Chilean presidential election, 1964|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan "Revolution in Liberty", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name="countrystudies">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830–1973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=31 March 1994}}</ref>

[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Salvador Allende]]]]

In the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (then part of the "[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]]" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name="countrystudies"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party. Allende was not elected with an absolute majority, receiving fewer than 35 percent of votes.

The [[National Congress of Chile|Chilean Congress]] conducted a runoff vote between the leading candidates, Allende and former president Jorge Alessandri, and, keeping with tradition, chose Allende by a vote of 153 to 35. Frei refused to form an alliance with Alessandri to oppose Allende, on the grounds that the Christian Democrats were a workers' party and could not make common cause with the right wing.<ref>{{Cite book|last= Mares|first=David|author2=Francisco Rojas Aravena|title=The United States and Chile: Coming in from the Cold|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y3EWkKZsYcC&pg=PA145|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-93125-0|page=145}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Trento|first=Joseph J.|title=The Secret History Of The CIA|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3uPBM7z_62gC&pg=PA560|accessdate=14 July 2013|year=2005|publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers|isbn=978-0-7867-1500-8|page=560}}</ref>

An [[economic depression]] that began in 1972 was exacerbated by [[capital flight]], plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose.

The current [[Constitution of Chile]] was approved in a national [[plebiscite]]—regarded as "highly irregular" by some observers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cltoc.html|title=A Country Study: Chile|work=[[United States Library of Congress]]}}</ref>—in September 1980, under the military government of Augusto Pinochet. It entered into force in March 1981. After Pinochet's defeat in the [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|1988 plebiscite]], the constitution was amended to ease provisions for future amendments to the Constitution. In September 2005, President Ricardo Lagos signed into law several constitutional amendments passed by Congress. These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4157908.stm|title=Chile scraps Pinochet-era system|publisher=BBC | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>

The [[Congress of Chile]] has a 38-seat [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] and a 120-member [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]]. Senators serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The last congressional elections were held on 17 November 2013, concurrently with the presidential election. The current Senate has a 21–15 split in favor of the governing coalition and 2 independents. The current lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, contains 67 members of the governing center-left coalition, 48 from the center-right opposition and 5 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valparaíso, about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the capital, Santiago.

[[File:Congresschile.jpg|thumb|[[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] building in [[Valparaíso]]]]

Chile's congressional elections are governed by a [[Binomial System|binomial system]] that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally, often regardless of their relative popular support. Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertación and Alianza) split most of the seats. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislature in a roughly 50–50 split.

Chile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&option=com_content&task=view |work=Chilean Government |title=President Lagos: We can make a greater effort to make yesterday's and today's trials equally just |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423171251/http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&option=com_content&task=view |archivedate=23 April 2008 }}</ref> The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.

In the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI) surpassed the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. In the [[Chilean parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their respective allies [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] (which became the biggest party in the Concertación block) and [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] in the right-wing alliance. In the 2009 legislative elections in Chile, the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years (the Communist Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship).

Chileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on 17 November 2013. None of the nine presidential candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote. As a result, the top two candidates, center-left [[Nueva Mayoría]] coalition's [[Michelle Bachelet]] and center-right [[Alianza (Chile)|Alianza]] coalition's [[Evelyn Matthei]], competed in a run-off election on 15 December 2013, which Bachelet won. This was Chile's sixth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All six have been judged free and fair. The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.

Since the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of [[Callao]] for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836–39) in the [[War of the Confederation]]. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–83), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.<ref name="hudson"/>

During the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a nation that had a major influence on the formation of the Chilean navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the 20th century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by [[Prussia]]ns.<ref name="hudson"/>

Since its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a Chilean national, was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States in May 2005 and confirmed in his position, being re-elected in 2009. Chile is currently serving on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, and the 2007–2008 chair of the board is Chile's ambassador to the IAEA, Milenko E. Skoknic. The country is an active member of the UN family of agencies and participates in UN peacekeeping activities.

=== Border Disputes with Peru ===
There have been long arguments between Chileans and Peruvians since the 1800s because they both claim boundary coastal lines. Peruvians claim the Northern part of Chile, which is now South West of Peru. This also known as the "triangulation" which was made to fix the boundary problem between Chile and Peru. The decisions were accomplished on January 27, 1839 by the International Court of Justice <ref>{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Peter H. |title=Chile, Peru, and the ICJ Boundary Settlement |url=http://blogs.law.unc.edu/ncilj/2014/02/24/chile-peru-and-the-icj-boundary-settlement/ |website=North Carolina Journal of International Law |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> This became the War of the Pacific which was in the years 1879-1883.<ref>{{cite web |title=War of the Pacific |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-the-Pacific |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> This  was caused by the mineral resources Chile had making Peruvians believe it belong to them as well. Chile had to control Sea Shipping to Peru and send out and army to invade Peru on October 8, 1879. The attempt was also made to The United States but failed badly on October 1880. There was a resistance between Peruvians and Chileans for a few years because they couldn't agree. The United States offered help with a treaty for both Peru and Chile, better known as the Treaty of Ancón. This was later signed by both of them on October 20, 1883 to keep peace between them. In 2008, Peru took Chile to court over their maritime disputes. Then later in 2014, the International Court of Justice's ruling resulted in Chile losing 80 miles from Northwestern ocean zone.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bonnefoy |first1=Pascale |title=Court Grants Peru Ocean Territory Claimed by Chile |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/world/americas/court-grants-peru-ocean-territory-claimed-by-chile.html |website=New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> This ruling severely impacted fishers in the country making Chile lose a valuable trade in Northwest Chile.

The Chilean Government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It settled all its territorial disputes with Argentina during the 1990s except for part of the border at [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]. Chile and Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in 1978 over Bolivia's desire to regain sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean after its lost to Chile in 1879–83 War of the Pacific. The two countries maintain consular relations and are represented at the Consul General level.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

Each region is designated by a name and a [[Roman numeral]] assigned from north to south, except for the [[Santiago Metropolitan Region]], which does not have a number. The creation of two new regions in 2007, Arica and Parinacota (XV) and Los Ríos (XIV), and a third region in 2018, Ñuble (XVI) made this numbering lose its original order meaning.

===National symbols===
The national flower is the [[copihue]] (''Lapageria rosea'', Chilean [[Campanula|bellflower]]), which grows in the woods of southern Chile.

The [[Coat of arms of Chile|coat of arms]] depicts the two national animals: the [[condor]] (''Vultur gryphus'', a very large bird that lives in the mountains) and the [[Hippocamelus|huemul]] (''Hippocamelus bisulcus,'' an endangered white tail deer). It also has the legend ''Por la razón o la fuerza'' (''By reason or by force'').

The [[flag of Chile]] consists of two equal horizontal bands of white (top) and red; there is a blue square the same height as the white band at the hoist-side end of the white band; the square bears a white five-pointed star in the center representing a guide to progress and honor; blue symbolizes the sky, white is for the snow-covered Andes, and red stands for the blood spilled to achieve independence. The flag of Chile is similar to the [[Flag of Texas]], although the Chilean flag is 21 years older. However, like the Texan flag, the flag of Chile is modeled after the [[Flag of the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/flags/countrys/samerica/chile.htm |title=Chile flag and description |publisher=Worldatlas.com |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref>

A long and narrow coastal [[Southern Cone]] country on the west side of the [[Andes Mountains]], Chile stretches over {{convert|4300|km|-1|abbr=on}} north to south, but only {{convert|350|km|0|abbr=on}} at its widest point east to west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111326/Chile |title=Chile |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=7 May 2013}}</ref> This encompasses a remarkable variety of climates and landscapes. It contains {{convert|756950|km2}} of land area. It is situated within the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].

Chile is among the longest north-south countries in the world.

The northern [[Atacama Desert]] contains great mineral wealth, primarily [[Copper#Production|copper]] and [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]]s. The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area is also the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands. The Andes Mountains are located on the eastern border.

The diverse [[climate of Chile]] ranges from the world's driest desert in the north—the [[Atacama Desert]]—through a [[Mediterranean climate]] in the center, [[humid subtropical]] in Easter Island, to an [[oceanic climate]], including [[alpine tundra]] and [[glaciers]] in the east and south.<ref name="BBC-Chile">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1222764.stm|title=Country profile: Chile |work=BBC News | date=16 December 2009 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref> According to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], Chile within its borders hosts at least ten major climatic subtypes.

===Biodiversity===
{{main|Wildlife of Chile}}

The flora and fauna of Chile are characterized by a high degree of endemism, due to its particular geography. In continental Chile, the [[Atacama Desert]] in the north and the [[Andes Mountains|Andes mountains]] to the east are barriers that have led to the isolation of flora and fauna. Add to that the enormous length of Chile (over {{convert|4300|km|0|abbr=on}}) and this results in a wide range of climates and environments that can be divided into three general zones: the desert provinces of the north, central Chile, and the humid regions of the south.

==== Flora and fauna====

[[File:Zorrito Chile.JPG|thumb|right|Chilla fox, common in the region.]]

The native flora of Chile consists of relatively fewer species compared to the flora of other South American countries. 
The northernmost coastal and central region is largely barren of vegetation, approaching the most absolute desert in the world.<ref name=Icarito>{{Cite journal |author-link=La Tercera/Icarito |title=Icarito: Enciclopedia de la flora y fauna de Chile |journal=Icarito |url=http://www.icarito.cl/icarito/enciclopedia/canal/canal/0,0,38035857_152308989,00.html |id= |postscript=<!--None--> |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410080253/http://www.icarito.cl/icarito/enciclopedia/canal/canal/0%2C0%2C38035857_152308989%2C00.html |archivedate=10 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
On the slopes of the Andes, in addition to the scattered tola desert brush, grasses are found. The central valley is characterized by several species of cacti, the hardy [[Acacia caven|espinos]], the [[Araucaria araucana|Chilean pine]], the [[nothofagus|southern beeches]] and the [[copihue]], a red bell-shaped flower that is Chile's national flower.<ref name= Icarito/>

In southern Chile, south of the Biobío River, heavy precipitation has produced dense forests of laurels, magnolias, and various species of conifers and beeches, which become smaller and more stunted to the south.<ref name="Bio&Con">{{Cite journal | last = Smith-Ramírez | first = Cecilia | title = Distribution patterns of flora and fauna in southern Chilean Coastal rain forests: Integrating Natural History and GIS | journal = Biodiversity and Conservation | issue = Volume 16, Number 9 / August 2007 | publisher = Springer Netherlands | date = 27 October 2006 | doi = 10.1007/s10531-006-9073-2 }}</ref>
The cold temperatures and winds of the extreme south preclude heavy forestation. Grassland is found in Atlantic Chile (in Patagonia). Much of the Chilean flora is distinct from that of neighboring Argentina, indicating that the Andean barrier existed during its formation.<ref name="Bio&Con"/>
[[File:Colca-condor-c07.jpg|thumb|left|[[Andean condor]] (''Vultur gryphus''), the national bird of Chile.]]
Some of Chile's flora has an Antarctic origin due to [[land bridge]]s which formed during the Cretaceous ice ages, allowing plants to migrate from Antarctica to South America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chilean-and-antarctic-fossils-reveal-the-last-geologic-minutes-of-the-age-of-dinosaurs-slide-show/|title=Chilean and Antarctic Fossils Reveal the Last "Geologic Minutes" of the Age of Dinosaurs [Slide Show]|first=Ángela|last=Posada-Swafford|publisher=}}</ref>

Chile's geographical isolation has restricted the immigration of faunal life, so that only a few of the many distinctive South American animals are found. Among the larger mammals are the [[Cougar|puma]] or cougar, the llama-like [[guanaco]] and the fox-like [[South American gray fox|chilla]]. In the forest region, several types of marsupials and a small deer known as the [[Pudú|pudu]] are found.<ref name= Icarito/>

There are many species of small birds, but most of the larger common Latin American types are absent. Few freshwater fish are native, but North American trout have been successfully introduced into the Andean lakes.<ref name= Icarito/> Owing to the vicinity of the Humboldt Current, ocean waters abound with fish and other forms of marine life, which in turn support a rich variety of waterfowl, including several penguins. Whales are abundant, and some six species of seals are found in the area.<ref name= Icarito/>

=== Topography ===
[[File:Chile topo en.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Topographic map of Chile. To view maps based on [[SRTM]] topographic relief of the country, see [[:commons:Atlas of Chile/Clickable map|here]].]]
[[File:Majestic Ojos del Salado volcano (4320230217).jpg|thumbnail|View of [[Ojos del Salado]] from the Chilean side.]]

Chile is located along a highly [[seismic]] and [[volcanic]] zone, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, due to the subduction of the Nazca and Antarctic plates in the [[South American plate]].

Late [[Paleozoic]], 251 million years ago, Chile belonged to the continental block called Gondwana. It was just a depression accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.

The Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] in the [[Atacama Region|region of Atacama]] and the Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes. Chile's highest peak is the [[Nevado Ojos del Salado]], at 6891.3 m, which is also the highest volcano in the world. The highest point of the Coastal Range is Vicuña Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicuña Mackenna, the south of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]]. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.

The [[Far North, Chile|Far North]] is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] 26° S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the [[Atacama desert]], the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the [[Pampa del Tamarugal|pampas Tamarugal]]. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs [[Bolivia]], has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the [[Salar de Atacama]], due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.
[[File:Volcano Osorno and Petrohué waterfalls.JPG|thumbnail|[[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno Volcano]] and the [[Petrohué River]]]]
[[File:Glaciar y laguna Nef, afluente Baker,.JPG|thumbnail|[[Nef Glacier]] and the Plomo Lake]]

To the south is the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], extending to the [[Aconcagua River|Aconcagua river]]. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90&nbsp;km away at the height of [[Illapel]], the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of [[Transverse Valleys|transverse valleys]], where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the [[coastal plains]] begin to expand.

The [[Zona Central, Chile|Central]] area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the [[Nahuelbuta Range|range of Nahuelbuta]] while glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]].

Patagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41°S, to the south. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation|last glaciation]], this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]], disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47°S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused [[fjords]].

East of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the [[Tierra del Fuego (main island)|island of Tierra del Fuego]] are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.

The Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53°W and 90°W.

In the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.


=== Hydrography ===
[[File:Lago General Carrera - Camino a Capilla de Mármol.JPG|thumb|left|[[General Carrera Lake|General Carrera lake]], the largest in the country.]]

Due to the characteristics of the territory, Chile is crossed by numerous rivers generally short in length and with low torrential flow. They commonly extend from the [[Andes Mountains|Andes]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], flowing in an East to West.

Because of the [[Atacama desert]], in the Norte Grande there are only short [[endorheic]] character streams, except for the [[Loa River]], the longest in the country 440&nbsp;km.<ref name=hydr>{{cite journal |author1=Niemeyer, Hans  |author2=Cereceda, Pilar |year=1983 |title=Hydrography |work=Geography of Chile |publisher=[[Military Geographic Institute (Chile)|Military Geographic Institute]] |edition=1st |location=Santiago |volume=8 }}</ref> In the high valleys, wetland areas generate [[Chungará Lake]], located at 4500 meters above sea level. It and the [[Lauca River]] are shared with [[Bolivia]], as well as the [[Lluta River]].

In the center-north of the country, the number of rivers that form valleys of agricultural importance increases. Noteworthy are the Elqui with 75&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> long, 142&nbsp;km Aconcagua, Maipo with 250&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> and its tributary, the Mapocho with 110&nbsp;km, and Maule with 240&nbsp;km. Their waters mainly flow from Andean snowmelt in the summer and winter rains. The major lakes in this area are the artificial lake Rapel, the Colbun Maule lagoon and the lagoon of La Laja.

=== Languages ===
The [[Chilean Spanish|Spanish spoken in Chile]] is distinctively accented and quite unlike that of neighboring South American countries because final syllables are often dropped, and some consonants have a soft pronunciation.{{clarify|reason=Which consonants and what kind of soft pronunciation?|date=April 2018}} Accent varies only very slightly from north to south; more noticeable are the differences in accent based on social class or whether one lives in the city or the country. That the Chilean population was largely formed in a small section at the center of the country and then migrated in modest numbers to the north and south helps explain this relative lack of differentiation, which was maintained by the national reach of radio, and now television, which also helps to diffuse and homogenize colloquial expressions.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

In Chile, education begins with [[preschool]] until the age of 5. [[Primary school]] is provided for children between ages 6 and 13. Students then attend [[secondary school]] until graduation at age 17.

Secondary education is divided into two parts: During the first two years, students receive a general education. Then, they choose a branch: scientific humanistic education, artistic education, or technical and professional education. Secondary school ends two years later on the acquirement of a certificate (licencia de enseñanza media).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=CHL|title=Chile Country Profile, UNESCO-UNEVOC|publisher=}}</ref>

Chilean education is segregated by wealth in a three-tiered system — the quality of the schools reflect socioeconomic backgrounds:
* city schools (colegios municipales) that are mostly free and have the worse education results, mostly attended by poor students;
* subsidized schools that receive some money from the government which can be supplemented by fees paid by the student's family, which are attended by mid-income students and typically get mid-level results; and 
* entirely private schools that consistently get the best results. Many private schools charge attendance fees of 0,5 to 1 median household incomes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2013/12/30/637336/mensualidad-en-colegios-top-10-en-la-psu-supera-los-250-mil.html |title=Mensualidad de los colegios con los mejores puntajes en la PSU supera los mil |publisher=Emol.com |date=30 December 2013 |accessdate=18 July 2014}}</ref>

Upon successful graduation of secondary school, students may continue into [[higher education]]. The higher education schools in Chile consist of [[Chilean Traditional Universities]] and are divided into [[Public university|public universities]] or [[Private university|private universities]]. There are [[List of medical schools in South America#Chile|medical schools]] and both the [[Universidad de Chile]] and [[Universidad Diego Portales]] offer [[Legal education|law schools]] in a partnership with [[Yale University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.yale.edu/linkageinchili.htm |title=Program in Chile &#124; Yale Law School |publisher=Law.yale.edu |accessdate=22 December 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Fonasa.jpg|thumb|right|upright|FONASA is the funding branch of the Ministry of Health.]]
The [[Ministry of Health (Chile)|Ministry of Health]] (''Minsal'') is the cabinet-level administrative office in charge of planning, directing, coordinating, executing, controlling and informing the public health policies formulated by the President of Chile. The [[Fondo Nacional de Salud|National Health Fund]] (''Fonasa''), created in 1979, is the financial entity entrusted to collect, manage and distribute state funds for health in Chile. It is funded by the public. All employees pay 7 percent of their monthly income to the fund.{{fact|date=February 2019}}

Fonasa is part of the NHSS and has executive power through the [[Ministry of Health (Chile)]]. Its headquarters are in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] and decentralized public service is conducted by various Regional Offices. More than 12 million beneficiaries benefit from Fonasa. Beneficiaries can also opt for more costly private insurance through [[Isapre]].

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Chile}}
[[File:Vista general de Valle de Casablanca.jpg|thumb|Vineyard in the [[Casablanca Valley]]]]
[[Agriculture]] in Chile encompasses a wide range of different activities due to its particular [[geography]], [[climate]] and [[geology]] and human factors. Historically agriculture is one of the bases of Chile's economy. Now agriculture and allied sectors like [[forestry]], [[logging]] and [[fishing]] account for only 4.9% of the [[GDP]] {{As of|2007|lc=y}} and employ 13.6% of the country's labor force. Some major agriculture products of Chile include [[grapes]], [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[onion]]s, [[wheat]], [[corn]], [[oats]], [[peach]]es, [[garlic]], [[asparagus]], [[bean]]s, [[beef]], [[poultry]], [[wool]], [[fish]], [[timber]] and [[hemp]].[1] Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as [[Mad Cow Disease]], [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] and [[Phylloxera]]. This, its location in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which has quite different harvesting times from the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages. However, Chile's mountainous landscape limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory. Chile currently utilizes 14,015 Hectares of agricultural land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/chile.htm|title=Chile - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2018-11-02}}</ref>

Tourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades. In 2005, tourism grew by 13.6 percent, generating more than 4.5 billion dollars of which 1.5 billion was attributed to foreign tourists. According to the National Service of Tourism (Sernatur), 2 million people a year visit the country. Most of these visitors come from other countries in the American continent, mainly [[Argentina]]; followed by a growing number from the United States, Europe, and [[Brazil]] with a growing number of Asians from [[South Korea]] and [[PR China]].<ref>Blanco, Hernán ''et al.''

The main attractions for tourists are places of natural beauty situated in the extreme zones of the country: [[San Pedro de Atacama]], in the north, is very popular with foreign tourists who arrive to admire the Incaic architecture, the altiplano lakes, and the [[Valle de la Luna (Chile)|Valley of the Moon]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} In [[Putre]], also in the north, there is the [[Chungará Lake]], as well as the [[Parinacota Volcano|Parinacota]] and the [[Pomerape]] volcanoes, with altitudes of 6,348 m and 6,282 m, respectively. Throughout the central Andes there are many ski resorts of international repute,{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} including [[Portillo, Chile|Portillo]], [[Valle Nevado]] and [[Termas de Chillán]].

The main tourist sites in the south are national parks (the most popular is [[Conguillío National Park]] in the Araucanía){{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and the coastal area around Tirúa and Cañete with the [[Isla Mocha]] and the [[Nahuelbuta National Park]], [[Chiloé Archipelago]] and [[Patagonia]], which includes [[Laguna San Rafael National Park]], with its many glaciers, and the [[Torres del Paine National Park]]. The central port city of [[Valparaíso]], which is World Heritage with its unique architecture, is also popular.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Finally, Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean is one of the main Chilean tourist destinations.

For locals, tourism is concentrated mostly in the summer (December to March), and mainly in the coastal beach towns.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Arica]], [[Iquique]], [[Antofagasta]], [[La Serena, Chile|La Serena]] and [[Coquimbo]] are the main summer centers in the north, and Pucón on the shores of [[Lake Villarrica]] is the main center in the south. Because of its proximity to Santiago, the coast of the Valparaíso Region, with its many beach resorts, receives the largest number of tourists. [[Viña del Mar]], Valparaíso's northern affluent neighbor, is popular because of its beaches, [[casino]], and its annual [[Viña del Mar International Song Festival|song festival]], the most important musical event in Latin America.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Pichilemu]] in the [[O'Higgins Region]] is widely known as South America's "best [[surfing]] spot" according to [[Fodor's]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Chile|Music of Chile|Chilean cuisine}}
From the period between early agricultural settlements and up to the late pre-Hispanic period, northern Chile was a region of Andean culture that was influenced by altiplano traditions spreading to the coastal valleys of the north, while southern regions were areas of Mapuche cultural activities. Throughout the colonial period following the conquest, and during the early Republican period, the country's culture was dominated by the Spanish. Other European influences, primarily English, French, and German began in the 19th century and have continued to this day. German migrants influenced the Bavarian style rural architecture and cuisine in the south of Chile in cities such as [[Valdivia]], [[Frutillar]], [[Puerto Varas]], [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], [[Temuco]], [[Puerto Octay]], [[Llanquihue Province|Llanquihue]], [[Faja Maisan]], [[Pitrufquén]], [[Victoria, Chile|Victoria]], [[Pucón]] and [[Puerto Montt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allsouthernchile.com/southamerica/valdivia-southern-chile-city-guide/index.html |title=Valdivia Chile |publisher=Allsouthernchile.com |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919231219/http://www.allsouthernchile.com/southamerica/valdivia-southern-chile-city-guide/index.html |archivedate=19 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=International Web Solutions, Inc. <http://www.iwsinc.net> |url=http://www.globaladrenaline.com/latinamerica/chile/ |title=Latin America :: Chile |publisher=Global Adrenaline |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711100623/http://www.globaladrenaline.com/latinamerica/chile/ |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learnapec.org/index.cfm?action=exploration&cou_id=4 |title=Learning About Each Other |publisher=Learnapec.org |accessdate=1 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429020520/http://www.learnapec.org/index.cfm?action=exploration&cou_id=4 |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.country-studies.com/chile/foreign-relations.html |title=Chile Foreign Relations |publisher=Country-studies.com |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Chile.html |title=Food in Chile – Chilean Food, Chilean Cuisine – traditional, popular, dishes, recipe, diet, history, common, meals, rice, main, people, favorite, customs, fruits, country, bread, vegetables, bread, drink, typical |publisher=Foodbycountry.com |accessdate=1 August 2011}}</ref>

===Music and dance===
[[File:Zamacueca-Chile.jpg|thumb|left|''La Zamacueca'', by Manuel Antonio Caro.]]
Music in Chile ranges from folkloric, popular and classical music. Its large geography generates different musical styles in the north, center and south of the country, including also Easter Island and Mapuche music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/temas/index.asp?id_ut=elfolclordechileysustresgrandesraices |title=Memoria Chilena |publisher=Memoriachilena.cl }}</ref> The national dance is the [[cueca]]. Another form of traditional Chilean song, though not a dance, is the tonada. Arising from music imported by the Spanish colonists, it is distinguished from the cueca by an intermediate melodic section and a more prominent melody.

Between 1950 and 1970 appears a rebirth in folk music leading by groups such as [[Los de Ramón]], Los Cuatro Huasos and Los Huasos Quincheros, among others<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicapopular.cl/2.0/index2.php?op=Artista&id=444 |title=Conjuntos Folkloricos de Chile |publisher=Musicapopular.cl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013104352/http://musicapopular.cl/2.0/index2.php?op=Artista&id=444 |archivedate=13 October 2007 }}</ref> with composers such as [[Raúl de Ramón]], [[Violeta Parra]] and others. In the mid-1960s native musical forms were revitalized by the [[Parra family]] with the [[Nueva canción|Nueva canción Chilena]], which was associated with political activists and reformers such as [[Víctor Jara]], [[Inti-Illimani]], and [[Quilapayún]]. Other important [[folk music|folk]] singer and researcher on [[folklore]] and Chilean [[ethnography]], is [[Margot Loyola]]. Also many Chilean rock bands like [[Los Jaivas]], [[Los Prisioneros]], [[La Ley (band)|La Ley]], and [[Los Tres]] have reached international success.

Most of the traditions of the [[culture of Chile]] have a festive purpose, but some, such as dances and ceremonies, have religious components.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

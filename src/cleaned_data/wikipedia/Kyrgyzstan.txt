Kyrgyzstan's recorded history spans over 2,000 years, encompassing a variety of cultures and empires. Although geographically isolated by its highly mountainous terrain, which has helped preserve its ancient culture, Kyrgyzstan has been at the crossroads of several great civilizations as part of the [[Silk Road]] and other commercial and cultural routes. Though long inhabited by a succession of independent tribes and clans, Kyrgyzstan has periodically fallen under foreign domination and attained sovereignty as a nation-state only after the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.

Ethnic [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] make up the majority of the country's 6 million people, followed by significant minorities of [[Uzbeks]] and [[Russians]]. [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] is closely related to other [[Turkic languages]], although [[Russian language|Russian]] remains widely spoken and is an official language, a legacy of a century of [[Russification]]. The majority of the population are [[non-denominational Muslim]]s.<ref>"Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation". The World's Muslims: Unity and Diversity. Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project. 9 August 2012. Retrieved 4 September 2013</ref> In addition to its Turkic origins, Kyrgyz culture bears elements of [[Persia]]n, [[Mongolia]]n, and Russian influence.

==Etymology==
"Kyrgyz" is believed to have been derived from the Turkic word for "forty", in reference to the forty clans of [[Epic of Manas|Manas]], a legendary hero who united forty regional clans against the [[Uyghur Khaganate|Uyghurs]]. Literally, Kyrgyz means ''We are forty''. At the time, in the early 9th century AD, the Uyghurs dominated much of Central Asia (including Kyrgyzstan), Mongolia, and parts of Russia and China.<ref>[http://www.sras.org/news2.phtml?m=483 Forty tribes and the 40-ray sun on the flag of Kyrgyzstan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007073629/http://www.sras.org/news2.phtml?m=483 |date=7 October 2009 }}, SRAS–The School of Russian and Asian Studies</ref>

The 40-ray sun on the [[flag of Kyrgyzstan]] is a reference to those same forty tribes and the graphical element in the sun's center depicts the wooden crown, called tunduk, of a [[yurt]]—a portable dwelling traditionally used by nomads in the steppes of Central Asia.

In terms of naming conventions, the country's official name is ''"Kyrgyz Republic"'' whenever it is used in some international arenas and foreign relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/kazakhstan/bilateral_relations_bilaterales/canada_kyrgyz-kirghizie.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada – Kyrgyz Republic Relations |publisher=Canadainternational.gc.ca |date=5 July 2018 |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/kyrgyzrepublic |title=The World Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic |publisher=Worldbank.org |date=26 October 2016 |accessdate=20 September 2018}}</ref> However, in the English-speaking world, the spelling ''Kyrgyzstan'' is commonly used while its former name ''Kirghizia'' is rarely used as such.<ref name=Kirghizia>{{cite web|url=https://news.az/articles/politics/129214 |title=Vladimir Putin to meet with Azerbaijani delegation |publisher=News.Az |date=22 February 2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Kyrgyzstan}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:GökturksAD551-572.png|thumb|The [[Turkic Khaganate]].]]
According to David C. King, [[Scythians]] were early settlers in present-day Kyrgyzstan.<ref>{{cite book |title=Kyrgyzstan |year=2005 |publisher= Marshall Cavendish| url=https://books.google.com/?id=UlVVmaoW260C |isbn=978-0-7614-2013-2 |page= 144 |author= King, David C}}</ref>

The [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] state reached its greatest expansion after defeating the [[Uyghur Empire|Uyghur]] Khaganate in 840 A.D.<ref name="Kyrgyzstan timeline">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1296570.stm |title=Kyrgyzstan timeline |publisher=BBC News |date=12 June 2010}}</ref> From the 10th century the Kyrgyz migrated as far as the [[Tian Shan]] range and maintained their dominance over this territory for about 200 years.

In the twelfth century the Kyrgyz dominion had shrunk to the [[Altay Mountains|Altay]] Range and [[Sayan Mountains]] as a result of the [[Mongols before Genghis Khan|Mongol expansion]]. With the rise of the [[Mongol Empire]] in the thirteenth century, the Kyrgyz migrated south. The Kyrgyz peacefully became a part of the Mongol Empire in 1207.

The descent of the Kyrgyz from the [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|indigenous Siberian]] population, on the other hand, is confirmed by recent genetic studies.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = R.

Kyrgyz tribes were overrun in the 17th century by the Mongols, in the mid-18th century by the Manchurian [[Qing Dynasty]], and in the early 19th century by the Uzbek [[Khanate of Kokand]].<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/kyrgyzstan/2.htm Kyrgyzstan–Mongol Domination]" [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].</ref>

===Russian colonial era===
In the late nineteenth century, the eastern part of what is today Kyrgyzstan, mainly the [[Issyk-Kul Region]], was ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] by Qing China through the [[Treaty of Tarbagatai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidrumsey.com/luna/servlet/detail/RUMSEY~8~1~29863~1140598:Chinese-Empire-?showTipAdvancedSearch=false&showShareIIIFLink=true&showTip=false&helpUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fdoc.lunaimaging.com%2Fdisplay%2FV72D%2FLUNA%2BViewer%23LUNAViewer-LUNAViewer&title=Search+Results%3A+List_No+equal+to+%273362.052%27&fullTextSearchChecked=&advancedSearchUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fdoc.lunaimaging.com%2Fdisplay%2FV72D%2FSearching%23Searching-Searching&thumbnailViewUrlKey=link.view.search.url |title=Map of Chinese Empire (1835)}}</ref> The territory, then known in Russian as "Kirghizia", was formally incorporated into the Empire in 1876. The Russian takeover was met with numerous revolts, and many of the Kyrgyz opted to relocate to the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Afghanistan]].

In addition, the suppression of the [[Urkun|1916 rebellion]] against Russian rule in Central Asia caused many Kyrgyz later to migrate to China.<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/uzbekistan/10.htm Uzbekistan – The Jadidists and Basmachis]". [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].</ref> Since many ethnic groups in the region were (and still are) split between neighboring states at a time when borders were more porous and less regulated, it was common to move back and forth over the mountains, depending on where life was perceived as better; this might mean better rains for pasture or better government during oppression.

===Soviet Kyrgyzstan===
[[File:Bischkek.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bishkek]]]]
Soviet power was initially established in the region in 1919, and the [[Kara-Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast]] was created within the [[Russian SFSR]] (the phrase Kara-Kirghiz was used until the mid-1920s by the Russians to distinguish them from the [[Kazakhs]], who were also referred to as Kirghiz). On 5 December 1936, the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic]] was established as a constituent [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]].

During the 1920s, Kyrgyzstan developed considerably in cultural, educational and social life. Literacy was greatly improved, and a standard literary language was introduced by imposing Russian on the populace. Economic and social development also was notable. Many aspects of the Kyrgyz national culture were retained despite the suppression of nationalist activity under [[Joseph Stalin]].

The early years of [[glasnost]] had little effect on the political climate in Kyrgyzstan. However, the Republic's press was permitted to adopt a more liberal stance and to establish a new publication, ''Literaturny Kirghizstan'', by the Union of Writers. Unofficial political groups were forbidden, but several groups that emerged in 1989 to deal with the acute housing crisis were permitted to function.

According to the last Soviet census in 1989, ethnic Kyrgyz made up only 22% of the residents of the northern city of [[Bishkek|Frunze]] (now Bishkek), while more than 60% were Russians, Ukrainians, and people from other [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] nations. Nearly 10% of the capital's population were Jewish (a rather unique fact, for almost any place in the Soviet Union, except the [[Jewish Autonomous Republic]]).

[[File:Stamps of Kyrgyzstan, 2011-05.jpg|thumb|[[Marco Polo sheep]] on a Kyrgyzstan stamp]]
In June 1990, ethnic tensions between [[Uzbeks]] and Kyrgyz surfaced in the [[Osh Oblast]] (southern Kyrgyzstan), where Uzbeks form a minority of the population.<ref name="conflict">{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=33728 |title=KYRGYZSTAN: Economic disparities driving inter-ethnic conflict |publisher=[[IRIN]] Asia |date=15 February 2006}}</ref> Attempts to appropriate Uzbek [[Collective farming|collective farms]] for housing development triggered the [[Osh riots (1990)|Osh Riots]].

EurasiaNet.org. 24 January 2006.</ref> and [[Askar Akayev]], the youngest of five sons born into a family of collective farm workers (in northern Kyrgyzstan), was elected president in October of that same year.
[[File:Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (44612466662).jpg|thumb|The statue of [[Vladimir Lenin]] in Bishkek]]

By then, the [[Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan Democratic Movement]] (KDM) had developed into a significant political force with support in Parliament. On 15 December 1990, the Supreme Soviet voted to change the republic's name to the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. The following January, Akayev introduced new government structures and appointed a new cabinet composed mainly of younger, reform-oriented politicians. In February 1991, the name of the capital, Frunze, was changed back to its pre-revolutionary name of Bishkek.

Despite these political moves toward independence, economic realities seemed to work against secession from the Soviet Union. In a referendum on the preservation of the Soviet Union in March 1991, 88.7% of the voters approved the proposal to retain the Soviet Union as a "renewed federation". Nevertheless, secessionist forces pushed Kyrgyzstan's independence through in August of that same year.

On 19 August 1991, when the [[State Committee on the State of Emergency|State Emergency Committee]] assumed power in Moscow, there was an attempt to depose Akayev in Kyrgyzstan. After the coup collapsed the following week, Akayev and Vice President [[German Kuznetsov]] announced their resignations from the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU), and the entire bureau and secretariat resigned. This was followed by the Supreme Soviet vote declaring independence from the Soviet Union on 31 August 1991 as the '''Republic of Kyrgyzstan'''. 

===Independence===
{{Recentism|date=September 2012}}
In October 1991, Akayev ran unopposed and was elected president of the new independent Republic by direct ballot, receiving 95 percent of the votes cast. Together with the representatives of seven other Republics that same month, he signed the Treaty of the New Economic Community. Finally, on 21 December 1991, Kyrgyzstan joined with the other four Central Asian Republics to formally enter the new [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Kyrgyzstan gained full independence a few days later on 25 December 1991. The following day, on 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan joined the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). On 5 May 1993, the official name changed from the Republic of Kyrgyzstan to the Kyrgyz Republic.

In 2005, a popular uprising known as the "[[Tulip Revolution]]", took place after the parliamentary elections in March 2005, forced President [[Askar Akayev]]'s resignation on 4 April 2005. Opposition leaders formed a coalition, and a new government was formed under President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] and Prime Minister [[Feliks Kulov]]. The nation's capital was looted during the protests.

Political stability appeared to be elusive, however, as various groups and factions allegedly linked to [[organized crime]] jockeyed for power. Three of the 75 members of Parliament elected in March 2005 were assassinated, and another member was assassinated on 10 May 2006 shortly after winning his murdered brother's seat in a by-election. All four are reputed to have been directly involved in major illegal business ventures.{{According to whom|date=December 2014}}
On 6 April 2010, [[2010 Kyrgyzstan revolution|civil unrest broke out]] in the town of [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]] after a demonstration against government corruption and increased living expenses. The protests became violent,  spreading to Bishkek by the following day. Protesters attacked President Bakiyev's offices, as well as state-run radio and television stations. There were conflicting reports that Interior Minister [[Moldomusa Kongatiyev]] had been beaten. On 7 April 2010, President Bakiyev imposed a state of emergency.

Finding it difficult to control the situation, Otunbayeva, the interim leader, sent a letter to the Russian president, Dimitry Medvedev, asking him to send Russian troops to help the country control the situation. Medvedev's Press Attaché, [[Natalya Timakova]], said in a reply to the letter, "It is an internal conflict and for now Russia does not see the conditions for taking part in its resolution". The clashes caused a shortage of food and other essential commodities with more than 200 killed and 1,685 people hurt, {{As of|2010|06|12|lc=on}}. The Russian government, however, said it would be sending humanitarian aid to the troubled nation.<ref name="By2010">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10300348.stm|title=Kyrgyz president asks for Russian help|publisher=BBC |date= 12 June 2010|accessdate=12 June 2010}}</ref>

According to local sources, there was a clash between two local gangs and it did not take long for the violence to spread to the rest of the city. There were also reports that the armed forces supported ethnic Kyrgyz gangs entering the city, but the government denied the allegations.<ref name="By2010"/>

The riots spread to neighboring areas, and the government declared a state of emergency in the entire southern [[Jalal-Abad]] region. To control the situation, the interim government gave special shoot-to-kill powers to the security forces.

[[Temir Sariyev]], deputy chief of the interim government, said there were local clashes and that it was not possible [for the government] to fully control the situation. He added that there were not sufficient security forces to contain the violence. Media agencies reported on 14 June 2010 that the Russian government was considering a request by the Kyrgyz government. An emergency meeting of [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation]] (CSTO) was held on the same day (14 June) to discuss the role it could play in helping to end the violence.
Ethnic violence waned, according to the Kyrgyz government, by 15 June 2010 and Kyrgyz president Roza Otunbayeva held a news conference that day and declared that there was no need for Russia to send in troops to quell the violence. There were at least 170 people left dead by 15 June 2010 but Pascale Meige Wagner of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] said the [official] death toll was an underestimate. The UN High Commissioner told reporters in [[Geneva]] that evidence suggested that the violence seemed to have been staged up.
Ethnic Uzbeks threatened to blow up an oil depot in Osh if they failed to get guarantees of protection. The United Nations said it believed that the attacks were "orchestrated, targeted and well-planned". Kyrgyz officials told the media that a person suspected to be behind the violence in Jalal-Abad had been detained.<ref name="http">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/asia_pacific/10325589.stm|title=UN and Russian aid arrives |publisher=BBC |date= 16 June 2010 |accessdate=16 June 2010}}</ref>

On 2 August 2010, a Kyrgyz government commission began investigating the causes of the clashes. Members of the National Commission, led by former parliament speaker Abdygany Erkebaev, met with people from the predominantly ethnic Uzbek villages of Mady, Shark, and Kyzyl-Kyshtak in the Kara-Suu district of Osh Oblast. This National Commission, including representatives of many ethnic groups, was established by a presidential decree.

President Roza Otunbayeva also said in August 2010 that an international commission would also be formed to investigate the clashes.<ref>[http://www.rferl.org/content/Kyrgyz_Commission_Begins_Investigating_Ethnic_Clashes/2116620.html Kyrgyz Commission Begins Investigating Ethnic Clashes]. Rferl.org (2 August 2010). Retrieved on 6 December 2013.</ref> The international commission conducted an extensive investigation and prepared a report – The Independent international commission of inquiry into the events in southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010 (KIC) [https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/Full_Report_490.pdf]. It stated that "The Provisional Government, which had assumed power two months before the events, either failed to recognize or underestimated the deterioration in inter-ethnic relations in southern Kyrgyzstan". The KIC concluded that the "Provisional Government had the responsibility to ensure that the security forces were adequately trained and appropriately equipped to deal with situations of civil unrest" but unable to take necessary measures.

Other reports contain a different account. A report, released in January 2011, concluded that the events in southern Kyrgyzstan constituted a “planned, large-scale provocation, oriented towards the splitting of Kyrgyzstan and disrupting the unity of its people.” Responsibility for this provocation was seen as lying with “nationalistically-minded leaders of the Uzbek community”.
In the aftermath of the turmoil, on 5 August 2010, Kyrgyz forces arrested party leader Urmat Baryktabasov on suspicion of plotting an overthrow of the government, after troops allegedly fired blank rounds at a crowd trying to join mass demonstrations near the Parliament in the capital Bishkek. Acting President Roza Otunbayeva said security forces seized firearms and grenades from him and 26 supporters.<ref>Siegel, Matt and Namatabayeva, Tolkun (5 August 2010) [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5itwmskCKICJVZOpvt3Gbs76Z2H9g Attempted coup rocks tense Kyrgyzstan].

The [[1993–2010 Constitution of Kyrgyzstan|1993 constitution]] defines the form of government as a democratic unicameral republic. The executive branch includes a Supreme Chancellor and Vice Chair. The parliament currently is unicameral. The judicial branch comprises a Supreme Court, local courts and a Chief Prosecutor.

[[File:Akayev-Bush.jpg|thumb|President [[Askar Akayev]] (1990–2005) with U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], 22 September 2002]]
In March 2002, in the southern district of [[Aksy]], five people protesting the arbitrary arrest of an opposition politician were shot dead by police, sparking nationwide protests. President [[Askar Akayev]] initiated a constitutional reform process which initially included the participation of a broad range of government, civil and social representatives in an open dialogue, leading to a February 2003 referendum marred by voting irregularities.

[[File:Secretary Kerry Meets With Kyrgyz President Atambaev in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (22454204010).jpg|thumb|President [[Almazbek Atambaev]] (2011–17) on a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]], 31 October 2015]]
The amendments to the constitution approved by the referendum resulted in stronger control by the president and weakened the parliament and the Constitutional Court. Parliamentary elections for a new, 75-seat unicameral legislature were held on 27 February and 13 March 2005, but were widely viewed as corrupt. The subsequent protests led to a bloodless [[coup]] on 24 March 2005, after which Akayev fled the country with his family and was replaced by acting president [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] (see: [[Tulip Revolution]]).

On 10 July 2005, acting president Bakiyev won the [[Kyrgyz presidential election, 2005|presidential election]] in a landslide, with 88.9% of the vote, and was inaugurated on 14 August. However, initial public support for the new administration substantially declined in subsequent months as a result of its apparent inability to solve the corruption problems that had plagued the country since its independence from the Soviet Union, along with the murders of several members of parliament. Large-scale protests against president Bakiyev took place in Bishkek in April and November 2006, with opposition leaders accusing the president of failing to live up to his election promises to reform the country's constitution and transfer many of his presidential powers to parliament.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6124428.stm | title = Clashes erupt in Kyrgyz capital|accessdate = 21 November 2007 |publisher = BBC Online | date=7 November 2006}}</ref>

Kyrgyzstan is also a member of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE), a league of 56 participating states committed to peace, transparency, and the protection of human rights in Eurasia. As an OSCE participating State, Kyrgyzstan's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]].

In December 2008, the state-owned broadcast UTRK announced that it would require prior submission of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] programmes, which UTRK are required to retransmit according to a 2005 agreement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;docid=494b629e1e&amp;skip=0&amp;query=radio%20liberty%20kyrgyzstan |title=Refworld &#124; Demand for prior approval of RFE/RL programmes called "intolerable" |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |date=17 December 2008 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> UTRK had stopped retransmitting RFE/RL programming in October 2008, a week after it failed to broadcast an RFE/RL programme called 'Inconvenient Questions' which covered the October elections, claiming to have lost the missing material. President Bakiyev had criticised this programme in September 2008, while UTRK told RFE/RL that its programming was too negative. [[Reporters Without Borders]], which ranks Kyrgyzstan 111th out of 173 countries on its [[Press Freedom Index]], strongly criticised the decision.

On 3 February 2009, President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] announced the imminent closure of the [[Manas Air Base]], the only US military base remaining in Central Asia.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7868586.stm |title=Proposal to close the Manas Air Base |publisher=BBC News |date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> The closure was approved by Parliament on 19 February 2009 by a vote of 78–1 for the government-backed bill.<ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,496167,00.html Kyrgyz Parliament Approves U.S. base closure].

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Regions of Kyrgyzstan|Districts of Kyrgyzstan}}
Kyrgyzstan is divided into seven [[region]]s (sing. ''[[oblast]]'' (область), pl. ''oblasttar'' (областтар)) administered by appointed governors. The capital, [[Bishkek]], and the second largest city [[Osh]] are administratively [[independent city|independent cities]] (''shaar'') with a status equal to a region.

{{Kyrgyzstan Regions Image Map}}
The regions, and independent cities, are as follows:
# [[Bishkek|City of Bishkek]]
# [[Batken Region|Batken]]
# [[Chuy Region|Chuy]]

{{Main|Geography of Kyrgyzstan}}

Kyrgyzstan is a landlocked country in [[Central Asia]], bordering [[Kazakhstan]], China, [[Tajikistan]] and [[Uzbekistan]]. It lies between latitudes [[39th parallel north|39°]] and [[44th parallel north|44° N]], and longitudes [[69th meridian east|69°]] and [[81st meridian east|81° E]]. It is farther from the sea than any other individual country, and all its rivers flow into [[endorheic basin|closed drainage systems which do not reach the sea]]. The mountainous region of the [[Tian Shan]] covers over 80% of the country (Kyrgyzstan is occasionally referred to as "the Switzerland of Central Asia", as a result),<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Central_Asia/GC26Ag03.html | title = The Tulip Revolution takes root | first = Pepe | last = Escobar| date = 26 March 2005 |publisher = Asia Times Online}}</ref> with the remainder made up of valleys and basins.

[[Issyk-Kul Lake]], or Ysyk-Köl in [[Kyrgyz Language|Kyrgyz]], in the north-eastern Tian Shan is the largest lake in Kyrgyzstan and the second largest mountain lake in the world after [[Titicaca]]. The highest peaks are in the Kakshaal-Too range, forming the Chinese border. Peak [[Jengish Chokusu]], at {{convert|7439|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is the highest point and is considered by geologists to be the northernmost peak over {{convert|7000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the world. Heavy snowfall in winter leads to spring floods which often cause serious damage downstream. The runoff from the mountains is also used for [[hydro-electricity]].

Kyrgyzstan has significant deposits of metals including [[gold]] and [[rare-earth metals]]. Due to the country's predominantly mountainous terrain, less than 8% of the land is cultivated, and this is concentrated in the northern lowlands and the fringes of the [[Fergana Valley]].

[[Bishkek]] in the north is the capital and largest city, with 937,400 inhabitants ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}). The second city is the ancient town of [[Osh]], located in the Fergana Valley near the border with Uzbekistan. The principal river is the [[Kara Darya]], which flows west through the Fergana Valley into Uzbekistan. Across the border in Uzbekistan it meets another major Kyrgyz river, the [[Naryn River|Naryn]].

The confluence forms the [[Syr Darya]], which originally flowed into the [[Aral Sea]]. {{As of|2010}}, it no longer reaches the sea, as its water is withdrawn upstream to irrigate cotton fields in [[Tajikistan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and southern [[Kazakhstan]]. The [[Chu River]] also briefly flows through Kyrgyzstan before entering Kazakhstan.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Kyrgyzstan}}
The climate varies regionally. The low-lying [[Fergana Valley]] in the southwest is [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] and extremely hot in [[summer]], with temperatures reaching {{convert|40|°C}} The northern [[foothill]]s are [[temperate climate|temperate]] and the [[Tian Shan]] varies from dry [[continental climate|continental]] to [[polar climate]], depending on elevation. In the coldest areas temperatures are sub-zero for around 40 days in winter, and even some [[desert]] areas experience constant snowfall in this period. In the lowlands the temperature ranges from around -{{convert|-6|°C|0}} in January to {{convert|24|°C|0}} in July.

===Enclaves and exclaves===
There is one [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]], the tiny village of [[Barak, Kyrgyzstan|Barak]]<ref>[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav060603.shtml# The exclave of Barak, Kyrgyzstan in Uzbekistan]. Retrieved on 2 May 2009</ref> (population 627), in the [[Fergana Valley]]. The village is surrounded by [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] territory. It is located on the road from [[Osh]] (Kyrgyzstan) to Khodjaabad (Uzbekistan) about {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=off}} north-west from the Kyrgyz–Uzbek border in the direction of [[Andijan]].<ref>[http://geosite.jankrogh.com/kyrgyzstan.htm Map showing the location of the Kyrgyz exclave Barak]. Retrieved on 2 May 2009</ref> Barak is administratively part of [[Kara-Suu District]] in Kyrgyzstan's [[Osh Region]].

There are four Uzbek [[enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within Kyrgyzstan. Two of them are the towns of [[Sokh District|Sokh]] (area {{convert|325|km2|abbr=on}} and a population of 42,800 in 1993, although some estimates go as high as 70,000; 99% are [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], the remainder [[Uzbeks]]) and [[Shohimardon|Shakhimardan]] (also known as Shahimardan, Shohimardon, or Shah-i-Mardan, area {{convert|90|km2|abbr=on}} and a population of 5,100 in 1993; 91% are Uzbeks, the remainder [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]]); the other two are the tiny territories of Chong-Kara (roughly {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} wide) and Jangy-ayyl (a dot of land barely {{convert|2|-|3|km|0|abbr=on}} across). Chong-Kara is on the [[Sokh river]], between the Uzbek border and the Sokh enclave. Jangy-ayyl is about {{convert|60|km}} east of [[Batken]], in a northward projection of the Kyrgyz-Uzbek border near [[Khalmion]].

There are also two enclaves belonging to [[Tajikistan]]: [[Vorukh]] (exclave area between {{convert|95|-|130|km2|abbr=on}}, population estimated between 23,000 and 29,000, 95% Tajiks and 5% Kyrgyz, distributed among 17 villages), located {{convert|45|km}} south of [[Isfara]] on the right bank of the Karafshin river, and a small settlement near the Kyrgyz railway station of [[Kairagach]].

== Climate Action ==
Among the countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan is the third most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as changes in weather patterns that could lead to prolonged periods of precipitation and drought.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kabar.kg/eng/news/kyrgyzstan-ranks-third-most-vulnerable-to-climate-change-impacts-in-central-asia/|title=Kyrgyzstan ranks third most vulnerable to climate change impacts in Central Asia|last=President|last2=Parliament|website=Информационное Агентство Кабар|language=en|access-date=14 December 2018|last3=Government|last4=Politics|last5=Economy|last6=Society|last7=Analytics|last8=Regions|last9=Culture}}</ref> Their average temperature has increased from 4.8&nbsp;°C to 6&nbsp;°C so far within the last 20 years.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/kyrgyzstan/press-releases/kyrgyzstan-one-most-vulnerable-countries-climate-change-central-asia|title=Kyrgyzstan is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change in Central Asia|website=www.unicef.org|language=en|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> By 2060, there is an expectation of a 2&nbsp;°C increase in average mean temperature, as well as a 4–5&nbsp;°C increase by 2100.<ref name=":14">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=October 2013|title=Kyrgyz Republic: Overview of Climate Change Activities|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/17548/855610WP0Kyrgy0Box382161B00PUBLIC0.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=World Bank Group}}</ref> Climate change will negatively affect climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture, energy, and forestry.

=== Climate change contributions ===

==== Greenhouse gases ====
About a third of the total greenhouse gas emissions in Kyrgyzstan is due to their main reliance on road systems for transportation.<ref name=":14"/> In 2010, according to data from the World Bank, there were 6,398.9 kilotons of <chem>CO2</chem>emissions released from Kyrgyzstan.<ref name=":14"/> This made up 0.02 percent of the world's <chem>CO2</chem>emissions at the time.<ref name=":14"/> In 2012, Kyrgyzstan emitted 0.03 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Nov 2016|title=Financing Climate Action in Kyrgyzstan|url=https://www.oecd.org/environment/outreach/Kyrgyzstan_Financing_Climate_Action.Nov2016.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}</ref>

The US Energy Information Administration released a data chart ranking countries based on carbon dioxide emissions from energy consumption. In 1992, Kyrgyzstan ranked 82.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2012/jun/21/world-carbon-emissions-league-table-country|title=World carbon emissions: the league table of every country|last=Rogers|first=Simon|date=21 June 2012|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=18 October 2018}}</ref> The most recent data chart, released for 2010, places Kyrgyzstan at rank 129.<ref name=":0" /> By 2030, Kyrgyzstan plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their usual emission levels by between 11.49 percent and 13.75 percent, or by between 29 percent and 31 percent if international support is involved.<ref name=":5" /> By 2050, Kyrgyzstan plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from their usual emission levels by between 12.67 percent and 15.69 percent, or by between 35 percent and 46.75 percent if international support is involved.<ref name=":5" />

=== Climate change impacts ===

==== Agriculture ====
Making up over 40 percent of the country's labor force, the agricultural sector is one of the largest economic sectors for Kyrgyzstan.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=Kyrgyz-Republic-Agricultural-Sector|title=Kyrgyz Republic – Agricultural Sector {{!}} export.gov|website=www.export.gov|language=en|access-date=16 December 2018}}</ref> The majority of the vegetable production is seasonal.<ref name=":3" /> Weather patterns are expected to change during seasonal periods.<ref name=":14"/> The summer months are expected to show a significant reduction in precipitation, whereas the winter months are expected to have the largest increase in precipitation.<ref name=":14"/> Changes to these precipitation patterns will affect what crops will be suitable for production during those periods.<ref name=":14"/> Grazing lands and pastures for livestock production will be affected as the availability of precipitation will determine growth and the ability to regenerate.<ref name=":14"/>

==== Energy sector ====
Glaciers and snow melt are important for filling up rivers that Kyrgyzstan relies on.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/countries_regions/KGZ/KGZ-CP_eng.pdf|title=Kyrgyzstan|last=|first=|date=2012|website=www.fao.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 December 2018}}</ref> Hydro power is the country's main source of energy, making up about 90 percent of electricity generation.<ref name=":14"/> Climate change will cause further complications as hydroelectric generation will not be able to meet peak demand during the winter season.<ref name=":14"/> Hydro power output is expected to decrease as climate change projections suggest that water flow will be reduced from the year 2030 and onward, which will eventually cause energy supply problems.<ref name=":14"/> In regards to energy infrastructure, higher temperatures and extreme weather events may cause significant damages.<ref name=":14"/>

==== Forestry ====
Shifts in ecological zones may cause higher states of plant vulnerability and the inability for certain plant species to adapt to new climate conditions, thus creating the possibility of losing forest resources, such as firewood, fruits, and medicinal herbs.<ref name=":14"/> The walnut forest in Arslanbob allows Kyrgyzstan to be one of the world's largest walnut exporters, but farmers predict that walnut yields may fall up to 70 percent in 2018 due to climate change and soil erosion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurasianet.org/kyrgyzstans-ancient-walnut-forest-living-through-uncertain-times|title=Kyrgyzstan's ancient walnut forest living through uncertain times {{!}} Eurasianet|website=eurasianet.org|access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref>

==== Natural disasters ====
As Kyrgyzstan is situated in a mountainous region, the country is vulnerable to climate-related risks, such as floods, landslides, avalanches, snowstorms, etc.<ref name=":14"/> Climate change is expected to worsen the disasters in action and in damages.<ref name=":14"/> There has been an increased amount of floods and mudslides as, compared to the volume of glaciers in 1960, the volume has reduced by 18 percent in 2000.<ref name=":52">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Nov 2016|title=Financing Climate Action in Kyrgyzstan|url=https://www.oecd.org/environment/outreach/Kyrgyzstan_Financing_Climate_Action.Nov2016.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}</ref> In 2012, from 23 April to the 29th, destructive flash floods affected more than 9,400 people in the Osh, Jalalabad, and Batken regions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2012-000043-kgz|title=Kyrgyzstan: Floods and Mudflows – Apr 2012|website=ReliefWeb|language=en|access-date=16 December 2018}}</ref>

=== Climate action strategies and plans ===

==== Glacier monitoring ====
Kyrgyzstan's geography includes 80 percent of the country being found within the Tian Shan mountain chain, and 4 percent of that is area that is permanently under ice and snow.<ref name=":14"/> More than 8,500 glaciers are in proximal distance to Kyrgyzstan and research has shown that glacier mass has reduced sharply within the past 50 years.<ref name=":14" />

An indicator of atmospheric warming is the amount of glacier mass lost.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.geosci-instrum-method-data-syst.net/6/397/2017/gi-6-397-2017.pdf|title=Re-establishing glacier monitoring in Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, Central Asia|last=Hoelzle|first=Martin|date=2017|journal=Geoscientific Instrumentation|volume=6|issue=2|pages=397|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 December 2018|bibcode=2017GI......6..397H|doi=10.5194/gi-6-397-2017}}</ref> Glacier monitoring was performed on the majority of the glaciers of the Tian Shan mountain chain by the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), however operations have largely ceased to exist after its collapse in the early 1990s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Qiao|last2=Liu|first2=Shiyin|date=2016|title=Response of glacier mass balance to climate change in the Tianshan Mountains during the second half of the twentieth century|doi=10.1007/s00382-015-2585-2|journal=Climate Dynamics|volume=46|issue=1–2|pages=303–316|via=Springer Link|bibcode=2016ClDy...46..303L}}</ref> As of recently, there has been a re-establishment of glacier monitoring sites in Kyrgyzstan with the Abramov glacier, Golubin glacier, Batysh Sook glacier, and Glacier No. 345.<ref name=":4" /> Observations and research over the last five decades show that, overall, the Central Asian glaciers portray more mass loss than mass gain.<ref name=":4" /> From 2000 to 2100, glacial areas are expected to be reduced between 64 and 95 percent.<ref name=":53">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Nov 2016|title=Financing Climate Action in Kyrgyzstan|url=https://www.oecd.org/environment/outreach/Kyrgyzstan_Financing_Climate_Action.Nov2016.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}</ref>

==== Hydro power rehabilitation projects ====
In 2013 and 2014, the energy sector received the largest amount of climate-related development finance.<ref name=":53" /> Rehabilitation projects include: the At Bashy Hydro Power Plant supported by Switzerland and the Toktogul Hydro Power Plant (Phase 2) supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Eurasian Development Bank.<ref name=":53" />

==== Emergency disaster risk management ====
There are five priorities in addressing emergency issues, such as natural disasters, within the adaption program of the Ministry of Emergency Situation:

# Weather forecast and monitoring
# Early warning technologies
# Land zoning and construction norms
# Weather-risk insurance
# Infrastructure development, such as with dam safety.<ref name=":53" />

Supported by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), is the "International Main Roads Improvement Project," which seeks to apply disaster risk reduction measures, such as tunnel construction, and precautions against falling rocks and landslides.<ref name=":53" />

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Kyrgyzstan}}

[[File:Kyrgyzstan Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Kyrgyzstan 's exports]]

Kyrgyzstan is ranked 78th among countries for economic freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/index/country/kyrgyzrepublic|title=Kyrgyz Republic Economy: Population, GDP, Inflation, Business, Trade, FDI, Corruption|website=www.heritage.org}}</ref>

The [[National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic]] serves as the [[Central bank]] of Kyrgyzstan.

Kyrgyzstan was the ninth poorest country in the former [[Soviet Union]], and is today the second poorest country in [[Central Asia]] after Tajikistan. 31.7% of the country's population lives below the poverty line.<ref>{{cite news|title=В 2017 году уровень бедности в Кыргызстане сократится до 31,7% – Всемирный банк|url=http://kabar.kg/news/v-2017-godu-uroven-bednosti-v-kyrgyzstane-sokratitsia-do-31-7-vsemirnyi-bank/|publisher=kabar.kg}}</ref>

Despite the backing of major Western lenders, including the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), the [[World Bank]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]], Kyrgyzstan has had economic difficulties following independence. Initially, these were a result of the breakup of the Soviet trade bloc and resulting loss of markets, which impeded the republic's transition to a demand economy.

The government has reduced expenditures, ended most price subsidies and introduced a [[value-added tax]]. Overall, the government appears committed to the transition to a [[market economy]]. Through economic stabilization and reform, the government seeks to establish a pattern of long-term consistent growth. Reforms led to Kyrgyzstan's accession to the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 20 December 1998.

The Kyrgyz economy was severely affected by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the resulting loss of its vast market. In 1990, some 98% of Kyrgyz exports went to other parts of the Soviet Union. Thus, the nation's economic performance in the early 1990s was worse than any other former Soviet republic except war-torn [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Tajikistan]], as factories and state farms collapsed with the disappearance of their traditional markets in the former Soviet Union. While economic performance has improved considerably in the last few years, and particularly since 1998, difficulties remain in securing adequate [[Fiscal Policy|fiscal]] revenues and providing an adequate [[social safety net]]. [[Remittance]]s of around 800,000 Kyrgyz migrants working in Russia represent 40% of Kyrgyzstan's GDP.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6373KT20100408 |title=Kyrgyz unrest plays into regional rivalry |publisher=Reuters |date=8 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav040309e.shtml |title=Kyrgyzstan: Returning Labor Migrants are a Cause for Concern |publisher=EurasiaNet.org |date=2 April 2009 |access-date=16 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511104050/http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/news/articles/eav040309e.shtml |archive-date=11 May 2011 |dead-url=yes  }}</ref>

[[Agriculture]] is an important sector of the economy in Kyrgyzstan (see [[agriculture in Kyrgyzstan]]). By the early 1990s, the private agricultural sector provided between one-third and one-half of some harvests. In 2002, agriculture accounted for 35.6% of GDP and about half of employment. Kyrgyzstan's terrain is mountainous, which accommodates [[livestock]] raising, the largest agricultural activity, so the resulting [[wool]], [[meat]] and [[dairy product]]s are major commodities. Main crops include [[wheat]], [[sugar beets]], [[potatoes]], [[cotton]], [[tobacco]], [[vegetables]], and [[fruit]]. As the prices of imported [[agrichemicals]] and [[petroleum]] are so high, much farming is being done by hand and by horse, as it was generations ago. Agricultural processing is a key component of the industrial economy as well as one of the most attractive sectors for foreign investment.

Kyrgyzstan is rich in mineral resources but has negligible [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] reserves; it imports petroleum and gas. Among its mineral reserves are substantial deposits of [[coal]], [[gold]], [[uranium]], [[antimony]], and other valuable metals. [[Metallurgy]] is an important industry, and the government hopes to attract foreign investment in this field. The government has actively encouraged foreign involvement in extracting and processing gold from the [[Kumtor Gold Mine]] and other regions. The country's plentiful water resources and mountainous terrain enable it to produce and export large quantities of [[hydroelectric energy]].

The principal exports are nonferrous metals and minerals, woollen goods and other agricultural products, electric energy and certain engineering goods. Imports include petroleum and natural gas, ferrous metals, chemicals, most machinery, wood and paper products, some foods and some construction materials. Its leading trade partners include Germany, Russia, China, [[Kazakhstan]], and [[Uzbekistan]].

In regards to telecommunication infrastructure, Kyrgyz Republic ranks last in Central Asia in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Kyrgyz Republic ranked number 118 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, unchanged from 2013 (see [[Networked Readiness Index]]).

{{Main|Demographics of Kyrgyzstan}}

Kyrgyzstan's population is estimated at 5.6 million in 2013.<ref name=census>{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.kg/stat.files/din.files/census/5010003.pdf |title=Ethnic composition of the population in Kyrgyzstan 1999–2014 |publisher=National Statistical Committee of the Kyrgyz Republic |accessdate=14 April 2014 |language=ru |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706220049/http://www.stat.kg/stat.files/din.files/census/5010003.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2014 }}</ref> Of those, 34.4% are under the age of 15 and 6.2% are over 65. The country is [[rural]]: only about one-third of the population live in urban areas. The average [[population density]] is 25 people per km².

=== Ethnic groups ===
The nation's largest [[ethnic group]] are the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] people, who comprise 73.2% of the population. Other ethnic groups include [[Russians]] (5.8%) concentrated in the north and [[Uzbeks]] (14.6%) living in the south. Small but noticeable minorities include [[Dungans]] (1.1%), [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]] (1.1%), [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] (1.1%), [[Kazakhs]] (0.7%), and [[Ukrainians]] (0.5%) and other smaller ethnic minorities (1.7%).<ref name="autogenerated2"/> The country has over 80 ethnic groups.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/10_Things_You_Need_To_Know_About_The_Ethnic_Unrest_In_Kyrgyzstan/2071323.html |title=10 Things You Need To Know About The Ethnic Unrest In Kyrgyzstan |publisher=RFERL |date=14 June 2010}}</ref>

The Kyrgyz have historically been semi-[[nomad]]ic herders, living in round tents called [[yurt]]s and tending [[sheep]], [[horse]]s and [[yak]]s. This nomadic tradition continues to function seasonally (see [[transhumance]]) as herding families return to the high mountain pasture (or ''jailoo'') in the summer. The sedentary Uzbeks and Tajiks traditionally have farmed lower-lying irrigated land in the [[Fergana valley]].<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/kyrgyzstan/13.htm Kyrgyzstan – population]".

===Languages===
{{main|languages of Kyrgyzstan}}
Kyrgyzstan is one of two former Soviet republics in Central Asia to have Russian as an [[official language]], [[Kazakhstan]] being the other. The [[Kyrgyz language]] was adopted as the official language in 1991. After pressure from the Russian minority in the country, Kyrgyzstan adopted Russian as an official language as well in 1997, to become an officially bilingual country.

[[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]] is a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language of the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] branch, closely related to [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], and [[Nogay language|Nogay Tatar]]. It was written in the [[Arabic alphabet]] until the twentieth century. [[Latin alphabet|Latin script]] was introduced and adopted in 1928, and was subsequently replaced on Stalin's orders by [[Cyrillic script#Kyrgyz|Cyrillic script]] in 1941.

According to the 2009 census,<ref>{{cite web|title=Перепись населения и жилищного фонда Кыргызской Республики (Population and Housing Census of the Kyrgyz Republic), 2009 |url=http://212.42.101.100:8088/nacstat/node/23 |publisher=NSC of Kyrgyzstan |accessdate=9 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121143551/http://212.42.101.100:8088/nacstat/node/23 |archivedate=21 January 2013 }}</ref> 4.1 million people spoke Kyrgyz as native or second language and 2.5 million spoke Russian as native or second language. Uzbek is the second most widely spoken native language, followed by Russian. Russian is the most widely spoken second language, followed by Kyrgyz and Uzbek.

Many business and political affairs are carried out in Russian. Until recently, Kyrgyz remained a language spoken at home and was rarely used during meetings or other events. However, most parliamentary meetings today are conducted in Kyrgyz, with simultaneous interpretation available for those not speaking Kyrgyz.

[[Islam]] is the dominant religion of Kyrgyzstan: 80% of the population is NDM ([[Non-denominational Muslim]])<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.asmi.edu.kg/about-kyrgyzstan | title=About Kyrgyzstan|publisher=S.Tentishev Memorial Asian Medical Institute }}</ref>{{unreliable source|date=January 2019}} while 17% follow [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]] and 3% other religions.<ref name="Kyrgyzstan">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5598.htm |title=Kyrgyzstan |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref> A 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] report indicates a higher percentage of Muslims, with 86.3% of Kyrgyzstan's population adhering to Islam.<ref>[http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf MAPPING THE GLOBAL MUSLIM POPULATION].

During Soviet times, [[state atheism]] was encouraged. Today, however, Kyrgyzstan is a [[secular state]], although Islam has exerted a growing influence in politics.<ref name=isn>{{cite web|url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/news/sw/details.cfm?ID=18147 |title=ISN Security Watch – Islam exerts growing influence on Kyrgyz politics |publisher=Isn.ethz.ch |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> For instance, there has been an attempt to arrange for officials to travel on ''[[hajj]]'' (the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]) under a tax-free arrangement.

While [[Islam in Kyrgyzstan]] is more of a cultural background than a devout daily practice for many, public figures have expressed support for restoring religious values. For example, [[human rights]] [[ombudsman]] Tursunbay Bakir-Ulu noted, "In this era of independence, it is not surprising that there has been a return to spiritual roots not only in Kyrgyzstan, but also in other post-communist republics. It would be immoral to develop a market-based society without an ethical dimension."<ref name=isn/>
[[File:Bishkek church 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bishkek [[Orthodox Church]]]]

The other faiths practiced in Kyrgyzstan include [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] and [[Orthodox Church of Ukraine|Ukrainian Orthodox]] versions of [[Christianity]], practiced primarily by [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]] respectively. A community of 5000 to 10000 Jehovah's Witnesses gather in both Kirghiz- and Russian-speaking congregations, as well as some Chinese- and Turkish-speaking groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jw.org/en/publications/books/?contentLanguageFilter=en&pubFilter=yb15&sortBy=1 |title=2015 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses|page=182 |publisher=Watchtower Bible & Tract Society |date=21 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jw.org/en/jehovahs-witnesses/meetings/ |title=Congregation Meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses |publisher=Watchtower Bible & Tract Society |date=21 December 2015}}</ref> A small minority of ethnic Germans are also Christian, mostly [[Lutheran Church|Lutheran]] and [[Anabaptist]] as well as a [[Roman Catholic]] community of approximately 600.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-28637?l=spanish |title=Kirguistán la Iglesia renace con 600 católicos |publisher=ZENIT |date=2 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007173444/http://www.zenit.org/article-28637?l=spanish |archivedate= 7 October 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://asia.msu.edu/centralasia/Kyrgyzstan/religion.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702212941/http://asia.msu.edu/centralasia/Kyrgyzstan/religion.html |archivedate= 2 July 2007 |title=Religion in Kyrgyzstan |publisher=Asia.msu.edu |date=4 March 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

A few [[Animism|Animistic]] traditions survive, as do influences from [[Buddhism]] such as the tying of [[prayer flag]]s onto sacred trees, though some view this practice rooted within [[Sufi]] Islam.<ref>''[[Shaikh]] Muhammad Bin Jamil Zeno'', [[Muhammad Bin Jamil Zeno]], 2006, pg. 264</ref> There are also a small number of [[Bukharian Jews]] living in Kyrgyzstan, but during the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] most fled to other countries, mainly the United States and [[Israel]]. In addition, there is a small community of [[Ashkenazi Jews]], who fled to the country from eastern Europe during the [[Second World War]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://students.sras.org/jewish-bishkek-a-brief-history-and-guide/|title=Jewish Bishkek: A Brief History and Guide|date=3 February 2015|access-date=17 October 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017093905/http://students.sras.org/jewish-bishkek-a-brief-history-and-guide/|archive-date=17 October 2017|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

On 6 November 2008, the Kyrgyzstan parliament unanimously passed a law increasing the minimum number of adherents for recognizing a religion from 10 to 200. It also outlawed "aggressive action aimed at [[proselytism]]", and banned religious activity in schools and all activity by unregistered organizations. It was signed by President [[Kurmanbek Bakiyev]] on 12 January 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav011609c.shtml |title=Human Rights Activists Condemn New Religion Law |publisher=Eurasianet.org |date=16 January 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429065320/http://eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav011609c.shtml |archive-date=29 April 2009 |dead-url=yes  }}</ref>

===Traditions===
In addition to celebrating the [[New Year]] each 1 January, the Kyrgyz observe the traditional New Year festival [[Nowruz]] on the vernal equinox. This spring holiday is celebrated with feasts and festivities such as the horse game [[Buzkashi|Ulak Tartish]].

Illegal, but still practiced, is the tradition of [[bride kidnapping]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/kyrgyzstan/thestory.html | title = Synopsis of ''"The Kidnapped Bride"'' | first = Petr | last = Lom| date = March 2004 | publisher = Frontline/World}}</ref>

It is debatable whether bride kidnapping is actually traditional. Some of the confusion may stem from the fact that [[arranged marriage]]s were traditional, and one of the ways to escape an arranged marriage was to arrange a consensual "kidnapping."<ref>[http://pantheon.hrw.org/reports/2006/kyrgyzstan0906/ "Reconciled to Violence: State Failure to Stop Domestic Abuse and Abduction of Women in Kyrgyzstan"]. ''Human Rights Watch Report''. September 2006, Vol. 18, No.9.</ref>

===Flag===
The 40-rayed yellow sun in the center of the flag represent the 40 tribes that once made up the entirety of Kyrgyz culture before the intervention of Russia during the rise of the Soviet Union. The lines inside the sun represent the crown or tündük (Kyrgyz түндүк) of a yurt, a symbol replicated in many facets of Kyrgyz architecture. The red portion of the flag represents peace and openness of Kyrgyzstan.

Under Soviet rule and before 1992, it had the [[flag of the Soviet Union]] with two big blue stripes and a white thin stripe in the middle.

===Horse riding===
The traditional national sports reflect the importance of [[horse riding]] in Kyrgyz culture.

Very popular, as in all of Central Asia, is ''[[Buzkashi|Ulak Tartysh]]'', a [[team sports|team game]] resembling a cross between [[polo]] and [[rugby football|rugby]] in which two teams of riders wrestle for possession of the headless carcass of a goat, which they attempt to deliver across the opposition's goal line, or into the opposition's goal: a big tub or a circle marked on the ground.

Other popular games on horseback include:
* ''At Chabysh'' – a long-distance horse race, sometimes over a distance of more than 50&nbsp;km
* ''Jumby Atmai'' – a large bar of precious metal (the "jumby") is tied to a pole by a thread and contestants attempt to break the thread by shooting at it, while at a gallop
* ''[[Kyz Kuumai]]'' – a man chases a girl in order to win a kiss from her, while she gallops away; if he is not successful she may in turn chase him and attempt to beat him with her "kamchi" (horsewhip)
* ''Oodarysh'' – two contestants wrestle on horseback, each attempting to be the first to throw the other from his horse
* ''Tyin Emmei'' – picking up a coin from the ground at full gallop

===Tourism===
{{Advert section|date=May 2018}}

One of the most popular tourist destination points in Kyrgyzstan is [[Issyk Kul Lake]]. Numerous hotels, resorts and boarding houses are located along its northern shore. The most popular beach zones are in the city of [[Cholpon-Ata]] and the settlements nearby, such as Kara-Oi (Dolinka), Bosteri and Korumdy. The number of tourists visiting the lake was more than a million a year in 2006 and 2007. However, due to the economical and political instability in the region, the number has declined in recent years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Issyk-Kul: Chasing short-term profit |url=http://www.neweurasia.net/business-and-economics/issyk-kul-chasing-short-term-profit/ |publisher=New Eurasia |accessdate=3 May 2011}}</ref>

Some of the most popular locations for camping are southern Osh, the area between Naryn City and the Torugart pass, and the mountains and glaciers surrounding Karakol in Issyk-Kul.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Local guides and porters can be hired from many tour companies in Bishkek and in the regional capitals.

Skiing is still in its infancy as a tourism industry. The ski base of Toguz Bulak is {{convert|45|km|0|abbr=on}} from Bishkek, on the way to Issyk Ata valley. In the Karakol Valley National Park, outside Karakol.

===Sports===

[[File:Bandy 2012. KYR - JPN.JPG|thumb|right|Bandy: Kyrgyzstan in red against Japan]]
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Kyrgyzstan. The official governing body is the [[Football Federation of Kyrgyz Republic]], which was founded in 1992, after the split of the [[Soviet Union]]. It administers the [[Kyrgyzstan national football team]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kyrgyzstan|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=kgz/index.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=3 May 2011}}</ref>

[[Wrestling]] is also very popular. In the [[2008 Summer Olympic Games]], two athletes from Kyrgyzstan won medals in [[Greco-Roman wrestling]]: [[Kanatbek Begaliev]] (silver) and [[Ruslan Tyumenbayev]] (bronze).<ref>{{cite news|title=Kyrgyzstan Olympic Medals|url=http://content.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/beijing/medals.aspx?cc=KGZ|publisher=USATODAY|accessdate=3 May 2011|date=16 September 2008}}</ref>

[[Ice hockey]] was not as popular in Kyrgyzstan until the first [[Kyrgyzstan Championship (ice hockey)|Ice Hockey Championship]] was organized in 2009. In 2011, the [[Kyrgyzstan men's national ice hockey team]] won [[2011 Asian Winter Games]] Premier Division dominating in all six games with six wins. It was the first major international event that Kyrgyzstan's ice hockey team took part in.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lundqvist|first=Henrik|title=Kyrgyzstan wins the Asian Winter Games Premier Division 2011|url=http://www.eurohockey.com/article/259-kyrgyzstan-wins-the-asian-winter-games-premier-division-2011.html|publisher=EuroHockey|date=5 February 2011}}</ref> The Kyrgyzstan men's ice hockey team joined the [[IIHF]] in July 2011.

[[Bandy]] is becoming increasingly popular in the country. The Kyrgyz national team took Kyrgyzstan's first medal at the [[Asian Winter Games]], when they captured the bronze. They played in the [[Bandy World Championship 2012]], their first appearance in that tournament.<ref>[http://www.bandy.or.jp/_userdata/teampictureFeb2.jpg Team picture with Japan after their first meeting in the World Championships]. bandy.or.jp.</ref>

===Science and technology===
The headquarters of the Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences is located in Bishkek, where several research institutes are located. Kyrgyz researchers are developing useful technologies based on natural products, such as heavy metal remediation for purifying waste water.<ref name="Yurishcheva">{{cite journal |doi=10.4024/36FR12A.jbpc.13.02|title=Sorption of Pb<sup>2+</sup> by magnetite coated with humic acids|journal=J.

==Education==

The school system in Kyrgyzstan includes primary (grades 1 to 4) and secondary (grades 5 to 11 (or sometimes 12)) divisions within one school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.gdc/cntrystd.kz|title=Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan : country studies|last=Curtis|first=Glenn E.|date=1997|website=Library of Congress|publisher=Library of Congress, Federal Research Division|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070316011121/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/kztoc.html|archive-date=16 March 2007|dead-url=yes|access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref> Children are usually accepted to primary schools at the age of 7. It is required that every child finishes 9 grades of school and receives a certificate of completion. Grades 10–11 are optional, but it is necessary to complete them to graduate and receive a state-accredited school diploma. To graduate, a student must complete the 11-year school course and pass 4 mandatory state exams in writing, maths, history and a foreign language.

There are 77 public schools in Bishkek (capital city) and more than 200 in the rest of the country. There are 55 higher educational institutions and universities in Kyrgyzstan, out of which 37 are state institutions.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In September 2016, the [[University of Central Asia]] was launched in Naryn, Kyrgyzstan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucentralasia.org |title=University of Central Asia – University of Central Asia |publisher=Ucentralasia.org |date=14 September 2018 |accessdate=}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:E8102-Bishkek-West-Bus-Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|Bishkek West Bus Terminal]]
{{Main|Transport in Kyrgyzstan}}
Transport in Kyrgyzstan is severely constrained by the country's alpine topography. Roads have to snake up steep valleys, cross passes of {{convert|3000|m|ft}} altitude and more, and are subject to frequent mudslides and snow avalanches. Winter travel is close to impossible in many of the more remote and high-altitude regions.

Additional problems come from the fact that many roads and railway lines built during the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period are today intersected by international boundaries, requiring time-consuming border formalities to cross where they are not completely closed. [[Horse]]s are still a much-used transport option, especially in more rural areas; Kyrgyzstan's road infrastructure is not extensive, so horses are able to reach locations that motor vehicles cannot, and they do not require expensive, imported [[fuel]].

===Airports===
At the end of the Soviet period there were about 50 airports and airstrips in Kyrgyzstan, many of them built primarily to serve military purposes in this border region so close to China. Only a few of them remain in service today. The [[Kyrgyzstan Air Company]] provides air transport to China, Russia, and other local countries.
* [[Manas International Airport]] near [[Bishkek]] is the main international airport, with services to Moscow, [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], [[Urumqi]], [[Istanbul]], [[Baku]], and [[Dubai]].
* [[Osh Airport]] is the main air terminal in the south of the country, with daily connections to Bishkek.
* [[Jalal-Abad Airport]] is linked to Bishkek by daily flights. The national flag carrier, Kyrgyzstan, operates flights on [[BAe-146]] aircraft. During the summer months, a weekly flight links Jalal-Abad with the Issyk-Kul Region.
* Other facilities built during the Soviet era are either closed down, used only occasionally or restricted to military use (e.g., [[Kant Air Base]] near Bishkek, which is used by the [[Russian Air Force]]).

===Banned airline status===
Kyrgyzstan appears on the European Union's [[List of air carriers banned in the European Union|list of prohibited countries for the certification of airlines]]. This means that no airline which is registered in Kyrgyzstan may operate services of any kind within the European Union, due to safety standards which fail to meet European regulations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:102:0003:0016:EN:PDF |title=List of banned E.U. air carriers |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

===Railways===
The [[Chuy Valley]] in the north and the [[Ferghana valley]] in the south were endpoints of the [[Soviet Union]]'s rail system in Central Asia. Following the emergence of independent post-Soviet states, the rail lines which were built without regard for administrative boundaries have been cut by borders, and traffic is therefore severely curtailed. The small bits of rail lines within Kyrgyzstan, about {{convert|370|km|0|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1520|mm|1|abbr=on}} broad gauge) in total, have little economic value in the absence of the former bulk traffic over long distances to and from such centres as [[Tashkent]], [[Almaty]], and the cities of Russia.

There are vague plans about extending rail lines from [[Balykchy]] in the north and/or from [[Osh]] in the south into China, but the cost of construction would be enormous.

====Rail links with adjacent countries====
* [[Transport in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] – yes – [[Bishkek]] branch – same gauge
* [[Transport in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]] – yes – [[Osh]] branch – same gauge
* [[Transport in Tajikistan|Tajikistan]] – no – same gauge
* [[Transport in the People's Republic of China|China]] – no – [[Break of gauge]] 1524&nbsp;mm/1435&nbsp;mm

===Highways===
[[File:Osh 03-2016 img07 Gapar Aitiev Street.jpg|thumb|Street scene in [[Osh]].]]
With support from the [[Asian Development Bank]], a major road linking the north and southwest from [[Bishkek]] to [[Osh]] has recently been completed. This considerably eases communication between the two major population centres of the country—the [[Chuy Valley]] in the north and the [[Fergana Valley]] in the South. An offshoot of this road branches off across a 3,500 meter [[mountain pass|pass]] into the [[Talas Valley]] in the northwest. Plans are now being formulated to build a major road from Osh into China.
* ''total:'' {{convert|34000|km|0|abbr=on}} (including {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=on}} of expressways)
* ''paved:'' {{convert|22600|km|0|abbr=on}} (includes some all-weather gravel-surfaced roads)
* ''unpaved:'' {{convert|7700|km|0|abbr=on}} (these roads are made of unstabilized earth and are difficult to negotiate in wet weather) (1990)

===Waterways===
Water transport exists only on [[Issyk Kul Lake]], and has drastically shrunk since the end of the Soviet Union.

===Ports and harbours===
[[Balykchy]] (Ysyk-Kol or Rybach'ye), on Issyk Kul Lake.

China emerged as one of the world's [[Cradle of civilization|earliest civilizations]], in the fertile basin of the [[Yellow River]] in the [[North China Plain]]. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, or [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-legendary [[Xia dynasty]] in 21st century [[Common Era|BCE]].<ref>[[Xia–Shang–Zhou Chronology Project]] by People's Republic of China</ref> Since then, China has [[Dynasties in Chinese history|expanded, fractured, and re-unified]] numerous times. In the 3rd century BCE, [[Qin's wars of unification|the Qin reunited core China]] and established [[Qin dynasty|the first Chinese empire]]. The succeeding [[Han dynasty]], which ruled from 206 BC until 220 AD, saw some of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most advanced technology]] at that time, including [[papermaking]] and the [[compass]],<ref>Tom (1989), 99; Day & McNeil (1996), 122; Needham (1986e), 1–2, 40–41, 122–123, 228.</ref> along with agricultural and medical improvements. The invention of [[gunpowder]] and [[movable type]] in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) and [[Northern Song]] (960–1127) completed the [[Four Great Inventions]]. Tang culture spread widely in [[Asia]], as the new [[Silk Road|Silk Route]] brought traders to as far as [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bowman|first=John S.|title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=104–105}}</ref> Dynastic rule ended in 1912 with the [[Xinhai Revolution]], when a [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|republic]] replaced the [[Qing dynasty]]. The [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in a division of territory in 1949, when the [[Communist Party of China]] established the People's Republic of China, a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[sovereign state]] on [[Mainland China]], while the [[Kuomintang]]-led government retreated to the island of [[Taiwan]]. The [[political status of Taiwan]] remains disputed.

The Shang was conquered by the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries&nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou, no longer fully obeyed the Zhou king and continually waged war with each other in the 300-year [[Spring and Autumn period]].

In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]]. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu [[Qing dynasty]], then allied with Ming dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]], overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun dynasty]] and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.

The Qing dynasty also began experiencing [[Timeline of late anti-Qing rebellions|internal unrest]] in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the [[White Lotus Rebellion]], the failed [[Taiping Rebellion]] that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the [[Dungan Revolt (1862–77)|Dungan Revolt]] (1862–77) in the northwest. The initial success of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.

In the 19th century, the great [[Chinese emigration|Chinese diaspora]] began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the [[Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–79]], in which between 9 and 13 million people died.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U8480E/U8480E05.htm "Dimensions of need – People and populations at risk"]. 1995.

China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert]]s in the arid north to [[subtropical]] forests in the wetter south. The [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separate China from much of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Central Asia]]. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is {{convert|14500|km|mi|sp=us}} long and is bounded by the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], [[East China Sea|East China]] and [[South China Sea|South China]] seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the [[Eurasian Steppe]] which has been an artery of communication between East and West since the Neolithic through the [[Steppe Route|Steppe route]] – the ancestor of the terrestrial [[Silk Road UNESCO World Heritage Sites|Silk Road]](s).

The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mount Everest]] (8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 April 2010}}</ref> The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Lowest Places on Earth|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/lowest-places-on-earth.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref>

China's climate is mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Regional Climate Studies of China|year=2008|publisher=Springer|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEO_RyNDJ0gC&pg=PA1|isbn=978-3-540-79242-0}}</ref> The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex [[topography]].

In China, heavy metals also cause environmental pollution. Heavy metal pollution is an inorganic chemical hazard, which is mainly caused by lead (Pb), chromium (Cr), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), cobalt (Co), and nickel (Ni). Five metals among them, Pb, Cr, As, Cd, and Hg, are the key heavy metal pollutants in China. Heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining, sewage irrigation, the manufacturing of metal-containing products, and other related production activities. High level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities, including reading and learning disabilities, behavioral problems, hearing loss, attention problems, and disruption in the development of visual and motor function. According to the data of a national census of pollution, China has more than 1.5 million sites of heavy metals exposure. The total volume of discharged heavy metals in the waste water, waste gas and solid wastes are around 900,000 tons each year from 2005–2011.<ref>Hu, Hui, Qian Jin, and Philip Kavan.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of China|Districts of Hong Kong|Municipalities of Macau}}
The People's Republic of China is divided into 22 [[Provinces of China|provinces]], five [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]], each with a designated minority group; four [[Direct-controlled municipality of China|municipalities]]; and two [[special administrative region]]s (SARs) which enjoy a degree of political autonomy. These 31 provincial-level divisions can be collectively referred to as "[[mainland China]]", a term which usually excludes two SARs of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions can be grouped into six regions, including [[North China]], [[Northeast China]], [[East China]], [[South Central China]], [[Southwest China]] and [[Northwest China]].

China considers [[Taiwan]] to be [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|its 23rd province]], although Taiwan is governed by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]], which rejects the PRC's claim.<ref name="Ref_ap">Gwillim Law (2 April 2005). [http://www.statoids.com/ucn.html Provinces of China]. Retrieved 15 April 2006.</ref> None of the divisions are recognized by the ROC government, which claims the entirety of the PRC's territory.

====Trade relations====
In recent decades, China has played an increasing role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbours. China became a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) on 11 December 2001. In 2004, it proposed an entirely new [[East Asia Summit]] (EAS) framework as a forum for regional security issues.<ref name="Ref_s">Dillon, Dana; and Tkacik, John, Jr.; [https://web.archive.org/web/20060210135228/http://www.policyreview.org/134/dillon.html ''China's Quest for Asia''].

China is also a founding member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organization]] (SCO), along with Russia and the Central Asian republics.

China has had a long and complex trade relationship with the United States. In 2000, the [[United States Congress]] approved "permanent normal trade relations" (PNTR) with China, allowing Chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries.<ref>{{cite news|title=Clinton signs China trade bill|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/|publisher=CNN|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505165947/http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/10/clinton.pntr/|archivedate=5 May 2009|date=10 October 2000}}</ref> China has a significant [[trade surplus]] with the United States, its most important export market.<ref name="Ref_w">"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11544677 US trade gap widens on increased Chinese imports]".

[[File:China administrative.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Map depicting territorial disputes between the PRC and neighbouring states. For a larger map, [[Template:PRC provinces big imagemap|see here]].]]
Ever since its establishment after the second [[Chinese Civil War]], the PRC has claimed [[Free area of the Republic of China|the territories]] governed by the [[Republic of China]] (ROC), a separate political entity today commonly known as Taiwan, as a part of its territory. It regards the [[island of Taiwan]] as its [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China|Taiwan Province]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]] as a part of [[Fujian Province]] and islands the ROC controls in the [[South China Sea]] as a part of [[Hainan Province]] and [[Guangdong Province]]. These claims are controversial because of the complicated [[Cross-Strait relations]], with the PRC treating the [[One-China policy]] as one of its most important diplomatic principles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History7320.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912132339/http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History7320.html|archivedate=12 September 2013|title=Chinese Civil War|publisher=Cultural-China.com|quote=To this day, since no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended.|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref>

In addition to Taiwan, China is also involved in other international territorial disputes. Since the 1990s, China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, including a [[Sino-Indian border dispute|disputed border with India]] and an undefined border with [[Bhutan]].

In 2019 a world-first study  called for the mass retraction of more than 400 scientific papers on [[Organ transplantation in China|organ transplantation]], because of fears the organs were obtained unethically from Chinese prisoners.

While the government says 10,000 transplants occur each year, hospital data shows between 60,000 to 100,000 organs are transplanted each year.

===Economic history and growth===
{{Main|Economic history of China (1949–present)}}

From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]]. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move towards a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Agricultural collectivization]] was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs). Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership,<ref name="english.eastday">{{cite web|url=http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909205947/http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 9 September 2009 |title=China is already a market economy—Long Yongtu, Secretary General of Boao Forum for Asia |publisher=EastDay.com |year=2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009 |df= }}</ref> and is one of the leading examples of [[state capitalism]].<ref>[https://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ "Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives"].

China ranks 28th out of 140 countries in the [[Global Competitiveness Index]], above many advanced economies and making it by far the most competitive major emerging economy. This is largely owing to its strength in infrastructure and wide adoption of communication and information technology. However, it lags behind advanced economies in labour market efficiency, institutional strength, and openness of market competition, especially for foreign players attempting to enter the domestic market.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Global Competitiveness Report 2018 |url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GCR2018/05FullReport/TheGlobalCompetitivenessReport2018.pdf |work=World Economic Forum |pages=27}}</ref> In 2018, ''Fortune'''s [[Fortune Global 500|Global 500]] list of the world's largest corporations included [[List of largest Chinese companies|120 Chinese companies]].<ref name=Fortune500>{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/global500/|title=Global 500|year=2014|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref> Many of the largest [[public companies]] in the world were Chinese, including the [[list of largest banks|world's largest bank by total assets]], the [[Industrial and Commercial Bank of China]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/liyanchen/2014/05/07/the-worlds-largest-companies-china-takes-over-the-top-three-spots/|title=The World's Largest Companies: China Takes Over The Top Three Spots|work=[[Forbes]]|date=7 May 2014|accessdate=27 January 2015}}</ref>

Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid 1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a "1.5"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015 (ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits). The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.<ref>{{cite news|title=China formalizes easing of one-child policy|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/12/28/china-one-child-policy/4230785/|newspaper=USA Today|date=28 December 2013}}</ref> In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a [[two-child policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2015-12/27/c_134955448.htm|title=Top legislature amends law to allow all couples to have two children|publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]]| date=27 December 2015}}</ref> Data from the 2010 census implies that the [[total fertility rate]] may be around 1.4, although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1.5–1.6.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18651512 |title=The most surprising demographic crisis |work=The Economist  |date=5 May 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}</ref>

Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]] and conservative philosophies.

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as "regressive and harmful" or "vestiges of [[feudalism]]".

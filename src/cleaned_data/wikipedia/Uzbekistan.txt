The [[sovereign state]] is a [[secular]], [[unitary state|unitary]] constitutional republic, comprising 12 provinces, one autonomous republic, and a capital city. Uzbekistan is bordered by five landlocked countries: [[Kazakhstan]] to the north; [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the northeast; [[Tajikistan]] to the southeast; [[Afghanistan]] to the south; and [[Turkmenistan]] to the southwest. Along with [[Liechtenstein]], it is one of the world's only two [[Landlocked_country#Doubly_landlocked|doubly landlocked countries]] (i.e. sharing borders only with other landlocked countries).

What is now Uzbekistan was in ancient times part of the [[Iranian languages|Iranian]]-speaking region of [[Transoxiana]] and [[Turan]]. The first recorded settlers were Eastern Iranian nomads, known as [[Scythians]], who founded kingdoms in [[Khwarezm]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Bactria]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Sogdia]] (8th–6th centuries BC), [[Kingdom of Fergana|Fergana]] (3rd century BC – 6th century AD), and [[Margiana]] (3rd century BC – 6th century AD). The area was incorporated into the [[Achaemenids|Persian Empire]] and, after a period of [[Baktria|Macedonian Greek rule]], was ruled by the Persian [[Parthian Empire]] and later by the [[Sasanian Empire]], until the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the 7th century. The [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim conquest]] in the 7th century converted the majority of the population, including the local ruling classes, into adherents of [[Islam]]. During this period, cities such as Samarkand, Khiva and Bukhara began to grow rich from the [[Silk Road]]. The local [[Khwarezmian dynasty]], and Central Asia as a whole, were decimated by the [[Mongol conquest of Khwarezmia|Mongol invasion]] in the 13th century. After the Mongol Conquests, the area became increasingly dominated by Turkic peoples. The city of [[Shahrisabz]] was the birthplace of the Turco-Mongol warlord [[Timur]], also known as one of [[Genghis Khan]]'s grandchildren, who in the 14th century established the [[Timurid Empire]] and was proclaimed the Supreme Emir of [[Turan]] with his capital in [[Samarkand]]. The area was conquered by [[Shaybanids|Uzbek Shaybanids]] in the 16th century, moving the centre of power from Samarkand to [[Bukhara]]. The region was split into three states: [[Khanate of Khiva]], [[Khanate of Kokand]], and [[Emirate of Bukhara]]. It [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|was gradually incorporated]] into the [[Russian Empire]] during the 19th century, with [[Tashkent]] becoming the political center of [[Russian Turkestan]]. In 1924, after [[national delimitation in the Soviet Union#National delimitation in Central Asia|national delimitation]], the constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]] known as the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]] was created. Following the [[breakup of the Soviet Union]], it declared independence as the Republic of Uzbekistan on 31 August 1991.

Uzbekistan has a diverse cultural heritage due to its storied history and strategic location. Its first major official language is [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], a Turkic language written in the [[Latin alphabet]] and spoken natively by approximately 85% of the population. [[Russian language|Russian]] has widespread use as a governmental language; it is the most widely taught second language. [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]] constitute 81% of the population, followed by [[Russian people|Russians]] (5.4%), Tajiks (4.0%), Kazakhs (3.0%), and others (6.5%). [[Muslims]]&nbsp;constitute 79% of the population while 5% of the population follow&nbsp;[[Russian Orthodox|Russian Orthodox Christianity]], and 16% of the population follow other religions or are non-religious. A majority of Uzbeks are [[non-denominational Muslim]]s.<ref>"Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation". The World’s Muslims: Unity and Diversity.

In September 2017, the country's currency became fully convertible in the market rates. Uzbekistan is a major producer and exporter of [[cotton]].

Uzbekistan lies between latitudes [[37th parallel north|37°]] and [[46th parallel north|46° N]], and longitudes [[56th meridian east|56°]] and [[74th meridian east|74° E]]. It stretches {{convert|1425|km|mi}} from west to east and {{convert|930|km|mi}} from north to south. Bordering [[Kazakhstan]] and the [[Aralkum Desert]] (former [[Aral Sea]]) to the north and northwest, [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Afghanistan]] to the southwest, [[Tajikistan]] to the southeast, and [[Kyrgyzstan]] to the northeast, Uzbekistan is one of the largest [[Central Asian]] states and the only Central Asian state to border all the other four. Uzbekistan also shares a short border (less than {{convert|150|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) with [[Afghanistan]] to the south.

Uzbekistan is a dry, [[landlocked]] country. It is one of two [[doubly landlocked]] countries in the world (that is, a country completely surrounded by landlocked countries), the other being [[Liechtenstein]]. In addition, due to its location within a series of [[endorheic]] basins, none of its rivers lead to the sea. Less than 10% of its territory is intensively cultivated irrigated land in river valleys and oases. The rest is vast desert ([[Kyzyl Kum]]) and mountains.[[File:Uzbekistan map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|left|Uzbekistan map of Köppen climate classification]]The highest point in Uzbekistan is the [[Khazret Sultan]], at {{convert|4643|m|ft}} above sea level, in the southern part of the [[Gissar Range]] in [[Surkhandarya Province]], on the border with Tajikistan, just northwest of [[Dushanbe]] (formerly called Peak of the 22nd Congress of the Communist Party).<ref name=uzstat>[http://enews.fergananews.com/article.php?id=2051 Uzbekistan will publish its own book of records&nbsp;– Ferghana.ru] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513010043/http://enews.fergananews.com/article.php?id=2051 |date=13 May 2013 }}. 18 July 2007.

Uzbekistan has a rich and diverse natural environment.

Due to the Aral Sea problem, high salinity and contamination of the soil with [[heavy elements]] are especially widespread in [[Karakalpakstan]], the region of Uzbekistan adjacent to the Aral Sea.

As China began to develop its silk trade with the West, Persian cities took advantage of this commerce by becoming centres of trade. Using an extensive network of cities and rural settlements in the province of [[Transoxiana]], and further east in what is today China's [[Xinjiang]] Uygur Autonomous Region, the Sogdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these Iranian merchants. As a result of this trade on what became known as the [[Silk Route]], Bukhara and Samarkand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times [[Transoxiana]] (Mawarannahr) was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.<ref name="Lubin-earlyhistory"/>

In 327 BC Macedonian ruler [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] provinces of Sogdiana and Bactria, which contained the territories of modern Uzbekistan. A conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of the Macedonian [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].  The kingdom was replaced with the Yuezhi dominated [[Kushan Empire]] in the 1st century BC. For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by the Persian empires, including the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] Empires, as well as by other empires, for example those formed by the Turko-Persian [[Hephthalite]] and Turkic [[Gokturk]] peoples.

In the 8th century, Transoxiana, the territory between the [[Amu Darya|Amudarya]] and [[Syr Darya|Syrdarya]] rivers, was conquered by the Arabs (Ali ibn Sattor) who enriched the region with the Early Renaissance. Many notable scientists lived there and contributed to its development during the Islamic Golden Age. Among the achievements of the scholars during this period were the development of [[trigonometry]] into its modern form (simplifying its practical application to calculate the phases of the moon), advances in [[optics]], in [[astronomy]], as well as in poetry, philosophy, art, calligraphy and many others, which set the foundation for the Muslim Renaissance.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

In the 9th and 10th centuries, Transoxiana was included into the [[Samanid]] State. Later, Transoxiana saw the incursion of the Turkic-ruled [[Karakhanids]], as well as the [[Seljuks]] (Sultan Sanjar) and [[Kara-Khitans]].<ref name="UNESCO">{{Cite book|last = Davidovich|first = E.

The [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] conquest under [[Genghis Khan]] during the 13th century would bring about a change to the region. The [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]] led to the displacement of some of the Iranian-speaking people of the region, their culture and heritage being superseded by that of the [[Mongols|Mongolian]]-[[Turkic peoples]] who came thereafter. The invasions of Bukhara, Samarkand, [[Köneürgenç|Urgench]] and others resulted in [[Destruction under the Mongol Empire|mass murders]] and unprecedented destruction, such as portions of [[Khwarazmian Empire|Khwarezmia]] being completely razed.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120118054002/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm Central Asian world cities (XI – XIII century)]. faculty.washington.edu</ref>

Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, the Mongol law of the Mongol Empire maintained orderly succession for several more generations, and control of most of Transoxiana stayed in the hands of the direct descendants of [[Chagatai Khan]], the second son of Genghis Khan. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained a strong and united kingdom (Ulus Batiy, Sattarkhan).<ref name="Lubin-Timur">''This section incorporates text from the following source, which is in the [[public domain]]'': Lubin, Nancy (1997).

He also invaded [[Russia]] before dying during an invasion of [[Ming dynasty|China]] in 1405.<ref name="Lubin-Timur"/>

Timur initiated the last flowering of Transoxiana by gathering together numerous artisans and scholars from the vast lands he had conquered into his capital, Samarqand. By supporting such people, he imbued his empire with a rich Perso-Islamic culture. During his reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants, a wide range of religious and palatial construction masterpieces were undertaken in Samarqand and other population centres.<ref>Forbes, Andrew, & Henley, David: ''[http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&acid=120613150427&aiid=120613151433 Timur's Legacy: The Architecture of Bukhara and Samarkand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524193127/http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&acid=120613150427&aiid=120613151433 |date=24 May 2013 }}'' (CPA Media).</ref> Amir Timur initiated an exchange of medical discoveries and patronized physicians, scientists and artists from the neighbouring countries such as India;<ref>Medical Links between India & Uzbekistan in Medieval Times by [[Hakim Syed Zillur Rahman]], Historical and Cultural Links between India & Uzbekistan, [[Khuda Bakhsh Oriental Library]], Patna, 1996. pp. 353–381.</ref> His grandson [[Ulugh Beg]] was one of the world's first great astronomers.

[[File:Islam karimov cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Islam Karimov]], the first President of Uzbekistan, during a visit to the Pentagon in 2002]]

After Uzbekistan declared independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, an election was held, and [[Islam Karimov]] was elected as the [[List of Presidents of Uzbekistan|first President]] of Uzbekistan.

The elections of the [[Supreme Assembly (Uzbekistan)|Oliy Majlis]] (Parliament or Supreme Assembly) were held under a resolution adopted by the 16th Supreme Soviet in 1994. In that year, the Supreme Soviet was replaced by the Oliy Majlis.

The third elections for the bicameral 150-member Oliy Majlis, the Legislative Chamber, and the 100-member Senate for five-year terms, were held on 27 December 2009. The second elections were held in December 2004 to January 2005. The Oliy Majlis was unicameral up to 2004. Its size increased from 69 deputies (members) in 1994 to 120 in 2004–05, and currently stands at 150.

{{Confusing|section|reason=the last paragraph seems to lack preceding context|date=August 2018}}

The referendum passed, and Islam Karimov's term was extended by an act of parliament to December 2007. Most international observers refused to participate in the process and did not recognize the results, dismissing them as not meeting basic standards. The 2002 referendum also included a plan for a bicameral parliament consisting of a lower house (the Oliy Majlis) and an upper house (Senate). Members of the lower house are to be "full-time" legislators. Elections for the new bicameral parliament took place on 26 December.

==Human rights==
{{Main|Human rights in Uzbekistan}}

The Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan asserts that "democracy in the Republic of Uzbekistan shall be based upon common human principles, according to which the highest value shall be the human being, his life, freedom, honour, dignity and other inalienable rights."

The official position is summarised in a memorandum "The measures taken by the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of providing and encouraging human rights"<ref>Embassy of Uzbekistan to the US, [https://archive.is/20121228073428/http://www.uzbekistan.org/press/archive/283/ Press-Release: "The measures taken by the government of the Republic of Uzbekistan in the field of providing and encouraging human rights"], 24 October 2005</ref> and amounts to the following: the government does everything that is in its power to protect and to guarantee the human rights of Uzbekistan's citizens. Uzbekistan continuously improves its laws and institutions in order to create a more humane society. Over 300 laws regulating the rights and basic freedoms of the people have been passed by the parliament.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Regions of Uzbekistan|Districts of Uzbekistan}}
Uzbekistan is divided into twelve [[province]]s (''viloyatlar'', singular ''[[viloyat]]'', compound noun ''viloyati'' e.g., Toshkent ''viloyati'', Samarqand ''viloyati'', etc.), one [[autonomous republic]] (''respublika'', compound noun ''respublikasi'' e.g. Qoraqalpogʻiston Muxtor ''Respublikasi'', Karakalpakstan ''Autonomous Republic'', etc.), and one [[independent city]] (''shahar'', compound noun ''shahri'', e.g., Toshkent ''shahri''). Names are given below in [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]] languages when applicable, although numerous variations of the transliterations of each name exist.

Facing a multitude of economic challenges upon acquiring independence, the government adopted an evolutionary reform strategy, with an emphasis on state control, reduction of imports and self-sufficiency in energy.

The government of Uzbekistan restricts foreign imports in many ways, including high import duties. Excise taxes are applied in a highly discriminatory manner to protect locally produced goods.

[[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]], also a Turkic language but closer to [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], is spoken in the [[Karakalpakstan|Republic of Karakalpakstan]] and has an official status there. This language is spoken by half a million people. More than 800,000 people also speak the Kazakh language.

Before the 1920s, the written language of Uzbeks was called Turki (known to Western scholars as [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]]) and used the [[Nastaʿlīq]] script. In 1926 the Latin alphabet was introduced and went through several revisions throughout the 1930s. Finally, in 1940, the Cyrillic alphabet was introduced by Soviet authorities and was used until the fall of Soviet Union. In 1993 Uzbekistan shifted back to the Latin script ([[Uzbek alphabet]]), which was modified in 1996 and is being taught in schools since 2000. In schools, colleges and universities teach only in Latin script. At the same time, in the country for Uzbek language is also used officially abolished the Cyrillic alphabet. Cyrillic is used in a number of popular newspapers and websites. Some of the text on the TV on some channels is duplicated on the Cyrillic alphabet. Cyrillic is popular with the older generation of Uzbeks who grew up on this alphabet.<ref>{{cite book |title=The New Woman in Uzbekistan: Islam, Modernity, and Unveiling Under Communism |last=Kamp |first=Marianne |year=2008 |publisher=University of Washington Press |isbn=978-0-295-98819-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYZVvJSdLBkC&pg=PP14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405011646/http://books.google.com/books?id=XYZVvJSdLBkC&pg=PP14 |archivedate=5 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Tashkent]], the nation's capital and largest city, has a three-line [[rapid transit|rapid transit system]] built in 1977, and expanded in 2001 after ten years' independence from the [[Soviet Union]]. Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan are currently the only two countries in Central Asia with a subway system. It is promoted as one of the cleanest systems in the former Soviet Union.<ref>[http://www.tashkent.org/uzland/subway.html Tashkent Subway for Quick Travel to Hotels, Resorts, and Around the City!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118202134/http://www.tashkent.org/uzland/subway.html |date=18 January 2012 }} tashkent.org</ref> The stations are exceedingly ornate. For example, the station ''Metro Kosmonavtov'' built in 1984 is decorated using a [[Human spaceflight|space travel]] theme to recognise the achievements of mankind in space exploration and to commemorate the role of [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]], the Soviet [[cosmonaut]] of Uzbek origin. A statue of Vladimir Dzhanibekov stands near a station entrance.

There are government-operated trams and buses running across the city. There are also many taxis, registered and unregistered. Uzbekistan has plants that produce modern cars. The car production is supported by the government and the Korean auto company [[Daewoo]]. In May 2007 [[UzDaewooAuto]], the car maker, signed a strategic agreement with General Motors-Daewoo Auto and Technology ([[GM Daewoo|GMDAT]], see [[:en:GM Uzbekistan|GM Uzbekistan]] also).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uzdaily.com/?c=118&a=1315 |title=Uzbekistan, General Motors sign strategic deal |publisher=Uzdaily.com |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516011802/http://www.uzdaily.com/?c=118&a=1315 |archivedate=16 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The government bought a stake in Turkey's Koc in [[SamKochAvto]], a producer of small buses and lorries.

Train links connect many towns in Uzbekistan, as well as neighboring former republics of the Soviet Union. Moreover, after independence two fast-running train systems were established.

There is a large airplane plant that was built during the Soviet era&nbsp;– [[Tashkent Aviation Production Association|Tashkent Chkalov Aviation Manufacturing Plant]] or ТАПОиЧ in Russian. The plant originated during World War II, when production facilities were evacuated south and east to avoid capture by advancing Nazi forces. Until the late 1980s, the plant was one of the leading aeroplane production centres in the USSR. With dissolution of the Soviet Union its manufacturing equipment became outdated; most of the workers were laid off. Now it produces only a few planes a year, but with interest from Russian companies growing, there are rumours of production-enhancement plans.

==Military==
{{Main|Armed Forces of the Republic of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Ukbekistani troops.jpg|thumb|right|Uzbek troops during a cooperative operation exercise]]
With close to 65,000 servicemen, Uzbekistan possesses the largest armed forces in Central Asia. The military structure is largely inherited from the [[Turkestan Military District]] of the [[Soviet Army]], although it is going through a reform to be based mainly on motorized infantry with some light and special forces{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}. The Uzbek Armed Forces' equipment is standard, mostly consisting those of Post-Soviet inheritance and newly crafted Russian and some American equipment.

The government has accepted the arms control obligations of the former Soviet Union, acceded to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (as a non-nuclear state), and supported an active program by the U.S. [[Defense Threat Reduction Agency]] (DTRA) in western Uzbekistan ([[Nukus]] and [[Vozrozhdeniye Island]]). The Government of Uzbekistan spends about 3.7% of GDP on the military but has received a growing infusion of Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and other security assistance funds since 1998.

Following 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S., Uzbekistan approved the [[U.S. Central Command]]'s request for access to an air base, the [[Karshi-Khanabad]] airfield, in southern Uzbekistan. However, Uzbekistan demanded that the U.S. withdraw from the airbases after the [[Andijan massacre]] and the U.S. reaction to this massacre. The last US troops left Uzbekistan in November 2005.

On 23 June 2006, Uzbekistan became a full participant in the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]] (CSTO), but informed the CSTO to suspend its membership in June 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/politics/uzbekistan-quits-pro-russian-bloc-996/ |title=Uzbekistan quits Russia-led CSTO military bloc |date=28 June 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502184452/http://rt.com/politics/uzbekistan-quits-pro-russian-bloc-996/ |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Foreign relations==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Uzbekistan|International organization membership of Uzbekistan}}

Uzbekistan joined the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] in December 1991. However, it is opposed to reintegration and withdrew from the CIS collective security arrangement in 1999. Since that time, Uzbekistan has participated in the CIS peacekeeping force in Tajikistan and in UN-organized groups to help resolve the Tajikistan and Afghanistan conflicts, both of which it sees as posing threats to its own stability.

Previously close to Washington (which gave Uzbekistan half a billion dollars in aid in 2004, about a quarter of its military budget), the government of Uzbekistan has recently restricted American military use of the airbase at [[Karshi-Khanabad]] for air operations in neighbouring Afghanistan.<ref>Marquardt, Erich and Wolfe, Adam (17 October 2005) [http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26246.html Rice Attempts to Secure US Influence in Central Asia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503094751/http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26246.html |date=3 May 2012 }}, Global Policy Forum.</ref> Uzbekistan was an active supporter of U.S. efforts against worldwide terrorism and joined the coalitions that have dealt with both Afghanistan and Iraq.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The relationship between Uzbekistan and the United States began to deteriorate after the so-called "[[colour revolutions]]" in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Ukraine]] (and to a lesser extent [[Kyrgyzstan]]). When the U.S. joined in a call for an independent international investigation of the bloody events at [[Andijan massacre|Andijan]], the relationship further declined, and President Islam Karimov changed the political alignment of the country to bring it closer to Russia and China.

In late July 2005, the government of Uzbekistan ordered the United States to vacate an air base in Karshi-Kanabad (near Uzbekistan's border with Afghanistan) within 180 days. Karimov had offered use of the base to the U.S. shortly after [[9/11]]. It is also believed by some Uzbeks that the protests in Andijan were brought about by the U.K. and U.S. influences in the area of Andijan. This is another reason for the hostility between Uzbekistan and the West.

Uzbekistan is a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN) (since 2 March 1992), the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC), [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP), and the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE). It belongs to the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) and the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]] (ECO) (comprising the five Central Asian countries, [[Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Pakistan]]). In 1999, Uzbekistan joined the [[GUAM]] alliance (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and [[Moldova]]), which was formed in 1997 (making it GUUAM), but pulled out of the organization in 2005.

[[File:2015 Summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization 03.jpg|thumb|Leaders present at the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation|SCO]] summit in [[Ufa]], Russia in 2015]]
Uzbekistan is also a member of the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]] (SCO) and hosts the SCO's Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure (RATS) in Tashkent. Uzbekistan joined the new [[Central Asian Cooperation Organisation]] (CACO) in 2002. The CACO consists of Uzbekistan, [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]] and Kyrgyzstan. It is a founding member of, and remains involved in, the [[Central Asian Union]], formed with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and joined in March 1998 by Tajikistan.

In September 2006, [[UNESCO]] presented Islam Karimov an award for Uzbekistan's preservation of its rich culture and traditions. Despite criticism, this seems to be a sign of improving relationships between Uzbekistan and the West.

The month of October 2006 also saw a decrease in the isolation of Uzbekistan from the West. The [[European Union|EU]] announced that it was planning to send a delegation to Uzbekistan to talk about human rights and liberties, after a long period of hostile relations between the two. Although it is equivocal about whether the official or unofficial version of the [[Andijan Massacre]] is true, the EU is evidently willing to ease its economic sanctions against Uzbekistan. Nevertheless, it is generally assumed among Uzbekistan's population that the government will stand firm in maintaining its close ties with the [[Russian Federation]] and in its theory that the 2004–2005 protests in Uzbekistan were promoted by the US and UK.

In January 2008, [[Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva]] was appointed to her current role as Uzbekistan's ambassador to [[UNESCO]]. Karimova-Tillyaeva and her team have been instrumental in promoting inter-cultural dialogue by increasing European society's awareness of Uzbekistan's cultural and historical heritage.

Uzbekistan has a wide mix of ethnic groups and cultures, with the [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] being the majority group. In 1995 about 71% of Uzbekistan's population was Uzbek. The chief minority groups were Russians (8%), [[Tājik people|Tajiks]] (5–30%),<ref name="Karl Cordell 1999. pg 201"/><ref name="Lena Jonson 2006. pg 108"/><ref name="Foltz2"/><ref name="cornellcaspian.com"/> [[Kazakhs]] (4%), [[Tatar]]s (2.5%) and [[Karakalpaks]] (2%). It is said, however, that the number of non-Uzbek people living in Uzbekistan is decreasing as Russians and other minority groups slowly leave and Uzbeks return from other parts of the former [[Soviet Union]].
[[File:Suzani (Boukhara, Ouzbékistan) (5657423581).jpg|thumb|Embroidery from Uzbekistan]]
When Uzbekistan gained independence in 1991, there was concern that [[Muslim fundamentalism]] would spread across the region. The expectation was that a country long denied freedom of religious practice would undergo a very rapid increase in the expression of its dominant faith. As of 1994, over half of Uzbekistan's population was said to be Muslim, though in an official survey few of that number had any real knowledge of the religion or knew how to practice it. However, Islamic observance is increasing in the region.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Uzbekistan}}
[[File:Boukhara 4696a.jpg|thumb|Silk and Spice Festival in [[Bukhara]]]]
Central Asian classical music is called [[Shashmaqam]], which arose in [[Bukhara]] in the late 16th century when that city was a regional capital. Shashmaqam is closely related to [[Azerbaijan]]i [[Mugam]] and [[Uyghur muqam]]. The name, which translates as ''six maqams'' refers to the structure of the music, which contains six sections in six different [[Musical mode]]s, similar to classical [[Persian traditional music]]. Interludes of spoken [[Sufi poetry]] interrupt the music, typically beginning at a lower register and gradually ascending to a climax before calming back down to the beginning tone.

===Education===
Uzbekistan has a high [[literacy rate]], with about 99.3% of adults above the age of 15 being able to read and write. However, with only 76% of the under-15 population currently enrolled in education (and only 20% of the 3–6 year olds attending pre-school), this figure may drop in the future. Students attend school Monday through Saturday during the school year, and education officially concludes at the end of the 12th grade. There are two international schools operating in Uzbekistan, both in Tashkent: The British School catering for elementary students only, and [[Tashkent International School]], a K-12 international curriculum school.

Uzbekistan has encountered severe budget shortfalls in its education program. The education law of 1992 began the process of theoretical reform, but the physical base has deteriorated and curriculum revision has been slow. A large contributor to this decline is the low level of wages received by teachers and the lack of spending on infrastructure, buildings and resources on behalf of the government. Corruption within the education system is also rampant, with students from wealthier families routinely bribing teachers and school executives to achieve high grades without attending school, or undertaking official examinations.<ref>Kozlova, Marina (21 January 2008) [http://chalkboard.tol.org/uzbekistan-lessons-in-graft Uzbekistan: Lessons in Graft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608053517/http://chalkboard.tol.org/uzbekistan-lessons-in-graft |date=8 June 2012 }}.  Chalkboard.tol.org</ref>

Uzbekistan's universities create almost 600,000 graduates annually, though the general standard of university graduates, and the overall level of education within the tertiary system, is low. Several universities, including [[Westminster International University in Tashkent|Westminster University]], [[Turin University]], [[Management Development Institute of Singapore in Tashkent|Management University Institute of Singapore]], [http://www.but.uz/ Bucheon University in Tashkent]|Bucheon University]] and [[Inha University Tashkent]] maintain a campus in Tashkent offering English language courses across several disciplines. The Russian-language high education is provided by most national universities, including foreign [[Moscow State University]] and [[Gubkin Russian State University of Oil and Gas]], maintaining campuses in Tashkent.

[[File:Plov.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palov]]]]
[[File:Uzbek Manti (bright).jpg|thumb|right|Uzbek [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]]]]
Uzbek cuisine is influenced by local [[agriculture]], as in most nations. There is a great deal of grain farming in Uzbekistan, so breads and noodles are of importance and Uzbek cuisine has been characterized as "noodle-rich". [[Mutton]] is a popular variety of meat due to the abundance of sheep in the country and it is part of various Uzbek dishes.

Uzbekistan's signature dish is [[palov]] (''plov'' or ''osh''), a main course typically made with [[rice]], pieces of [[meat]], and grated [[carrot]]s and [[onion]]s. ''Oshi nahor'', or morning ''plov'', is served in the early morning (between 6 am and 9 am) to large gatherings of guests, typically as part of an ongoing wedding celebration. Other notable national dishes include [[shurpa]] (''shurva'' or ''shorva''), a soup made of large pieces of fatty meat (usually [[mutton]]), and fresh vegetables; [[Naryn (soup)|norin]] and [[Laghman (soup)|laghman]], noodle-based dishes that may be served as a soup or a main course; [[Manti (dumpling)|manti]], [[chuchvara]], and [[somsa]], stuffed pockets of [[dough]] served as an appetizer or a main course; [[dimlama]], a meat and vegetable stew; and various [[kebabs]], usually served as a main course.

[[Green tea]] is the national hot beverage taken throughout the day; [[teahouses]] (''chaikhanas'') are of cultural importance. [[Black tea]] is preferred in [[Tashkent]], but both green and black teas are taken daily, without milk or sugar. Tea always accompanies a meal, but it is also a drink of hospitality that is automatically offered: green or black to every guest. [[Ayran]], a chilled yogurt drink, is popular in summer, but does not replace hot tea.

The use of alcohol is less widespread than in the West, but wine is comparatively popular for a Muslim nation as Uzbekistan is largely secular. Uzbekistan has 14 wineries, the oldest and most famous being the Khovrenko Winery in [[Samarkand]] (established in 1927). The Samarkand Winery produces a range of dessert wines from local grape varieties: Gulyakandoz, Shirin, Aleatiko, and Kabernet likernoe (literally [[Cabernet Sauvignon|Cabernet]] dessert wine in Russian). Uzbek wines have received international awards and are exported to Russia and other countries.

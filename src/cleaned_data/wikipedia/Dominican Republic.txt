== Names and etymology ==
The "Dominican" word comes from the Latin ''Dominicus'', meaning Sunday. However, the island has this name by [[Saint Dominic|Santo Domingo de Guzmán]], founder of the Order of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]].

The Dominicans established a house of high studies in the island of [[Santo Domingo]] that today is known as the [[Universidad Autónoma de Santo Domingo]] and dedicated themselves to the protection of the native taínos of the island, who were subjected to slavery, and to the education of the inhabitants of the island.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laromanabayahibenews.com/2012/06/gentilicio-dominicano-origen-etimologico-motivaciones-historicas-por-giancarlo-d%E2%80%99alessandro-i-bandera-es-tu-bandera-proyecto-de-exposiciones-fotograficas-itinerantes-por-frank-luna/ |title=Gentilicio Dominicano: Origen Etimológico & Motivaciones Históricas.

For most of its history, up until independence, the country was known as '''{{lang|es|Santo Domingo}}'''<ref name=firstcolony>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– The first colony |accessdate=June 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>—the name of its present capital and patron saint, [[Saint Dominic]]—and continued to be commonly known as such in English until the early 20th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CLpoeD3cbBkC&pg=PA1#v=onepage Hand Book of Santo Domingo:] Bulletin, Issue 52.

In the [[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|national anthem of the Dominican Republic]] ({{lang|es|himno nacional de la República Dominicana}}), the term "Dominicans" does not appear. The author of its lyrics, [[Emilio Prud'Homme]], consistently uses the poetic term "Quisqueyans" ({{lang|es|Quisqueyanos}}). The word "Quisqueya" derives from a native tongue of the Taino Indians and means "Mother of the lands" ({{lang|es|Madre de las tierras}}). It is often used in songs as another name for the country. The name of the country is often shortened to "the D.R."

The Spaniards arrived in 1492.

[[Christopher Columbus]] arrived on the island in December 5, 1492, during the first of his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|four voyages]] to the Americas. He claimed the land for Spain and named it ''La Española'' due to its diverse climate and terrain which reminded him of the [[Spain|Spanish landscape]].<ref>[http://www.catholictradition.org/Tradition/christopher-columbus.htm Christopher Columbus].

In 1496 [[Bartholomew Columbus]], Christopher's brother, built the city of [[Santo Domingo]], Western Europe's first permanent settlement in the "[[New World]]." The colony thus became the springboard for the further [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish conquest of the Americas]] and for decades the [[captaincy general of santo domingo|headquarters]] of Spanish colonial power in the hemisphere. Soon after the largest discovery of gold in the island was made in the [[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|cordillera central]] region, which led to a mining boom. By 1501, Columbus's cousin Giovanni Columbus, had also discovered gold near Buenaventura, the deposits were later known as Minas Nuevas. Two major mining areas resulted, one along [[San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic|San Cristóbal]]-Buenaventura, and another in Cibao within the [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|La Vega]]-Cotuy-[[Bonao]] triangle, while [[Santiago de los Caballeros]], [[La Vega, Dominican Republic|Concepcion]], and Bonao became mining towns.  The [[gold rush]] of 1500–1508 ensued.<ref name="Floyd">{{cite book |last1=Floyd |first1=Troy |title=The Columbus Dynasty in the Caribbean, 1492–1526 |date=1973 |publisher=University of New Mexico Press |location=Albuquerque |pages=44, 50, 57–58, 74}}</ref> [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] "ordered gold from the richest mines reserved for the Crown." Thus, Ovando expropriated the gold mines of Miguel Diaz and Francisco de Garay in 1504, as pit mines became royal mines, though [[placer mining|placers]] were open to private prospectors. Furthermore, Ferdinand wanted the "best Indians" working his royal mines, and kept 967 in the San Cristóbal mining area supervised by salaried miners.<ref name=Floyd/>{{rp|68,71,78,125–127}}

Under [[Nicolás de Ovando y Cáceres]]' governorship, the Indians were made to work in the gold mines, "where they were grossly overworked, mistreated, and underfed," according to Pons.  By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines as part of the [[encomienda]] system.  According to Pons, "Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out."  By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained.  About half were located in the mining towns of Concepción, Santiago, Santo Domingo, and Buenaventura.  The [[repartimiento]] of 1514 accelerated emigration of the Spanish colonists, coupled with the exhaustion of the mines. In 1516, a smallpox epidemic killed an additional 8,000, of the remaining 11,000 Indians, in one month.  By 1519, according to Pons, "Both the gold economy and the Indian population became extinct at the same time."<ref name="Pons">{{cite book|last1=Pons|first1=Frank|title=The Dominican Republic, A National History|date=1995|publisher=Hispaniola Books|location=New Rochelle|isbn=978-1885509017|pages=33–37}}</ref><ref name=Floyd/>{{rp|191–192}}

The southern city of Santo Domingo served as a springboard for military expeditions pushing across to the mainland of the Americas. In 1501, the colony began to import African slaves. After its conquest of the [[Aztec]]s and [[Inca Empire|Incas]], Spain neglected its Caribbean holdings. The slaves remained and became the basis for the Dominican population.<ref name=Greenberg>{{cite web|title=UNITED STATES ARMY UNILATERAL AND COALITION OPERATIONS IN THE 1965 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC INTERVENTION|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a181823.pdf}}</ref> Following royal orders, in 1605 Governor Antonio Osorio ignored ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' protests and had the settlements at Puerto Plata, Montecristi, La Yaguana, and Bayaja burned to stop smuggling. Some rebelled and were defeated while others fled to Cuba. Only 2,000 livestock out of 110,000 survived in the new pasture. One third of the people from La Yaguana and Bayaja who were settled at Bayaguana died of hunger and disease by 1609.

The French were envious of [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]]'s possessions in the Americas, and thus sent colonists to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola. In order to domesticate the [[buccaneer]]s, the French supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to [[Kingdom of France|France]] with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony there, while the Spanish colony suffered an economic decline.<ref name="google48">{{cite book |editor-last=Knight |editor-first=Franklin W. |title=General history of the Caribbean |date=1997 |publisher=Unesco |location=London |isbn=978-92-3-103146-5 |page=48 |edition=1. publ. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&lpg=PR2&pg=PR2#v=onepage |accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>

On April 17, 1655, the English landed on nearby Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to [[Santo Domingo]], the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted [[lancer]]s, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was “so much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.” The elite [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|defenders of Santo Domingo]] were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.

The French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a [[smallpox]] epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687 the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691 the Spaniards [[Battle of Sabana Real|attacked the north]] and sacked Cap-François. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch—the deformed invalid Charles II—died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.

=== 18th century ===
The [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 17th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present day Haiti)&nbsp;– the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.<ref name="google48"/>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm|title=Dominican Republic - THE FIRST COLONY|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island.

When the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Spain and Britain broke out in 1739, Spanish [[privateer]]s, particularly from Santo Domingo, began to troll the Caribbean Sea, a development that lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise—foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons—that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=57}}</ref> As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=Scheina>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.

Although the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in Europe (see [[War of the Pyrenees]]). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.

In 1801, [[Toussaint Louverture]], who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the treaty. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Leclerc]] when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time the Haitian General [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw. As Christophe retreated across the island, he slaughtered and burned.<ref name="Short Dominican History">{{cite web|title=A Short History of Dominican Republic|url=http://www.studycountry.com/guide/DO-history.htm}}</ref> In October 1808 the landowner [[Juan Sánchez Ramírez]] began a rebellion against the French colonial government in Santo Domingo and the insurgents were aided by Puerto Rico and British Jamaica.<ref name="Bethell">{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=245–48}}</ref> The British ejected the French and returned Santo Domingo to the Spaniards in 1809.

After a dozen years of discontent and failed independence plots by various opposing groups, Santo Domingo's former Lieutenant-Governor (top administrator), [[José Núñez de Cáceres]], declared the colony's independence from the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish crown]] as [[Republic of Spanish Haiti|Spanish Haiti]], on November 30, 1821.

The newly independent republic ended two months later under the Haitian government led by [[Jean-Pierre Boyer]].<ref name="guitar">{{cite web |last = Guitar |first = Lynne |title = History of the Dominican Republic |publisher = Hola.com |url = http://www.hispaniola.com/dominican_republic/info/history.php |accessdate = May 29, 2007 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070601040005/http://www.hispaniola.com/dominican_republic/info/history.php |archivedate = June 1, 2007 |df = mdy-all }}</ref>

As Toussaint Louverture had done two decades earlier, the Haitians abolished slavery. In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.<ref>''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of "scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch." (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)</ref> In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.

Haiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. Many emigrated to [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (these two being [[Spanish Empire|Spanish possessions]] at the time), or [[Gran Colombia]], usually with the encouragement of Haitian officials who acquired their lands. The Haitians associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]].

All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to "forage and sack" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a "heavy tribute" on the Dominican people.<ref name=Matibag/>{{rp|page number needed}}

Many whites fled Santo Domingo for [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Cuba]] (both still under Spanish rule), [[Venezuela]], and elsewhere. In the end the economy faltered and taxation became more onerous. Rebellions occurred even by Dominican freedmen, while Dominicans and Haitians worked together to oust Boyer from power. Anti-Haitian movements of several kinds&nbsp;– pro-independence, pro-Spanish, pro-French, pro-British, pro-United States&nbsp;– gathered force following the overthrow of Boyer in 1843.<ref name=Matibag/>{{rp|page number needed}}

[[File:Parque y Parroquia Hato Mayor.jpg|thumb|Statues honoring Trinitarian leaders [[Juan Pablo Duarte]], [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]], and [[Matías Ramón Mella]].]]
In 1838 [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.<ref name="pons">{{cite book |first=Frank |last =Moya Pons| authorlink =Frank Moya Pons | title = The Dominican Republic: A National History|edition= August 1, 1998|page= 543 |publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers; 2nd edition| isbn= 978-1-55876-191-9|year =1998}}</ref>{{rp|p147–149}} Also [[Francisco del Rosario Sánchez]] and [[Ramon Matias Mella]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence.

The ''Trinitarios'' took advantage of a Haitian rebellion against the dictator Jean-Pierre Boyer. They rose up on January 27, 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian [[Charles Rivière-Hérard|Charles Hérard]] who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. However, the movement soon discarded its pretext of support for Hérard and now championed Dominican independence. After overthrowing Boyer, Hérard executed some Dominicans, and threw many others into prison; Duarte escaped.<ref name=Scheina/> After subduing the Dominicans, Hérard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in [[Port-au-Prince]]. Haiti had formed two regiments composed of Dominicans from the city of Santo Domingo; these were used by Hérard to suppress the uprising.<ref name=Scheina/>

On February 27, 1844, the surviving members of ''La Trinitaria'' declared the independence from Haiti. They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name="Encarta"/> The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura Báez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and Báez the United States.

Threatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President Hérard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses. According to José María Imbert's (the General defending Santiago) report of April 5, 1844 to Santo Domingo, “in Santiago, the enemy did not leave behind in the battlefield less than six hundred dead and…the number of wounded was very superior…[while on] our part we suffered not one casualty.”<ref>{{cite web|title=The Siblings of Hispaniola: Political Union and Separation of Haiti and Santo Domingo, 1822-1844|url=http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03272011-220809/unrestricted/DePena.pdf}}</ref>

The Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845. The Haitians invaded again in 1849 after [[France]] recognized the Dominican Republic as an independent nation.

=== [[First Republic (Dominican Republic)|First Republic]] ===
{{double image|right|Santana.gif|150|Buenaventura Baéz.gif|150|[[Pedro Santana]] and [[Buenaventura Báez]], the ''[[caudillo]]s'' who led the Dominican Republic during its first republican period}}

The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844. The state was commonly known as Santo Domingo in English until the early 20th century.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=CLpoeD3cbBkC&pg=PA1 Hand Book of Santo Domingo:] Bulletin, Issue 52. U.S. Government Printing Office, 1892. Digitized 14 August 2012. p. 3. ''"...the Republic of Santo Domingo or República Dominicana (Dominican Republic) as it is officially designated."''</ref>  It featured a presidential form of government with many liberal tendencies, but it was marred by Article 210, imposed by [[Pedro Santana]] on the constitutional assembly by force, giving him the privileges of a dictatorship until the war of independence was over. These privileges not only served him to win the war, but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola|page=114}}</ref>

Without adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hard woods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign, and was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Manuel Jimenes]].

After defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'état. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura Báez as President, but Báez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853 Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing Báez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Samaná Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling Báez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, Báez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for [[hard cash]] at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by [[José Desiderio Valverde]] and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General [[Juan Luis Franco Bidó]] besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bidó in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both Báez and Valverde and installed himself as president.<ref name=Cross>{{cite book |title= Sociedad y desarrollo en República Dominicana, 1844-1899 |date= 1984 |last=Cross Beras |first=Julio A. |publisher=CENAPEC |isbn=978-84-89525-17-7}}</ref>

=== Restoration republic ===
{{See also|Dominican Restoration War}}
[[File:Luperoncaballo.JPG|thumb|[[Gregorio Luperon]] fought against the pretensions of Pedro Santana to recover the Dominican sovereignty.]]
In 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|colonial status]]. This action was supported by the cattlemen of the south while the northern elites opposed it.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Bulmer|editor1-first=Martin|editor2-last=Solomos|editor2-first=John|title=Gender, Race and Religion: Intersections and Challenges|date=2014|publisher=Routledge}}</ref> Spanish rule finally came to an end with the War of Restoration in 1865, after four years of conflict between Dominican nationalists and Spanish sympathizers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Howard|first1=David|title=Coloring the Nation: Race and Ethnicity in the Dominican Republic|page=28}}</ref>

Political strife again prevailed in the following years; warlords ruled, military revolts were extremely common, and the nation amassed debt. In 1869, President [[Ulysses S.

Báez was toppled in 1874, returned, and was toppled for good in 1878. A new generation was thence in charge, with the passing of Santana (he died in 1864) and Báez from the scene. Relative peace came to the country in the 1880s, which saw the coming to power of General [[Ulises Heureaux]].<ref name=countrystudies>{{cite web |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Ulises Heureaux, 1882–99 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/8.htm |accessdate=December 23, 2007}}</ref>

"Lilís," as the new president was nicknamed, enjoyed a period of popularity. He was, however, "a consummate dissembler," who put the nation deep into debt while using much of the proceeds for his personal use and to maintain his police state. Heureaux became rampantly despotic and unpopular.<ref name=countrystudies/><ref>{{cite book|last=Langley|first=Lester D.|title=The Banana Wars|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8420-5047-0|page=20|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Xc1RBfZd3pcC&pg=PA20|year=2002}}</ref> In 1899 he was assassinated.

=== 20th century (1900–30)===
[[File:Alejandro Woss y Gil.jpg|thumb|right|President [[Alejandro Woss y Gil]] taking office in 1903]]
From 1902 on, short-lived governments were again the norm, with their power usurped by [[caudillo]]s in parts of the country. Furthermore, the national government was bankrupt and, unable to pay Heureaux's debts, faced the threat of military intervention by France and other European creditor powers.<ref name=cs9>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/9.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– Renewed conflict, 1899–1916 |accessdate=October 19, 2008 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sought to prevent European intervention, largely to protect the routes to the future [[Panama Canal]], as the canal was already under construction. He made a small [[1916 United States occupation of the Dominican Republic|military intervention]] to ward off European powers, to proclaim his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], and also to obtain his 1905 Dominican agreement for U.S. administration of Dominican customs, which was the chief source of income for the Dominican government. A 1906 agreement provided for the arrangement to last 50 years. The United States agreed to use part of the customs proceeds to reduce the immense foreign debt of the Dominican Republic and assumed responsibility for said debt.<ref name=Encarta/><ref name=cs9/>

[[File:Ramon Caceres.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Ramón Cáceres]]]]
After six years in power, President [[Ramón Cáceres]] (who had himself assassinated Heureaux)<ref name=countrystudies/> was assassinated in 1911. The result was several years of great political instability and civil war. U.S. mediation by the [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Woodrow Wilson]] administrations achieved only a short respite each time. A political deadlock in 1914 was broken after an ultimatum by Wilson telling the Dominicans to choose a president or see the U.S. impose one. A provisional president was chosen, and later the same year relatively free elections put former president (1899–1902) [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] back in power. To achieve a more broadly supported government, Jimenes named opposition individuals to his cabinet. But this brought no peace and, with his former [[Secretary of War]] [[Desiderio Arias]] maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.<ref name="congress">{{cite web| title=Dominican Republic: Occupation by the United States, 1916–1924| work=Country Studies| publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division| url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/10.htm| accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>

Wilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic. [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] landed on May 16, 1916, and had control of the country two months later. The military government established by the U.S., led by Vice Admiral [[Harry Shepard Knapp]], was widely repudiated by the Dominicans, with many factions within the country leading guerrilla campaigns against U.S. forces.<ref name="congress"/> The occupation regime kept most Dominican laws and institutions and largely pacified the general population. The occupying government also revived the Dominican economy, reduced the nation's debt, built a road network that at last interconnected all regions of the country, and created a professional National Guard to replace the warring partisan units.<ref name="congress"/>

Vigorous opposition to the occupation continued, nevertheless, and after World War I it increased in the U.S. as well. There, President [[Warren G. Harding]] (1921–23), Wilson's successor, worked to put an end to the occupation, as he had promised to do during his campaign. The U.S. government's rule ended in October 1922, and elections were held in March 1924.<ref name="congress"/>
[[File:Horacio Vasquez.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Horacio Vásquez]]]]
The victor was former president (1902–03) [[Horacio Vásquez]], who had cooperated with the U.S. He was inaugurated on July 13, and the last U.S. forces left in September. In six years, the Marines were involved in at least 467 engagements, with 950 insurgents killed or wounded in action.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE CARIBBEAN WAR. The United States in the Caribbean, 1898-1998|url=http://www.cercles.com/n5/dosal.pdf|publisher=University of South Florida}}</ref> Vásquez gave the country six years of stable governance, in which political and civil rights were respected and the economy grew strongly, in a relatively peaceful atmosphere.<ref name="congress"/><ref name=locdr11>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/11.htm |title=Dominican Republic&nbsp;– The era of Trujillo| work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division}}</ref>

During the government of Horacio Vásquez, [[Rafael Trujillo]] held the rank of lieutenant colonel and was chief of police. This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of Vásquez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Peña, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of Vásquez.

In February 1930, when Vásquez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]]. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader [[Rafael Estrella Ureña]]; in return for letting Ureña take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, Vásquez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning "neutrality," Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ureña's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ureña was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.

As per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalición patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ureña as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.

=== Trujillo Age (1930–61)===
[[File:Rafel Trujillo 1934.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Rafael Trujillo]] imposed a dictatorship of 31 years in the country (1930-1961)]]

There was considerable economic growth during [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan. He finally negotiated an undisputed border with Haiti in 1935 and achieved the end of the 50-year customs agreement in 1941, instead of 1956. He made the country debt-free in 1947.<ref name=Encarta/><ref name=Galvan>{{cite book|author=Javier A.

This was accompanied by absolute repression and the copious use of murder, torture, and terrorist methods against the opposition. Trujillo renamed [[Santo Domingo]] to "Ciudad Trujillo" (Trujillo City),<ref name=Encarta/> the nation's&nbsp;– and the Caribbean's&nbsp;– highest mountain ''[[Pico Duarte|La Pelona Grande]]'' (Spanish for: The Great Bald) to "Pico Trujillo" (Spanish for: Trujillo Peak), and many towns and a province.

On November 25, 1960, Trujillo killed three of the four [[Mirabal sisters]], nicknamed ''Las Mariposas'' (The Butterflies). The victims were Patria Mercedes Mirabal (born on February 27, 1924), Argentina Minerva Mirabal (born on March 12, 1926), and Antonia María Teresa Mirabal (born on October 15, 1935). Along with their husbands, the sisters were conspiring to overthrow Trujillo in a violent revolt. The Mirabals had communist ideological leanings as did their husbands. The sisters have received many honors posthumously and have many memorials in various cities in the Dominican Republic. Salcedo, their home province, changed its name to [[Hermanas Mirabal Province|Provincia Hermanas Mirabal]] (Mirabal Sisters Province). The [[International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women]] is observed on the anniversary of their deaths.

For a long time, the U.S. and the Dominican elite supported the Trujillo government. This support persisted despite the assassinations of political opposition, the massacre of Haitians, and Trujillo's plots against other countries. The U.S. believed Trujillo was the lesser of two or more evils.<ref name="Wucker"/> The U.S. finally broke with Trujillo in 1960, after Trujillo's agents attempted to assassinate the Venezuelan president, [[Rómulo Betancourt]], a fierce critic of Trujillo.<ref name=locdr11/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826562,00.html|title=Trying to Topple Trujillo|work=Time Magazine|date=5 September 1960|accessdate=26 December 2007}}</ref>

His tenure was a period of repression of human rights and civil liberties, ostensibly to keep pro-Castro or pro-communist parties out of power; 11,000 persons were killed.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.listindiario.com/la-republica/2013/3/9/268859/11000-victimas-en-Doce-Anos-de-JB |title= 11,000 víctimas en Doce Años de JB |publisher=Listín Diario |date=10 March 2013 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Quiroz |first=Fernando|url= http://www.listindiario.com/la-republica/2013/3/9/268858/Comision-de-la-Verdad-por-asesinatos-y-desapariciones |title= Comisión de la Verdad por asesinatos y desapariciones |publisher=Listín Diario |location=Santo Domingo |date=10 March 2013 |language=Spanish}}</ref> His rule was criticized for a growing disparity between rich and poor. It was, however, praised for an ambitious infrastructure program, which included construction of large housing projects, sports complexes, theaters, museums, aqueducts, roads, highways, and the massive [[Columbus Lighthouse]], completed in 1992 during a later tenure.

In 1978, Balaguer was succeeded in the presidency by opposition candidate [[Antonio Guzmán Fernández]], of the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party]] (PRD). Another PRD win in 1982 followed, under [[Salvador Jorge Blanco]]. Under the PRD presidents, the Dominican Republic enjoyed a period of relative freedom and basic human rights.

Balaguer regained the presidency in 1986 and was re-elected in 1990 and 1994, this last time just defeating PRD candidate [[José Francisco Peña Gómez]], a former mayor of Santo Domingo.<!--some info needs to be added about Balaguer's performance 1986-96--> The 1994 elections were flawed, bringing on international pressure, to which Balaguer responded by scheduling another presidential contest in 1996.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:República_Dominicana.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of the Dominican Republic.]]
[[File:Dominican Republic relief location map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The Dominican Republic's topography]]
The Dominican Republic is situated on the eastern part of the second largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]], [[Hispaniola]]. It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with [[Haiti]]. The country's area is reported variously as {{convert|48442|km²|0|abbr=on}} (by the embassy in the United States)<ref name=embassy/> and {{convert|48730|km²|0|abbr=on}},<ref name="CIADemo"/> making it the second largest country in the [[Antilles]], after [[Cuba]]. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest metropolitan area [[Santo Domingo]] is on the southern coast.

There are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that are part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and Beata, in the southwest. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the ''Cordillera Septentrional'' ("Northern Mountain Range"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]], near the Haitian border, to the Samaná Peninsula in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic&nbsp;– indeed, in the whole of the West Indies&nbsp;– is the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' ("Central Mountain Range"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of [[Azua de Compostela|Azua]], on the Caribbean coast.
[[File:Constanza (15196384558).jpg|thumb|[[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]] valley]]
In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level), La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges. The more northerly of the two is the ''Sierra de Neiba'', while in the south the ''Sierra de Bahoruco'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' ("Eastern Mountain Range"), ''Sierra Martín García'', ''Sierra de Yamasá'', and ''Sierra de Samaná''.

Between the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Concepción de La Vega|La Vega]] and most of the farming areas in the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land in the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.

The ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' ("Caribbean Coastal Plain") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' ("Azua Plain"), a very arid region in [[Azua Province]]. A few other small coastal plains are in the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.
[[File:Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves.jpeg|thumb|left|Mangroves in Los Haitises National Park]]
Four major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the Vega Real and empties into Samaná Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.

There are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest point in the Caribbean. Other important lakes are Laguna de Rincón or Cabral, with [[freshwater|fresh water]], and Laguna de Oviedo, a lagoon with [[brackish water]].

Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946 it suffered [[1946 Dominican Republic earthquake|a magnitude 8.1 earthquake]] off the northeast coast. This triggered a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. The wave was also recorded at Daytona Beach, Florida, and Atlantic City, New Jersey. The area remains at risk. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping risk in low-lying areas.

The annual average temperature is {{convert|25|C|F}}. At higher elevations the temperature averages {{convert|18|C|F|1}} while near sea level the average temperature is {{convert|28|C|F|1}}. Low temperatures of {{convert|0|C|F}} are possible in the mountains while high temperatures of {{convert|40|C|F}} are possible in protected valleys. January and February are the coolest months of the year while August is the hottest month. Snowfall can be seen in rare occasions on the summit of [[Pico Duarte]].<ref name="DRcli"/>

The [[wet season]] along the northern coast lasts from November through January. Elsewhere the wet season stretches from May through November, with May being the wettest month.

=== Military ===
[[File:Two Commando soldiers of the MEFA provide security.jpg|thumb|Dominican soldiers training in Santo Domingo]]
{{Main|Military of the Dominican Republic}}
[[Congress of the Dominican Republic|Congress]] authorizes a combined military force of 44,000 active duty personnel. Actual active duty strength is approximately 32,000. Approximately 50% of those are used for non-military activities such as security providers for government-owned non-military facilities, highway toll stations, prisons, forestry work, state enterprises, and private businesses. The commander in chief of the military is the president.

The army is larger than the other services combined with approximately 20,000 active duty personnel, consisting of six infantry [[brigade]]s, a combat support brigade, and a combat service support brigade. The air force operates two main bases, one in the southern region near Santo Domingo and one in the northern region near Puerto Plata. The navy operates two major naval bases, one in Santo Domingo and one in Las Calderas on the southwestern coast, and maintains 12 operational vessels. The Dominican Republic has the second largest military in the Caribbean region after Cuba.<ref name=ussdnote/>

The armed forces have organized a Specialized Airport Security Corps (CESA) and a Specialized Port Security Corps (CESEP) to meet international security needs in these areas. The secretary of the armed forces has also announced plans to form a specialized border corps (CESEF). The armed forces provide 75% of personnel to the National Investigations Directorate (DNI) and the Counter-Drug Directorate (DNCD).<ref name=ussdnote/>

The Dominican National Police force contains 32,000 agents. The police are not part of the Dominican armed forces but share some overlapping security functions. Sixty-three percent of the force serve in areas outside traditional police functions, similar to the situation of their military counterparts.<ref name=ussdnote/>

=== Administrative divisions ===

[[Remittance]]s in Dominican Republic increased to US$4571.30 million in 2014 from US$3333 million in 2013 (according to data reported by the Inter-American Development Bank). Economic growth takes place in spite of a chronic energy shortage,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cne.gov.do/Page.asp?key=89 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116034631/http://www.cne.gov.do/Page.asp?key=89 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 16, 2009 |title=Fernández Zucco anuncia celebración Semana Internacional de la Energía |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |language=Spanish |df= }}</ref> which causes frequent blackouts and very high prices. Despite a widening merchandise [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]], tourism earnings and remittances have helped build [[foreign exchange reserves]]. Following economic turmoil in the late 1980s and 1990, during which the gross domestic product (GDP) fell by up to 5% and consumer price inflation reached an unprecedented 100%, the Dominican Republic entered a period of growth and declining inflation until 2002, after which the economy entered a [[recession]].<ref name=ussdnote/>

This recession followed the collapse of the second-largest [[commercial bank]] in the country, [[Banco Intercontinental|Baninter]], linked to a major incident of fraud valued at US$3.5 billion. The Baninter fraud had a devastating effect on the Dominican economy, with GDP dropping by 1% in 2003 as inflation ballooned by over 27%.

According to the 2005 Annual Report of the United Nations Subcommittee on Human Development in the Dominican Republic, the country is ranked No. 71 in the world for resource availability, No. 79 for human development, and No. 14 in the world for resource mismanagement. These statistics emphasize national government corruption, foreign economic interference in the country, and the rift between the rich and poor.

=== Tourism ===

[[File:Club Med (Punta Cana).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Punta Cana]]]]
The Dominican Republic is the [[world Tourism rankings|most visited destination]] in the Caribbean. The year-round golf courses are major attractions.<ref name=consulate/> A geographically diverse nation, the Dominican Republic is home to both the Caribbean's tallest mountain peak, [[Pico Duarte]], and the Caribbean's largest lake and point of lowest elevation, [[Lake Enriquillo]].<ref name="Baker 2008 190"/> The island has an average temperature of {{convert|26|°C|°F|1}} and great climatic and biological diversity.<ref name="consulate"/> The country is also the site of the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress built in the Americas, located in Santo Domingo's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], a [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name="Colonial City of Santo Domingo"/><ref name="unesco.org"/>

Tourism is one of the fueling factors in the Dominican Republic's economic growth. The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the [[Caribbean]]. With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa De Campo]] and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.

[[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]], and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years. Notably due to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10&nbsp;km from the Haitian boarder.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===
{{Main|Transportation in the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Obelisco Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|El Malecon av. in [[Santo Domingo]]]]
The country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternative routes ([[DR-4]]).

In addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Samaná Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa&nbsp;– Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza&nbsp;– Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages but currently on hold.

=== Bus service ===
There are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina Técnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federación Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opción (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.

There are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Turísticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.

=== Santo Domingo Metro ===
[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]
{{Main|Santo Domingo Metro}}
The Dominican Republic has a [[rapid transit]] system in [[Santo Domingo]], the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular [[Caribbean]] and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major "National Master Plan" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the [[DR-1|Máximo Gómez]] and [[DR-13|Hermanas Mirabal Avenue]]. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the [[DR-13|Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario]] Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open {{as of|2013|August|lc=y}}, is {{convert|27.35|km|mi}}. Before the opening of the second line, 30,856,515 passengers rode the Santo Domingo Metro in 2012.<ref name="SD-stats">{{cite web|url=http://opret.gob.do/Documentos/Estad%C3%ADsticas%20Institucionales/Estad%C3%ADsticas%20de%20peaje%20y%20tiempo%20de%20recorrido%20al%202013.pdf|title=Estadísticas de peaje y tiempo de recorrido al 2013|trans-title=Statistics of tolls and times of route 2013|language=es|work=opret.gob.do|page=2|date=September 2013|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref> With both lines opened, ridership increased to 61,270,054 passengers in 2014.

=== Communications ===
{{Main|Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic}}
The Dominican Republic has a well developed [[Telecommunications in the Dominican Republic|telecommunications]] infrastructure, with extensive mobile phone and [[landline]] services. [[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.

For commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (''Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones'').

The largest telecommunications company is [[Claro República Dominicana|Claro]]&nbsp;– part of [[Carlos Slim]]'s [[América Móvil]]&nbsp;– which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and [[IPTV]] services. In June 2009 there were more than 8 million phone line subscribers (land and cell users) in the D.R., representing 81% of the country's population and a fivefold increase since the year 2000, when there were 1.6 million. The communications sector generates about 3.0% of the GDP.<ref name=LD2009-06-05/> There were 2,439,997 Internet users in March 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indotel.gob.do/component/option,com_docman/task,cat_view/gid,110/Itemid,757 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226134642/http://www.indotel.gob.do/component/option%2Ccom_docman/task%2Ccat_view/gid%2C110/Itemid%2C757 |archivedate=February 26, 2011 |title=Indicadores Telefonicos 2009 |accessdate=June 5, 2009 |work=Indotel |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

=== Electricity ===
{{Main|Electricity sector in the Dominican Republic}}
Electric power service has been unreliable since the Trujillo era, and as much as 75% of the equipment is that old. The country's antiquated power grid causes transmission losses that account for a large share of billed electricity from generators. The privatization of the sector started under a previous administration of Leonel Fernández.<ref name=coha>{{cite web|first=Claudia|last=Patterson|url=http://www.coha.org/2004/10/president-leonel-fernandez-friend-or-foe-of-reform/|title=President Leonel Fernández: Friend or Foe of Reform?|work=Council on Hemispheric Affairs|date=October 4, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107015518/http://www.coha.org/2004/10/president-leonel-fernandez-friend-or-foe-of-reform/|archivedate=November 7, 2008}}</ref> The recent investment in a "Santo Domingo–Santiago Electrical Highway" to carry 345&nbsp;kW power,<ref name=DT2009-04-29/> with reduced losses in transmission, is being heralded as a major capital improvement to the national grid since the mid-1960s.

During the Trujillo regime electrical service was introduced to many cities. Almost 95% of usage was not billed at all. Around half of the Dominican Republic's 2.1 million houses have no meters and most do not pay or pay a fixed monthly rate for their electric service.<ref name=DT2006-06-01/>

Household and general electrical service is delivered at 110 [[volt]]s alternating at 60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]]. Electrically powered items from the United States work with no modifications. The majority of the Dominican Republic has access to electricity. Tourist areas tend to have more reliable power, as do business, travel, healthcare, and vital infrastructure.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120117175316/http://www.cdeee.gov.do/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=791%3Aedesur-agrega-3500-familias-a-24-horas-de-luz&catid=6%3Anoticias&Itemid=2 EDESUR agrega 3,500 familias a 24 Horas de Luz].

The Catholic Church began to lose its strong dominance in the late 19th century. This was due to a lack of funding, priests, and support programs. During the same time, [[Protestant]] [[Evangelicalism]] began to gain a wider support "with their emphasis on personal responsibility and family rejuvenation, economic entrepreneurship, and biblical [[fundamentalism]]".<ref>Encyclopedia of World Cultures "Dominicans", http://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/christianity/roman-catholic-orders-and-missions/dominicans</ref> The Dominican Republic has two Catholic patroness saints: ''Nuestra Señora de la Altagracia'' (Our Lady Of High Grace) and ''Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes'' (Our Lady Of Mercy).

The Dominican Republic has historically granted extensive religious freedom. According to the [[United States Department of State]], "The constitution specifies that there is no state church and provides for freedom of religion and belief. A concordat with the Vatican designates Catholicism as the official religion and extends special privileges to the Catholic Church not granted to other religious groups. These include the legal recognition of church law, use of public funds to underwrite some church expenses, and complete exoneration from customs duties."<ref>United States Department of State, 2011 Report on International Religious Freedom – Dominican Republic, 30 July 2012, available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/502105c67d.html</ref> In the 1950s restrictions were placed upon churches by the government of Trujillo. Letters of protest were sent against the mass arrests of government adversaries. Trujillo began a campaign against the Catholic Church and planned to arrest priests and bishops who preached against the government. This campaign ended before it was put into place, with his assassination.

During World War II a group of Jews escaping [[Nazi Germany]] fled to the Dominican Republic and founded the city of [[Sosúa]]. It has remained the center of the Jewish population since.<ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Haggerty|title=Dominican Republic: A Country Study: Religion|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|year=1989|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/33.htm|accessdate=May 21, 2006}}</ref>

In addition, there are descendants of immigrants who came from other Caribbean islands, including [[St. Kitts and Nevis]], [[Antigua]], [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], [[Montserrat]], [[Tortola]], [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Croix]], [[St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], and [[Guadeloupe]]. They worked on sugarcane plantations and docks and settled mainly in the cities of [[San Pedro de Macorís]] and [[Puerto Plata (city)|Puerto Plata]]. Puerto Rican, and to a lesser extent, Cuban immigrants fled to the Dominican Republic from the mid-1800s until about 1940 due to a poor economy and social unrest in their respective home countries. Many Puerto Rican immigrants settled in [[Higüey (city)|Higüey]], among other cities, and quickly assimilated due to similar culture.

Haiti is the neighboring nation to the Dominican Republic and is considerably poorer, less developed and is additionally the least developed country in the western hemisphere. In 2003, 80% of all Haitians were poor (54% living in abject poverty) and 47.1% were illiterate. The country of nine million people also has a fast growing population, but over two-thirds of the labor force lack formal jobs.

Due to the lack of basic amenities and medical facilities in Haiti a large number of Haitian women, often arriving with several health problems, cross the border to Dominican soil. They deliberately come during their last weeks of pregnancy to obtain medical attention for childbirth, since Dominican public hospitals do not refuse medical services based on nationality or legal status. Statistics from a hospital in Santo Domingo report that over 22% of childbirths are by Haitian mothers.<ref name=LD2008-01-21/>

Haiti also [[Environmental issues in Haiti|suffers from severe environmental degradation]]. Deforestation is rampant in Haiti; today less than 4 percent of Haiti's forests remain, and in many places the soil has eroded right down to the bedrock.<ref>{{cite news|title=Dirt Poor&nbsp;— Haiti has lost its soil and the means to feed itself.|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/09/soil/bourne-text}}</ref> Haitians burn wood charcoal for 60% of their domestic energy production. Because of Haiti running out of plant material to burn, some Haitian bootleggers have created an illegal market for charcoal on the Dominican side. Conservative estimates calculate the illegal movement of 115 tons of charcoal per week from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. Dominican officials estimate that at least 10 trucks per week are crossing the border loaded with charcoal.<ref>{{cite web|title=The charcoal war|url=http://latinamericanscience.org/2014/03/the-charcoal-war/}}</ref>

{{Main|Dominican Americans|Dominican Republic immigration to Puerto Rico}}
The first of three late-20th century emigration waves began in 1961 after the assassination of dictator Trujillo,<ref name=Wilderotter/> due to fear of retaliation by Trujillo's allies and political uncertainty in general. In 1965 the United States began a military occupation of the Dominican Republic to end a civil war. Upon this, the U.S. eased travel restrictions, making it easier for Dominicans to obtain U.S. visas.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Morrison, Thomas K.  |author2=Sinkin, Richard|jstor=2546161|title=International Migration in the Dominican Republic|journal=International Migration Review|volume= 16|issue=4, Special Issue: International Migration and Development |date=Winter 1982|pages=819–836|doi=10.2307/2546161}}</ref> From 1966 to 1978, the exodus continued, fueled by high unemployment and political repression.

In the early 1980s, underemployment, inflation, and the rise in value of the dollar all contributed to a third wave of emigration from the Dominican Republic. Today, emigration from the Dominican Republic remains high.<ref name="Annenberg Foundation"/> In 2012 there were approximately 1.7 million people of Dominican descent in the U.S., counting both native- and foreign-born.<ref>[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?

=== Education ===
{{main|Education in the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Dominican kids in Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|Kids taking classes]]
Primary education is regulated by the Ministry of Education, with education being a right of all citizens and [[youth in the Dominican Republic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=LEY 66–97 Ley General de Educación|url=http://www.oas.org/juridico/spanish/mesicic2_repdom_sc_anexo_7_sp.pdf}}</ref>

Preschool education is organized in different cycles and serves the 2–4 age group and the 4–6 age group. Preschool education is not mandatory except for the last year. Basic education is compulsory and serves the population of the 6–14 age group. Secondary education is not compulsory, although it is the duty of the state to offer it for free.

=== Visual arts ===
Dominican art is perhaps most commonly associated with the bright, vibrant colors and images that are sold in every tourist gift shop across the country. However, the country has a long history of [[fine art]] that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.

Historically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]]. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Church and Convent Regina Angelorum CCSD 07 2018 0762.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Church and Convent, Colonial Santo Domingo.]]
The architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526|title=Colonial City of Santo Domingo|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&language=E|title=Dominican Republic National Commission for UNESCO|work=UNESCO|date=November 14, 1957|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.

The indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Taíno]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.

Lately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.

=== Cuisine ===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|Chicharrón mixto, common dish in the country derived from Andalusia in southern Spain.]]

Dominican cuisine is predominantly [[Spanish cuisine#Spanish regional variation: typical dishes and meal routines|Spanish]], [[Taíno#Food and agriculture|Taíno]], and [[African cuisine|African]]. The typical cuisine is quite similar to what can be found in other Latin American countries.<ref>https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/visit-dominican-republic/caribbean-culture/</ref> One breakfast dish consists of eggs and ''[[Mangú (dish)|mangú]]'' (mashed, boiled plantain). Heartier versions of ''mangú'' are accompanied by deep-fried meat (Dominican salami, typically), cheese, or both. Lunch, generally the largest and most important meal of the day, usually consists of rice, meat, beans, and  salad. "La Bandera" (literally "The Flag") is the most popular lunch dish; it consists of meat and red beans on white rice. ''[[Sancocho]]'' is a stew often made with seven varieties of meat.
[[File:Patacones.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Tostones, a fried plantain dish]]

Meals tend to favor meats and starches over dairy products and vegetables. Many dishes are made with ''[[sofrito]]'', which is a mix of local herbs used as a wet rub for meats and sautéed to bring out all of a dish's flavors. Throughout the south-central coast, [[bulgur]], or whole wheat, is a main ingredient in [[Tabbouleh|''quipes'' or ''tipili'']] (bulgur salad). Other favorite Dominican foods include ''[[chicharrón]]'', ''[[Cassava|yuca]]'', ''[[Tapioca|casabe]]'', ''[[Cuban pastry|pastelitos]]''<!--really?--> ([[empanada]]s), ''[[Sweet potato|batata]]'', [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], ''[[Pasteles|pasteles en hoja]]'', ''[[chimichurris]]'', and ''[[tostones]]''.

Some treats Dominicans enjoy are ''[[Rice pudding|arroz con leche]]'' (or ''arroz con dulce''), ''[[Bizcocho Dominicano|bizcocho dominicano]]'' (lit. Dominican cake), ''[[habichuelas con dulce]]'', [[flan]], ''[[Snow cone|frío frío]]'' (snow cones), [[dulce de leche]], and ''caña'' ([[sugarcane]]). The beverages Dominicans enjoy are ''[[Morir Soñando]]'', [[rum]], beer, ''[[Mama Juana]]'',<ref>[http://www.republicadominicana.net/4-bebidas-tipicas-de-republica-dominicana/ "Bebidas típicas de República Dominicana"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073748/http://www.republicadominicana.net/4-bebidas-tipicas-de-republica-dominicana/ |date=March 4, 2016 }}. ''RepublicaDominicana.net'' (in Spanish).</ref> ''batida'' (smoothie), jugos naturales (freshly squeezed fruit juices), ''[[Mauby|mabí]]'', coffee, and ''[[chaca (dessert)|chaca]]'' (also called ''maiz caqueao/casqueado'', ''maiz con dulce'' and ''maiz con leche''), the last item being found only in the southern provinces of the country such as San Juan.

=== Music and dance ===
{{Main|Music of the Dominican Republic}}
[[File:Merengue dancing.jpg|thumb|[[Merengue music|Merengue]] music genre is native to Dominican Republic]]
Musically, the Dominican Republic is known for the [[Popular culture|world popular]] [[musical style]] and genre called ''[[Merengue music|merengue]]'',<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|376–7}} a type of lively, fast-paced rhythm and dance music consisting of a tempo of about 120 to 160 beats per minute (though it varies) based on musical elements like drums, brass, chorded instruments, and accordion, as well as some elements unique to the Spanish-speaking Caribbean, such as the ''[[tambora (Dominican drum)|tambora]]'' and ''[[güira]]''.

Its [[Syncopation|syncopated beats]] use [[Latin percussion]], [[brass instruments]], bass, and piano or keyboard. Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron "Los Reyes del Merengue," Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], singer-songwriter [[Los Hermanos Rosario]], [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[Toño Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chichí Peralta]].

Merengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|375}} when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name="Harvey2006"/>{{rp|378}}
[[File:Juan Luis Guerra en Acceso Total (6).jpg|thumb|Dominican singer [[Juan Luis Guerra]] is an icon of the Merengue music genre]]
[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' ("bitterness," or "bitter music,"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.

[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies—usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days—as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.<ref>[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition]. iasorecords.com</ref>

[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.

[[Dominican rock]] is also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.

=== National symbols ===
[[File:Pereskia quisqueyana.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Bayahibe Rose]]

Some of the Dominican Republic's important symbols are the [[Flag of the Dominican Republic|flag]], [[Coat of arms of the Dominican Republic|the coat of arms]], and the national anthem, titled ''[[National Anthem of the Dominican Republic|Himno Nacional]]''. The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.<ref>
{{cite web |url=http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181033/http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |title=Ejército Nacional de la República Dominicana&nbsp;– Bandera Nacional |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |publisher=National Army of the Dominican Republic |language=Spanish}}</ref>

In the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, "Dios, Patria, Libertad" (meaning "God, Fatherland, Liberty"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, "República Dominicana" (meaning "Dominican Republic"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.

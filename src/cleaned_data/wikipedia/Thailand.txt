'''Thailand''' ({{lang-th|ประเทศไทย}}) ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|aɪ|l|æ|n|d|,_|-|l|ən|d}} {{respell|TY|land|,_-|lənd}}), officially the '''Kingdom of Thailand''' and formerly known as '''Siam''' ({{lang-th|สยาม}}), is a country at the center of the [[Southeast Asia]]n [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochinese peninsula]] composed of 76 [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]]. At {{convert|513,120|km2|abbr=on}} and over 68 million people, Thailand is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|50th largest country by total area]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|21st-most-populous country]]. The capital and largest city is [[Bangkok]], a special administrative area. Thailand is bordered to the north by [[Myanmar]] and [[Laos]], to the east by Laos and [[Cambodia]], to the south by the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]], and to the west by the [[Andaman Sea]] and the southern extremity of Myanmar. Its maritime boundaries include [[Vietnam]] in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and [[Indonesia]] and [[India]] on the Andaman Sea to the southwest. Although nominally a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]], the most recent [[2014 Thai coup d'état|coup in 2014]] established a [[de facto]] [[military dictatorship]].

[[Tai peoples]] migrated from southwestern China to mainland [[Southeast Asia]] from the 11th century; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Siamese'' dates to the 12th century. Various [[Indianised kingdoms]] such as the [[Mon kingdoms|Mon]], the [[Khmer Empire]] and [[Monarchies of Malaysia|Malay states]] ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as [[Ngoenyang]], the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], [[Lan Na]] and the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], which rivaled each other. European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, one of the great powers in the region. Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656–88), gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in 1767 [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–67)|in a war with Burma]]. [[Taksin]] quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. He was succeeded in 1782 by [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke]], the first monarch of the [[Chakri dynasty]] and founder of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]], which lasted into the early 20th century.

Through the 18th and 19th centuries, Siam faced pressure from France and the United Kingdom, including forced concessions of territory, but nevertheless it remained the only Southeast Asian country to avoid direct Western rule. Following a bloodless [[Siamese revolution of 1932|revolution in 1932]], Siam became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to "Thailand". While it joined the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies in World War I]], Thailand was an [[Thailand in World War II|Axis satellite]] in [[World War II]]. In the late 1950s, [[Sarit Thanarat|a military coup]] revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. Thailand became a [[Major non-NATO ally|major ally]] of the United States and played a [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|key anti-communist role in the region]]. Apart from a [[1973 Thai popular uprising|brief period of parliamentary democracy]] in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. In the 21st century, Thailand endured a political crisis that culminated in two coups and the establishment of its [[Constitution of Thailand#2017 Constitution|current and 20th constitution]] by the military junta.

Thailand  is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] under a [[Military dictatorship|military junta]]. Thailand is a founding member of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] and remains a major ally of the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/usmu003.asp|title=American foreign policy. 1950-1955; basic documents|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2321k|title=22 U.S. Code § 2321k - Designation of major non-NATO allies|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> Despite its comparatively sporadic changes in leadership, it is considered a [[regional power]] in Southeast Asia and a [[middle power]] in global affairs.<ref>Jonathan H.

=== Etymology of "Siam" ===

The country has always been called ''[[Mueang#Thailand|Mueang Thai]]'' by its citizens. By outsiders prior to 1949, it was usually known by the [[exonym]] ''Siam'' ({{lang-th|{{linktext|สยาม}}}} {{RTGS|Sayam}}, {{IPA-th|sajǎːm|pron}}, also spelled ''Siem'', ''Syâm'', or ''Syâma'').{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The word ''Siam'' may have originated from [[Pali]] (''suvaṇṇabhūmi'', “land of gold”) or [[Sanskrit]] श्याम (''śyāma'', “dark”) or [[Mon language|Mon]] ရာမည(''rhmañña'', “stranger”). The names ''[[Shan people|Shan]]'' and ''[[Ahom people|A-hom]]'' seem to be variants of the same word. The word ''Śyâma'' is possibly not its origin, but a learned and artificial distortion.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}<ref>{{cite book | author = Charles Eliot| title = The Project Gutenberg EBook of Hinduism and Buddhism, An Historical Sketch, Vol. 3 (of 3) [EBook #16847] | publisher = Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd. | year = 1921 | location = London | pages = Ch. xxxvii 1; citing in turn Footnote 189: The name is found on [[Champa]]n inscriptions of 1050 CE and according to Gerini appears in [[Ptolemy]]'s [[Geographia|Samarade]] = Sâmaraṭṭha. See Gerini, Ptolemy, p. 170. But Samarade is near Bangkok and there can hardly have been Thais there in Ptolemy's time; and Footnote 190: So too in Central Asia Kustana appears to be a learned distortion of the name [[Khotan]], made to give it a meaning in Sanskrit}}</ref> Another theory is the name derives from Chinese: "Ayutthaya emerged as a dominant centre in the late fourteenth century. The Chinese called this region Xian, which the Portuguese converted into Siam." (Baker and Phongpaichit, A History of Thailand, 8)
A further possibility is that [[Mon language|Mon]]-speaking peoples migrating south called themselves 'syem' as do the autochthonous [[Mon-Khmer]]-speaking inhabitants of the [[Malay Peninsula]].{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}
[[File:King Mongkut (Rama IV) of Siam Signature (English).svg|thumb|''SPPM Mongkut Rex Siamensium'', [[King Mongkut]]'s signature]]
The signature of King [[Mongkut]] (r. 1851–1868) reads ''SPPM'' (Somdet Phra Poramenthra Maha) ''Mongkut Rex Siamensium'' (Mongkut King of the Siamese), giving the name "Siam" official status until 24 June 1939 when it was changed to Thailand.<ref name="ThaiCSM">[http://www.csmngt.com/thailand_history.htm Thailand (Siam) History], CSMngt-Thai. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424080811/http://www.csmngt.com/thailand_history.htm |date=24 April 2015 }}</ref> Thailand was renamed to Siam from 1946 to 1948, after which it again reverted to Thailand.

=== Etymology of "Thailand" ===

According to [[George Cœdès]], the word ''Thai'' ({{linktext|ไทย}}) means "free man" in the Thai language, "differentiating the Thai from the natives encompassed in Thai society as serfs".{{sfn|Cœdès|1968|p=197}} A famous Thai scholar argued that Thai ({{lang|th|ไท}}) simply means "people" or "human being", since his investigation shows that in some rural areas the word "Thai" was used instead of the usual Thai word "khon" ({{linktext|คน}}) for people.<ref>{{lang|th|จิตร ภูมิศักดิ์ 1976: "ความเป็นมาของคำสยาม ไทย ลาวและขอม และลักษณะทางสังคม ของชื่อชนชาติ"}} (Jid Phumisak 1976: "Coming Into Existence for the Siamese Words for Thai, Laotian and Khmer and Societal Characteristics for Nation-names")</ref> According to [[Michel Ferlus]], the ethnonyms Thai/Tai (or Thay/Tay) would have evolved from the etymon '''*k(ə)ri:''' 'human being' through the following chain: '''*kəri:''' > '''*kəli:''' > '''*kədi:/*kədaj''' > '''*di:/*daj''' > '''*daj<sup>A</sup>''' (Proto-Southwestern Tai) > '''tʰaj<sup>A2</sup>''' (in [[Thai language|Siamese]] and [[Lao language|Lao]]) or > '''taj<sup>A2</sup>''' (in the other [[Southwestern Tai languages|Southwestern]] and [[Central Tai languages]] classified by [[Li Fang-Kuei|Li Fangkuei]]).<ref name="Michel Furles">[https://hal.inria.fr/halshs-01182596/document Ferlus, Michel (2009).

While Thai people will often refer to their country using the polite form ''prathet Thai'' ({{lang-th|ประเทศไทย}}), they most commonly use the more colloquial term ''mueang Thai'' ({{lang-th|เมืองไทย}}) or simply ''Thai;'' the word ''[[mueang]]'', archaically referring to a city-state, is commonly used to refer to a city or town as the centre of a region. ''Ratcha Anachak Thai'' ({{lang-th|ราชอาณาจักรไทย}}) means "kingdom of Thailand" or "kingdom of Thai". Etymologically, its components are: ''ratcha'' ({{lang-sa|राजन्}}, ''[[rājan]]'', "king, royal, realm"); ''-ana-'' ([[Pali]] ''āṇā'' "authority, command, power", itself from the Sanskrit {{lang|sa|आज्ञा}}, ''ājñā'', of the same meaning) ''-chak'' (from Sanskrit {{lang|sa|{{linktext|चक्र}}}} ''cakra-'' "wheel", a symbol of power and rule). The [[Thai National Anthem]] ({{lang-th|เพลงชาติ}}), written by [[Luang Saranupraphan]] during the extremely patriotic 1930s, refers to the Thai nation as ''prathet Thai'' ({{lang-th|ประเทศไทย}}).

=== Early states ===
{{Main|Initial states of Thailand}}

After the decline of the Khmer Empire and [[Pagan Kingdom|Kingdom of Pagan]] in the early 13th century, various states thrived in their place. The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the [[Malay peninsula]]. During the 13th century, Tai people have already settled in the core land of [[Dvaravati]] and [[Lavo Kingdom]] to [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]] in the south. There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais. Around 1240s, [[Si Inthrathit|Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao]], a local Tai ruler, rallied the people to rebel against the Khmer. He later crowned himself the first king of [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in 1238. Mainstream Thai historians count Sukhothai as the first kingdom of Thai people. Sukhothai expanded furthest during the reign of [[Ram Khamhaeng]] (1279–98). However, it was mostly a network of local lords who swore fealty to Sukhothai, not directly controlled by it. He is believed to invent [[Thai script]] and Thai ceramics was an important export goods in his era. Sukhothai embraced [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] in the reign of [[Maha Thammaracha I]] (1347–68).

To the north, [[Mangrai]] who descended from a local ruler linage of [[Ngoenyang]], founded the kingdom of [[Lan Na]] in 1292, centered in [[Chiang Mai]]. He unified the surrounding area and his dynasty would rule the kingdom continuously for the next two centuries. He also created a network of state through political alliance to the east and north of [[Mekong]]. While in the port in Lower Chao Phraya Basin, a federation around [[Phetchaburi]], [[Suphan Buri]], [[Lopburi]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] area was created in the 11th century.

=== Ayutthaya Kingdom ===

{{Main|Ayutthaya Kingdom|Thonburi Kingdom}}

[[File:Southeast Asian history - Around 1540.png|alt=Southeast Asia around 1540|left|thumb|Ayutthaya's zone of influence and neighbours, c. 1540]]
According to the most widely accepted version of its origin, Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby [[Lavo Kingdom]] and Suvarnabhumi with [[Uthong]] as its first king. Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the king of Ayutthaya under [[Mandala (political model)|mandala system]]. Its initial expansion is through conquest and political marriage. Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded Khmer Empire twice and sacked its capital [[Angkor]]. Ayutthaya then became a regional great power in place of Khmer Empire. Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and was finally incorporated in to the kingdom. [[Borommatrailokkanat]] brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called ''[[Sakdina]]'', where common male was conscripted into [[corvée]] for six months a year. Ayutthaya was interested in [[Malay peninsula]] but failed to conquer [[Malacca Sultanate]] which was supported by Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]].

European contact and trade started in the early 16th century, with the [[Duarte Fernandes|envoy]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] duke [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1511, followed by the French, Dutch, and English. Rivalry for supremacy over Chiang Mai and Mon people pitted Ayutthaya against Burmese Kingdom. Multiple war with its ruling dynasty [[Taungoo Dynasty]] starting in the 1540s in the reign of [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]] were ultimately ended with [[Burmese–Siamese War (1568–70)|capture of the capital in 1570]]. Then was a period of brief vassalage to Burma until [[Naresuan]] proclaimed independence in 1584.

[[File:AMH-5626-NA Bird's eye view of the city of Judja.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Johannes Vingboons]] of Ayutthaya, c. 1665]]
Ayutthaya then seek to improve relations with European powers for many successive reigns. The kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656–88) where some European travelers regarded Ayutthaya as Asian great powers alongside China and India.<ref name="chris"/>{{rp|ix}} However, growing French influence later in his reign was met with nationalist sentiment and led eventually to the [[Siamese revolution of 1688|revolution of 1688]]. However, overall relations remain stable with French missionaries still active in preaching Christianity.

After that, there was a period of relative peace but the kingdom's influence gradually waned, partly because of bloody struggles over each succession, until the capital Ayutthaya was [[Burmese–Siamese War (1765–67)|utterly destroyed in 1767]] by Burma's new [[Alaungpaya]] dynasty. Anarchy followed destruction of the former capital, with its territories split into five different factions, each controlled by a warlord. [[Taksin]] rose to power and proclaimed [[Thonburi]] as temporary capital in the same year. He also quickly subdued the other warlords. His forces engaged in wars with Burma, Laos, and Cambodia, which successfully drove the Burmese out of Lan Na in 1775, captured [[Vientiane]] in 1778 and tried to install a pro-Thai king in Cambodia in the 1770s. In his final years there was a coup which was caused by his supposedly "insanity," and eventually Taksin and his sons were executed by longtime companion General [[Rama I|Chao Phraya Chakri]] (future Rama I). He was the first king of the ruling [[Chakri Dynasty]] and founder of [[Bangkok]] ([[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]) on April 6, 1782.

=== Modernization and centralization ===
{{Main|Rattanakosin Kingdom}}
[[File:ThailandWithFlags.gif|thumb|Siamese territorial concessions to Britain and France by year]]

Under [[Rama I]] (1782–1809), Rattanakosin successfully defended against Burmese attacks and put an end to Burmese invasion. He also created overlordship over large portions of Laos and Cambodia. In 1821, [[John Crawfurd]] was sent on a mission to negotiate a new trade agreement with Siam — the first sign of an issue which was to dominate 19th-century Siamese politics.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=7813138|title=The Crawford Papers — A Collection of Official Records relating to the Mission of Dr. John Crawfurd sent to Siam by the Government of India in the year 1821 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=324–325 |date=1971|journal=Cambridge.org|accessdate=27 September 2015|doi=10.1017/S0022463400019421 |last1=Hwa |first1=Cheng Siok }}</ref> Bangkok signed [[Burney Treaty]] in 1826, after the British victory in [[First Anglo-Burmese War]]. [[Anouvong]] of Vientiane, who misunderstood that Britain was about to attack Bangkok, started the [[Lao rebellion (1826–28)|Lao rebellion]] in 1826 and was defeated. Vientiane was destroyed and a large number of Lao people was relocated to [[Khorat Plateau]] as the result. Bangkok also waged [[Siamese–Vietnamese wars|multiple wars with Vietnam]], where Bangkok successfully regained influence over Cambodia.

[[File:King and Tsar.jpg|210px|thumb|left|King [[Chulalongkorn]] with Tsar [[Nicholas II]] in Saint Petersburg, during his first Grand Tour in 1897]]

Since the late 19th century, Siam tried to subdue the ethnic groups in the realm as colony. In the reign of [[Mongkut]] (1851–68), who recognized the threat of Western powers, the court contacted the British government directly to defuse the tension. A British mission led by Sir [[John Bowring]], Governor of Hong Kong, led to the conclusion of [[Bowring Treaty]], first of many [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] with Western countries. It, however, brought economic development in Bangkok and international trade. The unexpected death of Mongkut by [[malaria]] led to succession by young [[Chulalongkorn|Prince Chulalongkorn]] and [[Somdet Chaophraya Sri Suriwongse]] (Chuang Bunnag) acted as a regent.

Chulalongkorn (r. 1868–1910) initiated centralization, set up a privy council, and abolished slavery and [[corvée]] system. [[Front Palace crisis]] of 1874 stalled reformation attempt. In the 1870s and 1880s, he incorporated the protectorate up north into the kingdom proper, which later expanded to the protectorate in the northeast and the south. He established twelve ''krom'' in 1888, which was equivalent to present-day ministries. [[Franco-Siamese War|Crisis of 1893]] which was caused by French demands of Laotian territory east of Mekong. France and Britain agreed between themselves to make Siam [[buffer state]]. It was not until the 20th century can Siam renegotiate every unequal treaty since Bowring treaty, including [[extraterritoriality]], but had to pay with many territorial exchanges. The advent of monthon system marked the creation of modern nation-state. In 1905, there was rebellions in ancient Pattani area, Ubon Ratchathani and Phrae to oppose an attempt to subdue the power of local ruling lords.

[[Palace Revolt of 1912]] was a failed attempt by Western-educated military officers who aimed to overthrow absolute monarchy. [[Vajiravudh]] (r. 1910–25) responded by propaganda for the entirety of his reign. He promoted the [[Thaification|idea of Thai nation]]. In 1917, Siam joined [[World War I]] on the side of [[Allies of World War I|the Allies]] because there were concerns that the Allies may react to neutral countries and desire to amend past unequal treaties. In the aftermath Siam joined [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], gained freedom of taxation and cancellation of extraterritoriality.

=== Constitutional monarchy, World War II, and Cold War ===
{{Main|Thailand in World War II|History of Thailand (1932–73)}}
The [[Siamese revolution of 1932|bloodless revolution]] took place in 1932, carried out by the [[Khana Ratsadon]] group of military and civilian officials resulted in a transition of power, when [[Prajadhipok]] was forced to grant the people of Siam their first constitution, thereby ending centuries of [[absolute monarchy]]. It was the combined results of economic hardship felt by the [[Great Depression]], sharply fell rice price and significantly reduction in public spending causing discontent among aristocrats. In 1933, [[Boworadet rebellion|A counter-revolutionary rebellion]] occurred which aimed to reinstate absolute monarchy but failed. Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to abdication. The government selected [[Ananda Mahidol]], who was studying in Switzerland, to be the new king.

Later that decade, the military wing of Khana Ratsadon came to dominate Siamese politics. [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] who became premier in 1938, started political oppression and took openly anti-royalist stance. His government adopted nationalism and Westernization, anti-Chinese and anti-French policies. In 1940, there was a decree changing the name of the country from "Siam" to "Thailand." In 1941, Thailand was in [[French–Thai War|a brief conflict]] with [[Vichy France]] resulting in Thailand gained Laotian and Cambodian territories until the war ends. On December 8, 1941 Japan invaded Thailand and the government quickly agreed to join military alliance with Japan. The government also declare war on the United States and the United Kingdom. [[Free Thai Movement]] was launched both in Thailand and abroad to oppose the government and Japanese occupation. After the war ends in 1945 Thailand signed formal agreement to end the state of war with [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]]. Most Allied powers did not recognize Thailand's declaration of war.

[[File:King Rama IX being presented with regalia at coronation.jpg|thumb|150px|Coronation of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]].]]
In June 1946, young King Ananda was found dead under mysterious circumstances. His younger brother [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] succeeded the throne. Thailand signed [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) to became an active ally of the United States since 1954. Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]] launched a coup in 1957, which removed Khana Ratsadon from politics. His rule was autocratic; he built his legitimacy around the god-like status of the monarch and by channeling the government's loyalty to the king. His government improved the country's infrastructure and education. After the US joined [[Vietnam War]] in 1961, there was a secret agreement where the US promised to protect Thailand.

The period brought about increasing [[modernisation]] and [[Westernisation]]. Internal conflict regarding economic difficulties which began in 1968 led to [[1973 Thai popular uprising]], an important event in Thai modern history.

=== Contemporary history ===
{{Main|History of Thailand (1973–2001)|History of Thailand since 2001}}

Constant unrest and instability, as well as fear of communist takeover after [[Fall of Saigon]], made some ultra-right groups brand increasingly leftist students as communists. This culminated in [[Thammasat University massacre]] in October 1976. A coup d'état on that very day brought Thailand a new ultra-right government, which oppressed many media outlets, officials, and intellectuals, and fueled the [[Communist insurgency in Thailand|Communist insurgency]] further. Another coup in the following year installed a more moderate government, which offered amnesty to communist fighters in 1978. The Party abandoned the insurgency by 1983. Thailand had its first elected Prime Minister in 1988.<ref name="bri31">{{cite web |url= https://www.britannica.com/place/Thailand/The-postwar-crisis-and-the-return-of-Phibunsongkhram#ref52686 |title= Partial democracy and the search for a new political order |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' |publisher= |access-date=11 March 2018 |quote=}}</ref>

The [[1997 Asian financial crisis]] originated in Thailand and forced the country to take an [[IMF]] loan with unpopular provisions. The populist [[Thai Rak Thai]] party, led by prime minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], governed from 2001 until 2006.<ref>{{cite news |title=Profile: Thaksin Shinawatra |publisher=BBC |date=21 October 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1108114.stm}}</ref> A [[South Thailand insurgency]] escalated starting from 2004.

[[File:Meeting with Prime Minister of Thailand Yingluck Shinawatra and Vladimir Putin 01.jpg|thumb|Thailand's Prime Minister [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] was removed from office on 7 May 2014 by a controversial Constitutional Court decision.]]
Prior to 1932, all legislative powers were vested in the monarch. This had been the case since the foundation of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in the 12th century as the king was seen as a "Dharmaraja" or "king who rules in accordance with [[Dharma]]", (the Buddhist law of righteousness). Modern [[absolute monarchy]] was established by Chulalongkorn when he transformed the decentralized protectorate system into a unitary state. On 24 June 1932, [[Khana Ratsadon]] (People's Party) carried out a bloodless revolution which ended the absolute rule.

The politics of Thailand is conducted within the framework of a [[constitutional monarchy]], whereby the [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]] and a [[Hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarch]] is [[head of state]]. The [[judiciary]] is supposed to be independent of the executive and the legislative branches, although judicial rulings are suspected of being based on political considerations rather than on existing law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2014/05/17/thailands-juristocracy/|title=Thailand's juristocracy – New Mandala|date=17 May 2014|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905162923/http://asiapacific.anu.edu.au/newmandala/2014/05/17/thailands-juristocracy/|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, since May 2014, Thailand has been ruled by a [[military junta]], the [[National Council for Peace and Order]].

The legislative branch under the 2007 Constitution was the [[bicameral]] [[National Assembly of Thailand|National Assembly]] composed of the [[Senate of Thailand|Senate]], the 150-member [[upper house]], and [[House of Representatives of Thailand|House of Representatives]], the 350-member [[lower house]]. Since 2014 coup, it was replaced by a [[Rubber stamp (politics)|rubber stamp]], [[unicameral]] [[National Legislative Assembly of Thailand (2014)|National Legislative Assembly]].

The current King of Thailand is [[Vajiralongkorn]] (or Rama X) since October 2016. Under the constitution the powers of the king are limited and he is primarily a symbol of the Thai nation. As the [[head of state]], he is given some powers and has a role to play in the workings of government. According to the constitution, the king is head of the [[Royal Thai Armed Forces|armed forces]]. He is required to be Buddhist as well as the defender of all faiths in the country. The king also retained some traditional powers such as the power to appoint his heirs, the power to grant pardons, and the [[Royal Assent|royal assent]].

Since the 2000s, two political parties dominated Thai general elections: one was [[Pheu Thai Party]] (which was a successor of [[People's Power Party (Thailand)|People's Power Party]] and [[Thai Rak Thai Party]] respectively) and the other was [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]].

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Thailand}}
[[File:Nan z doi phuka 2006 1003.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Luang Prabang Range]], which straddles the Thai-Lao border, in [[Nan Province]], [[Northern Thailand]]]]

Totalling {{convert|513120|km2}},<ref name=CIA /> Thailand is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|50th-largest country]] by total area. It is slightly smaller than [[Yemen]] and slightly larger than [[Spain]].

Thailand comprises several distinct geographic regions, partly corresponding to the provincial groups. The north of the country is the mountainous area of the [[Thai highlands]], with the highest point being [[Doi Inthanon]] in the [[Thanon Thong Chai Range]] at {{Convert|2565|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The northeast, [[Isan]], consists of the [[Khorat Plateau]], bordered to the east by the [[Mekong River]]. The centre of the country is dominated by the predominantly flat [[Chao Phraya]] river valley, which runs into the [[Gulf of Thailand]].
[[File:Thailand 06 - 40 Railay (158632937).jpg|thumb|A typical limestone island in Thailand]]

Southern Thailand consists of the narrow [[Kra Isthmus]] that widens into the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Politically, there are six geographical regions which differ from the others in population, basic resources, natural features, and level of social and economic development. The diversity of the regions is the most pronounced attribute of Thailand's physical setting.

The Chao Phraya and the Mekong River are the indispensable water courses of rural Thailand. Industrial scale production of crops use both rivers and their tributaries. The Gulf of Thailand covers {{convert|320000|km2|-3}} and is fed by the Chao Phraya, [[Mae Klong River|Mae Klong]], [[Bang Pakong River|Bang Pakong]], and [[Tapi River, Thailand|Tapi]] Rivers. It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the Kra Isthmus. The eastern shore of the Gulf of Thailand is an industrial centre of Thailand with the kingdom's premier deepwater port in [[Sattahip District|Sattahip]] and its busiest commercial port, [[Laem Chabang]].
[[File:Isla Phi Phi Lay, Tailandia, 2013-08-19, DD 04.JPG|thumb|[[Phi Phi Islands]]]]
The [[Andaman Sea]] is a precious natural resource as it hosts the most popular and luxurious resorts in Asia. [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], [[Krabi]], [[Ranong]], [[Phang Nga]] and [[Trang Province|Trang]], and their islands, all lay along the coasts of the Andaman Sea and, despite the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|2004 tsunami]], they remain a tourist magnet for visitors from around the world.

Plans have resurfaced for [[Thai Canal|a canal]] which would connect the Andaman Sea to the Gulf of Thailand, analogous to the [[Suez Canal|Suez]] and the [[Panama Canal]]s. The idea has been greeted positively by Thai politicians as it would cut fees charged by the [[Port of Singapore|Ports of Singapore]], improve ties with China and India, lower shipping times, and eliminate pirate attacks in the [[Strait of Malacca]], and support the Thai government's policy of being the logistical hub for Southeast Asia. The canal, it is claimed, would improve economic conditions in the south of Thailand, which relies heavily on tourism income, and it would also change the structure of the Thai economy by making it an Asia logistical hub. The canal would be a major engineering project and has an expected cost of US$20–30 billion.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Thailand map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|left|Thailand map of Köppen climate classification]]

Thailand's climate is influenced by monsoon winds that have a seasonal character (the southwest and northeast monsoon).<ref name=tmd>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmd.go.th/en/archive/thailand_climate.pdf|title=The Climate of Thailand|publisher=Thai Meteorological Department|accessdate=18 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801225446/http://www.tmd.go.th/en/archive/thailand_climate.pdf|archivedate=1 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>{{rp|2}} The southwest monsoon, which starts from May until October is characterized by movement of warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean to Thailand, causing abundant rain over most of the country.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} The northeast monsoon, starting from October until February brings cold and dry air from China over most of Thailand.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} In southern Thailand, the northeast monsoon brings mild weather and abundant rainfall on the eastern coast of that region.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} Most of Thailand has a "tropical wet and dry or savanna climate" type ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]'s [[Tropical savanna climate]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tropical Savannas|url=https://php.radford.edu/~swoodwar/biomes/?page_id=105|work=Biomes of the World|publisher=S.

Thailand is divided into three seasons.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} The first is the rainy or southwest monsoon season (mid–May to mid–October) which prevails over most of the country.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} This season is characterized by abundant rain with August and September being the wettest period of the year.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} This can occasionally lead to floods.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|4}} In addition to rainfall caused by the southwest monsoon, the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ)  and tropical [[cyclones]] also contribute to producing heavy rainfall during the rainy season.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} Nonetheless, dry spells commonly occur for 1 to 2 weeks from June to early July.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|4}} This is due to the northward movement of the Intertropical Convergence Zone to southern China.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|4}} Winter or the northeast monsoon starts from mid–October until mid–February.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} Most of Thailand experiences dry weather during this season with mild temperatures.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}}{{rp|4}} The exception is the southern parts of Thailand where it receives abundant rainfall, particularly during October to November.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|2}} Summer or the pre–monsoon season runs from mid–February until mid–May and is characterized by warmer weather.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|3}}

Due to its inland nature and latitude, the north, northeast, central and eastern parts of Thailand experience a long period of warm weather.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|3}} During the hottest time of the year (March to May), temperatures usually reach up to {{convert|40|°C|°F}} or more with the exception of coastal areas where sea breezes moderate afternoon temperatures.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|3}} In contrast, outbreaks of cold air from China can bring colder temperatures; in some cases (particularly the north and northeast) close to or below {{convert|0|°C|°F}}.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|3}} Southern Thailand is characterized by mild weather year-round with less diurnal and seasonal variations in temperatures due to maritime influences.<ref name=tmd />{{rp|3}}

=== Environment ===
Thailand has a mediocre but improving performance in the global [[Environmental Performance Index]] (EPI) with an overall ranking of 91 out of 180 countries in 2016. This is also a mediocre rank in the [[Asia Pacific]] region specifically, but ahead of countries like Indonesia and China. The EPI was established in 2001 by the [[World Economic Forum]] as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. The environmental areas where Thailand performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) are [[air quality]] (167), environmental effects of the agricultural industry (106) and the [[climate and energy]] sector (93), the later mainly because of a high [[CO2 emission]] per KWh produced. Thailand performs best (i.e. lowest ranking) in [[water resource management]] (66), with some major improvements expected for the future too, and [[sanitation]] (68).<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://epi.yale.edu/reports/2016-report|title=2016 Report|journal=EPI Report|accessdate=17 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204021925/http://epi.yale.edu/reports/2016-report|archivedate=4 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>EPI (2016): [http://epi.yale.edu/country/thailand Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227041212/http://epi.yale.edu/country/thailand |date=27 December 2016 }}</ref>

Poaching of protected species remains a major problem. Hunters have decimated the populations of [[tigers]], [[leopards]], and other large cats for their valuable pelts. Many animals (including tigers, bears, [[crocodile]]s, and [[king cobra]]s) are farmed or hunted for their meat, which is considered a delicacy, and for their supposed medicinal properties. Although such trade is illegal, the famous Bangkok market [[Chatuchak Weekend Market|Chatuchak]] is still known for the sale of endangered species.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monitor.net/monitor/9702a/endangeredfood.html |title=Endangered Animals on Restaurant Menus |author=Teena Amrit Gill |publisher=Albion Monitor/News |date=18 February 1997 |accessdate=7 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516023649/https://www.monitor.net/monitor/9702a/endangeredfood.html |archivedate=16 May 2007 |df= }}</ref>

The practice of keeping wild animals as pets threatens several species. Baby animals are typically captured and sold, which often requires killing the mother. Once in captivity and out of their natural habitat, many pets die or fail to reproduce. Affected populations include the [[Asiatic black bear]], [[Malayan sun bear]], [[Lar gibbon|white-handed lar]], [[pileated gibbon]] and [[binturong]].<ref name="tscwa">{{cite web|url=http://www.tscwa.org/forests/index.html|title=Thai Forests: Dept.

== Administrative divisions ==
{{Main|Organization of the government of Thailand|Provinces of Thailand}}
Thailand is divided into 76<!--not 77, Bangkok is not a province, see next sentence!--> [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]] ({{lang|th|จังหวัด}}, changwat), which are gathered into five groups of provinces by location. There are also two specially-governed districts: the capital [[Bangkok]] (Krung Thep Maha Nakhon) and [[Pattaya]]. Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province.

Each province is divided into [[amphoe|districts]] and the districts are further divided into sub-districts (tambons). {{As of|2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://multi.dopa.go.th/pab/news/cate9/view46|title=Statistics of Administrative Divisions, Provincial Affairs Bureau|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> there were 878 [[Amphoe|districts (อำเภอ, amphoe)]] and the 50 [[districts of Bangkok]] ({{lang|th|เขต}}, khet), which is further divided into 7,255 [[Tambon|subdistricts ({{lang|th|ตำบล}}, tambon)]] in the 76 provinces or [[Khwaeng|Bangkok's subdistricts (แขวง, khwaeng)]]. Some parts of the provinces bordering Bangkok are also referred to as [[Bangkok Metropolitan Area|Greater Bangkok]] ({{lang|th|ปริมณฑล}}, pari monthon). These provinces include [[Nonthaburi Province|Nonthaburi]], [[Pathum Thani Province|Pathum Thani]], [[Samut Prakan Province|Samut Prakan]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province|Nakhon Pathom]] and [[Samut Sakhon Province|Samut Sakhon]]. The name of each province's capital city ({{lang|th|เมือง}}, mueang) is the same as that of the province. For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province (''Changwat Chiang Mai'') is ''Mueang Chiang Mai'' or ''Chiang Mai''.

=== Regions ===
[[File:Thailand four regions.svg|thumb|Thailand four-region division]]
{{Main|Regions of Thailand}}
Thai provinces are administrated by regions. The regions that Thailand uses to divide the provinces is the four-region division system. It divides the country into the four regions:
[[Northern Thailand]], [[Northeastern Thailand]], [[Central Thailand]]
and [[Southern Thailand]]. Each region has its own different historical background, culture, language and people.

In contrast to the [[administrative division]]s of the [[Provinces of Thailand]], Thailand is a [[Unitary state]], the provincial Governors, district chiefs, and district clerks are appointed by the central government. The regions themselves do not have an administrative character, but are used for [[geography of Thailand|geographical]], [[Statistics|statistical]], [[geology|geological]], [[meteorology|meteorological]] or [[tourism|touristic]] purposes.

=== Southern region ===
{{See also|South Thailand insurgency}}
[[File:Souththailandmap.GIF|thumb|left|Southern provinces of Thailand showing the Malay-Muslim majority areas]]

Thailand controlled the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far south as Malacca in the 15th century and held much of the peninsula, including Temasek (Singapore), some of the [[Andaman Islands]], and a colony on [[Java]], but eventually contracted when the British used force to guarantee their [[suzerainty]] over the sultanate.

Mostly the northern states of the Malay Sultanate presented annual gifts to the Thai king in the form of a [[Bunga mas|golden flower]]—a gesture of tribute and an acknowledgement of vassalage. The British intervened in the Malay State and with the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|Anglo-Siamese Treaty]] tried to build a railway from the south to Bangkok. Thailand relinquished sovereignty over what are now the northern Malay provinces of [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]], [[Kelantan]], and [[Terengganu]] to the British. Satun and Pattani Provinces were given to Thailand.

The Malay peninsular provinces were occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and infiltrated by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (CPM) from 1942 to 2008, when they sued for peace with the Malaysian and Thai governments after the CPM lost its support from [[Vietnam]] and China subsequent to the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Recent insurgent uprisings may be a continuation of separatist fighting which started after World War II with Sukarno's support for the [[Patani United Liberation Organisation|PULO]].  Most victims since the uprisings have been Buddhist and Muslim bystanders.

== Foreign relations ==

[[File:Royal Thai Embassy Wellington New Zealand 2015.JPG|thumb|Royal Thai Embassy in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]
The foreign relations of Thailand are handled by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Thailand participates fully in international and regional organisations. It is a [[major non-NATO ally]] and Priority Watch List [[Special 301 Report]] of the United States. The country remains an active member of ASEAN [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. Thailand has developed increasingly close ties with other ASEAN members: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, whose foreign and economic ministers hold annual meetings. Regional co-operation is progressing in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters. In 2003, Thailand served as [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) host. Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, currently serves as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In 2005 Thailand attended the inaugural East Asia Summit.

In recent years, Thailand has taken an increasingly active role on the international stage. When [[East Timor]] gained independence from Indonesia, Thailand, for the first time in its history, contributed troops to the international peacekeeping effort. Its troops remain there today as part of a UN peacekeeping force. As part of its effort to increase international ties, Thailand has reached out to such regional organisations as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Thailand has contributed troops to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Thaksin initiated negotiations for several [[free trade agreement]]s with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US. The latter especially was criticised, with claims that uncompetitive Thai industries could be wiped out.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ftawatch.org/ |title=FTA Watch Group website |publisher=Ftawatch.org |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822090332/http://www.ftawatch.org/ |archivedate=22 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Abhisit appointed Peoples Alliance for Democracy leader Kasit Piromya as foreign minister. In April 2009, fighting broke out between Thai and Cambodian troops on territory immediately adjacent to the 900-year-old ruins of Cambodia's [[Preah Vihear Temple|Preah Vihear]] Hindu temple near the border. The Cambodian government claimed its army had killed at least four Thais and captured 10 more, although the Thai government denied that any Thai soldiers were killed or injured. Two Cambodian and three Thai soldiers were killed.

According to the constitution, serving in the armed forces is a duty of all Thai citizens.<ref>[[s:2007 Constitution of Thailand#Chapter 4: Duties of the Thai People|Chapter 4 of the 2007 Constitution of Thailand]]</ref> However, only males over the age of 21, who have not gone through reserve training of the [[Territorial Defence Student]], are given the option of volunteering for the armed forces, or participating in the random draft. The candidates are subjected to varying lengths of training, from six months to two years of full-time service, depending on their education, whether they have partially completed the reserve training course, and whether they volunteered prior to the draft date (usually 1 April every year).

Candidates with a recognised bachelor's degree serve one year of full-time service if they are conscripted, or six months if they volunteer with the military officer at their district office (สัสดี, ''satsadi''). Likewise, the training length is also reduced for those who have partially completed the three-year reserve training course of the Territorial Defence Students (ร.ด., ''ro do''). A person who completed one year out of three will only have to serve full-time for one year. Those who completed two years of reserve training will only have to do six months of full-time training, while those who complete three years or more of reserve training will be exempted entirely.

Teaching relies heavily on [[rote learning]] rather than on student-centred methodology. The establishment of reliable and coherent curricula for its primary and secondary schools is subject to such rapid changes that schools and their teachers are not always sure what they are supposed to be teaching, and authors and publishers of textbooks are unable to write and print new editions quickly enough to keep up with the volatility. Issues concerning university entrance has been in constant upheaval for a number of years. Nevertheless, Thai education has seen its greatest progress in the years since 2001.

=== Recent economic history ===

[[File:MahaNakhon by kylehase.jpg|right|thumb|The [[MahaNakhon]] skyscraper in Bangkok, once the tallest in Thailand]]
Thailand experienced the world's highest economic growth rate from 1985 to 1996 – averaging 12.4% annually. In 1997 increased pressure on the [[Thai baht|baht]], a year in which the economy contracted by 1.9%, led to a crisis that uncovered financial sector weaknesses and forced the [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] administration to [[Floating exchange rate|float the currency]]. Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was forced to resign after his cabinet came under fire for its slow response to the economic crisis. The baht was pegged at 25 to the US dollar from 1978 to 1997. The baht reached its lowest point of 56 to the US dollar in January 1998 and the economy contracted by 10.8% that year, triggering the [[Asian financial crisis]].

Thailand's economy started to recover in 1999, expanding 4.2–4.4% in 2000, thanks largely to strong exports. Growth (2.2%) was dampened by the softening of the global economy in 2001, but picked up in the subsequent years owing to strong growth in Asia, a relatively weak baht encouraging exports, and increased domestic spending as a result of several mega projects and incentives of Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], known as [[Thaksinomics]]. Growth in 2002, 2003, and 2004 was 5–7% annually.

Growth in 2005, 2006, and 2007 hovered around 4–5%. Due both to the weakening of the US dollar and an increasingly strong Thai currency, by March 2008 the dollar was hovering around the 33 baht mark. While Thaksinomics has received criticism, official economic data reveals that between 2001 and 2011, Isan's GDP per capita more than doubled to US$1,475, while, over the same period, GDP in the Bangkok area increased from US$7,900 to nearly US$13,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thai northeast vows poll payback to Shinawatra clan|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iMeE4IHFr1q7Rr-eX5J1UmL3gcZQ?docId=b69c47e3-e4f5-4c32-8679-3d7ce5f040a3|accessdate=8 February 2014|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=31 January 2014|author=Aidan Jones}}</ref>

With the instability surrounding major 2010 protests, the GDP growth of Thailand settled at around 4–5%, from highs of 5–7% under the previous civilian administration. Political uncertainty was identified as the primary cause of a decline in investor and consumer confidence. The IMF predicted that the Thai economy would rebound strongly from the low 0.1% GDP growth in 2011, to 5.5% in 2012 and then 7.5% in 2013, due to the monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand, as well as a package of fiscal stimulus measures introduced by the former [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |title=Thailand Economy To Rebound Strongly In 2012 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |author=Phisanu Phromchanya |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015133916/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Exports and manufacturing ===

[[File:Thailand Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.15|A proportional representation of Thailand's exports]]
The economy of Thailand is heavily export-dependent, with exports accounting for more than two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP). Thailand exports over US$105 billion worth of goods and services annually.<ref name=CIA /> Major exports include cars, computers, electrical appliances, [[Rice production in Thailand|rice]], textiles and footwear, fishery products, rubber, and jewellery.<ref name=CIA />

Substantial industries include electric appliances, components, computer components, and vehicles.

[[Rail transport in Bangkok]] includes long-distance services, and some daily commuter trains running from and to the outskirts of the city during the rush hour, but passenger numbers have remained low. There are also three rapid transit rail systems in the capital.

As of 2012, Thailand had 103 airports with 63 paved runways, in addition to 6 heliports. The busiest airport in the county is Bangkok's [[Suvarnabhumi Airport]].

Thailand has 390,000&nbsp;km (242,335 miles) of highways.<ref name="NAR-20170123"/> According to the [[BBC]] Thailand has 462,133 roads and many multi-lane highways. {{Asof|2017}} Thailand has 37 million registered vehicles, 20 million of them motorbikes.

A number of undivided two-lane highways have been converted into divided four-lane highways. A Bangkok - [[Chonburi (city)|Chon Buri]] motorway (Route 7) now links to the new airport and [[Eastern Seaboard of Thailand|Eastern Seaboard]].

Asian tourists primarily visit Thailand for Bangkok and the historical, natural, and cultural sights in its vicinity. Western tourists not only visit Bangkok and surroundings, but in addition many travel to the southern beaches and islands. The north is the chief destination for trekking and [[adventure travel]] with its diverse ethnic minority groups and forested mountains. The region hosting the fewest tourists is [[Isan]] in the northeast. To accommodate foreign visitors, the Thai government established a separate tourism police with offices in the major tourist areas and its own central emergency telephone number.<ref>[http://www.amazing-thailand.com/Police.html Tourist Police in Thailand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703161503/http://www.amazing-thailand.com/Police.html |date=3 July 2008 }}.

Thailand produces roughly one-third of the oil it consumes. It is the second largest importer of oil in SE Asia. Thailand is a large producer of natural gas, with reserves of at least 10 trillion cubic feet. After Indonesia, it is the largest coal producer in SE Asia, but must import additional coal to meet domestic demand.

=== Informal economy ===
Thailand has an diverse and robust informal labor sector—in 2012, it was estimated that informal workers comprised 62.6% of the Thai workforce. The Ministry of Labor defines informal workers to be individuals who work in informal economies and do not have employee status under a given country's Labor Protection Act (LPA). The informal sector in Thailand has grown significantly over the past 60 years over the course of Thailand's gradual transition from an agriculture-based economy to becoming more industrialized and service-oriented.<ref name=":2">Kongtip, Pornpimol et al. “Informal Workers in Thailand: Occupational Health and Social Security Disparities.” ''New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS'' 25.2 (2015): 189–211. ''PMC''. Web. 12 Mar. 2018.</ref> Between 1993–1995, ten percent of the Thai labor force moved from the agricultural sector to urban and industrial jobs, especially in the manufacturing sector. It is estimated that between 1988–1995, the number of factory workers in the country doubled from two to four million, as Thailand's GDP tripled.<ref name=":6">{{cite book|title=Disposable People : New Slavery in the Global Economy|last1=Bales|first1=Kevin|website=ProQuest Ebook Central|publisher=University of California Press}}</ref> While the Asian Financial Crisis that followed in 1997 hit the Thai economy hard, the industrial sector continued to expand under widespread deregulation, as Thailand was mandated to adopt a range of structural adjustment reforms upon receiving funding from the IMF and World Bank. These reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatization and trade liberalization in the country, and decreased federal subsidization of public goods and utilities, agricultural price supports, and regulations on fair wages and labor conditions.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|last=Guille|first=Howard|date=2014|title=Reforming Asian Labor Systems: Economic Tensions and Worker Dissent|url=|journal=Asian Studies Review|volume=39|pages=|via=}}</ref> These changes put further pressure on the agricultural sector, and prompted continued migration from the rural countryside to the growing cities. Many migrant farmers found work in Thailand's growing manufacturing industry, and took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labor regulations and often exploitative conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol4/89-F10110.pdf|title=The Role of Informal Sector in Thailand|last=Warunsiri|first=Sasiwimon|date=2011|website=Research Institute for Policy Evaluation and Design|access-date=}}</ref>

Those that could not find formal factory work, including illegal migrants and the families of rural Thai migrants that followed their relatives to the urban centers, turned to the informal sector to provide the extra support needed for survival—under the widespread regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programs, one family member working in a factory or sweatshop made very little. Scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of Thailand's labor reforms in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state. This can be described as the "externalization of market risk", meaning that as the country's labor market became increasingly deregulated, the burden and responsibility of providing an adequate livelihood shifted from employers and the state to the workers themselves, whose families had to find jobs in the informal sector to make up for the losses and subsidize the wages being made by their relatives in the formal sector. The weight of these economic changes hit migrants and the urban poor especially hard, and the informal sector expanded rapidly as a result.<ref name=":3" />

Today, informal labor in Thailand is typically broken down into three main groups: subcontracted/self employed/home-based workers, service workers (including those that are employed in restaurants, as street vendors, masseuses, taxi drivers, and as domestic workers), and agricultural workers. Not included in these categories are those that work in entertainment, nightlife, and the sex industry. Individuals employed in these facets of the informal labor sector face additional vulnerabilities, including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking.<ref name=":2" />

In general, education levels are low in the informal sector. A 2012 study found that 64% of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school. Many informal workers are also migrants, only some of which have legal status in the country. Education and citizenship are two main barriers to entry for those looking to work in formal industries, and enjoy the labor protections and social security benefits that come along with formal employment. Because the informal labor sector is not recognized under the Labor Protection Act (LPA), informal workers are much more vulnerable labor to exploitation and unsafe working conditions than those employed in more formal and federally recognized industries. While some Thai labor laws provide minimal protections to domestic and agricultural workers, they are often weak and difficult to enforce. Furthermore, Thai social security policies fail to protect against the risks many informal workers face, including workplace accidents and compensation as well as unemployment and retirement insurance. Many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment, and many do not make a living wage.<ref name=":2" /> As a result, labor trafficking is common in the region, affecting children and adults, men and women, and migrants and Thai citizens alike.

Thailand had a population of {{UN_Population|Thailand}}{{UN_Population|ref}} {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}. Thailand's population is largely rural, concentrated in the rice-growing areas of the central, northeastern, and northern regions. About 45.7% of Thailand's population lived in urban areas {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, concentrated mostly in and around the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Area]].

Thailand's government-sponsored family planning program resulted in a dramatic decline in population growth from 3.1% in 1960 to around 0.4% today. In 1970, an average of 5.7 people lived in a Thai household. At the time of the 2010 census, the average Thai household size was 3.2 people.

{{Main|Languages of Thailand}}

[[File:Ethnolinguistic groups of Thailand 1974.png|thumb|170px|left|An ethnolinguistic map of Thailand.]]

The official language of Thailand is [[Thai language|Thai]], a [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai–Kadai language]] closely related to [[Lao language|Lao]], [[Shan language|Shan]] in Myanmar, and numerous smaller languages spoken in an arc from [[Hainan]] and [[Yunnan]] south to the Chinese border. It is the principal language of education and government and spoken throughout the country. The standard is based on the dialect of the central Thai people, and it is written in the [[Thai alphabet]], an [[abugida]] script that evolved from the [[Khmer alphabet]].

Sixty-two languages were recognised by the Royal Thai Government in the 2011 Country Report to the UN Committee responsible for the [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|''International Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination'']], which employed an ethnolinguistic approach and is available from the Department of Rights and Liberties Promotion of the Thai Ministry of Justice.<ref name="CERD/C/THA/1-3" />{{RP|3}} [[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]] is spoken in the southern provinces, and [[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]] is spoken in the provinces that were formerly part of the independent kingdom of [[Lan Na]]. For the purposes of the national census, which does not recognise all 62 languages recognised by the Royal Thai Government in the 2011 Country Report, four dialects of Thai exist; these partly coincide with regional designations.
[[Image:Bangkok National Museum - 2017-04-22 (008).jpg|right|thumb|The Silajaruek of [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] are hundreds of stone inscriptions that form a historical record of the period.]]

The largest of Thailand's minority languages is the [[Lao language|Lao]] dialect of [[Isan language|Isan]] spoken in the northeastern provinces. Although sometimes considered a Thai dialect, it is a Lao dialect, and the region where it is traditionally spoken was historically part of the Lao kingdom of [[Lan Xang]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the far south, [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay]] is the primary language of Malay Muslims. Varieties of Chinese are also spoken by the large [[Thai Chinese]] population, with the [[Teochew dialect]] best-represented.

Numerous tribal languages are also spoken, including many [[Austroasiatic languages]] such as [[Mon language|Mon]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Vietnamese language|Viet]], [[Mlabri language|Mlabri]] and [[Aslian languages|Orang Asli]]; [[Austronesian languages]] such as [[Cham language|Cham]] and [[Moken language|Moken]]; [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] like [[Lawa language|Lawa]], [[Akha language|Akha]], and [[Karen languages|Karen]]; and other [[Tai languages]] such as [[Tai Yo language|Tai Yo]], [[Phu Thai language|Phu Thai]], and [[Saek language|Saek]]. [[Hmong language|Hmong]] is a member of the [[Hmong–Mien languages]], which is now regarded as a language family of its own.

English is a mandatory school subject, but the number of fluent speakers remains low, especially outside cities.

Thailand's prevalent religion is [[Theravada Buddhism]], which is an integral part of Thai identity and culture. Active participation in Buddhism is among the highest in the world. According to the 2000 census, 94.6% and 93.58% in 2010 of the country's population self-identified as Buddhists of the Theravada tradition. [[Islam in Thailand|Muslims]] constitute the second largest religious group in Thailand, comprising 4.29% of the population in 2015.<ref name=CIA /><ref name="US Department of State, Thailand">{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71359.htm |title=US Department of State, Thailand |publisher=State.gov |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412115209/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71359.htm |archivedate=12 April 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Islam is concentrated mostly in the country's southernmost provinces: [[Pattani]], [[Yala Province|Yala]], [[Satun Province|Satun]], [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]], and part of [[Songkhla Province|Songkhla]] [[Chumphon Province|Chumphon]], which are predominantly [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], most of whom are [[Sunni Muslim]]s. Christians represented 1.17% (2015) of the population in 2015, with the remaining population consisting of [[Hinduism in Thailand#Thailand|Hindus]] and [[Sikhism in Thailand|Sikhs]], who live mostly in the country's cities. There is also a small but historically significant [[Jews and Judaism in Thailand|Jewish community in Thailand]] dating back to the 17th century.

Health and medical care is overseen by the [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]] (MOPH), along with several other non-ministerial government agencies, with total national expenditures on health amounting to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2009. [[Non-communicable disease]]s form the major burden of morbidity and mortality, while infectious diseases including malaria and tuberculosis, as well as traffic accidents, are also important public health issues.

The current Minister for Public Health is Prof. Emeritus Piyasakol Sakolsatayadorn, M.D. and the Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Public Health is Jedsada Chokdamrongsuk, M.D. [[Somsak Chunharas]], MD, MPH, was once Deputy Minister for Public Health and is currently a Senior Leadership Fellow at the [[Harvard T.H.

In December 2018 the interim parliament voted to legalize the use of cannabis for medical reasons. Recreational use remained unlawful. The National Legislative Assembly had 166 votes in favor of the amendment to the Narcotics Bill, while there were no nay votes and 13 abstentions. The vote makes Thailand the first Southeast Asian country to allow the use of medical marijuana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/12/25/health/thailand-medical-marijuana-bn/index.html|title=Thailand approves medical marijuana|last=Olam|first=Kocha|last2=Goldschmidt|first2=Debra|date=25 December 2018|website=CNN|access-date=26 December 2018}}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Thailand}}{{See also|Music of Thailand|Isan|Cinema of Thailand}}
Thai culture has been shaped by many influences, including Indian, Lao, Burmese, Cambodian, and Chinese.

Its traditions incorporate a great deal of influence from India, China, Cambodia, and the rest of Southeast Asia. Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism, is central to modern Thai identity. [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]] has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from [[Hinduism]], [[animism]], as well as ancestor worship. The [[Thai solar calendar|official calendar]] in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]] (BE), which is 543 years ahead of the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian (Western) calendar]]. Thus the year 2015 is 2558 BE in Thailand.

Several different ethnic groups, many of which are marginalised, populate Thailand. Some of these groups spill over into Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia and Malaysia and have mediated change between their traditional local culture, national Thai, and global cultural influences. [[Overseas Chinese]] also form a significant part of Thai society, particularly in and around Bangkok. Their successful integration into Thai society has allowed for this group to hold positions of economic and political power. Thai Chinese businesses prosper as part of the larger [[bamboo network]], a network of [[overseas Chinese]] businesses operating in the markets of Southeast Asia that share common family and cultural ties.<ref name="Weidenbaum">{{cite book|author=Murray L Weidenbaum|title=The Bamboo Network: How Expatriate Chinese Entrepreneurs are Creating a New Economic Superpower in Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcRlgZttsMUC|year=1996|publisher=Martin Kessler Books, Free Press|isbn=978-0-684-82289-1|pages=4–8|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905191137/https://books.google.com/books?id=pcRlgZttsMUC|archivedate=5 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Khon Thammasat 20090306 01.jpg|thumb|[[Khon]] show is the most stylised form of Thai performance.]]
The traditional Thai greeting, the ''[[Thai greeting|wai]]'', is generally offered first by the younger of the two people meeting, with their hands pressed together, fingertips pointing upwards as the head is bowed to touch face to fingertips, usually coinciding with the spoken words "sawatdi khrap" for male speakers, and "sawatdi kha" for females. The elder may then respond in the same way. Social status and position, such as in government, will also have an influence on who performs the ''wai'' first. For example, although one may be considerably older than a provincial governor, when meeting it is usually the visitor who pays respect first. When children leave to go to school, they are taught to ''wai'' their parents to indicate their respect. The wai is a sign of respect and reverence for another, similar to the [[namaste]] greeting of India and Nepal.

As with other Asian cultures, respect towards ancestors is an essential part of Thai spiritual practice. Thais have a strong sense of hospitality and generosity, but also a strong sense of social hierarchy. Seniority is paramount in Thai culture. Elders have by tradition ruled in family decisions or ceremonies. Older siblings have duties to younger ones.

Taboos in Thailand include touching someone's head or pointing with the feet, as the head is considered the most sacred and the foot the lowest part of the body.

[[Cuisine of Thailand|Thai cuisine]] blends five fundamental tastes: sweet, spicy, sour, bitter, and salty. Common ingredients used in Thai cuisine include garlic, chillies, lime juice, lemon grass, [[coriander]], [[galangal]], palm sugar, and [[fish sauce]] (''nam pla''). The staple food in Thailand is rice, particularly [[jasmine rice|jasmine variety rice]] (also known as "hom Mali" rice) which forms a part of almost every meal. Thailand was long{{when|date=May 2016}} the world's largest exporter of rice, and Thais domestically consume over 100&nbsp;kg of milled rice per person per year.<ref name=IRRI_Thailand /> Over 5,000 varieties of rice from Thailand are preserved in the rice gene bank of the [[International Rice Research Institute]] (IRRI), based in the Philippines.

=== Media ===
{{Further|Media of Thailand}}
Thai society has been influenced in recent years by its widely available multi-language press and media. There are some English and numerous Thai and Chinese newspapers in circulation. Most Thai popular magazines use English headlines as a [[chic (style)|chic]] glamour factor. Many large businesses in Bangkok operate in English as well as other languages.

Thailand is the largest newspaper market in Southeast Asia with an estimated circulation of over 13 million copies daily in 2003. Even upcountry, out of Bangkok, the media flourish. For example, according to Thailand's Public Relations Department Media Directory 2003–2004, the nineteen provinces of [[Isan]], Thailand's northeastern region, hosted 116 newspapers along with radio, TV, and cable. Since then, another province, Bueng Kan, was incorporated, totalling twenty provinces. In addition, a military coup on 22 May 2014 led to severe state restrictions on all media and forms of expression.

=== Units of measurement ===
{{Further|Thai units of measurement}}
Thailand generally uses the [[metric system]], but [[Thai units of measurement|traditional units of measurement]] for land area are used, and [[imperial units]] of measurement are occasionally used for building materials, such as wood and plumbing fixtures. Years are numbered as B.E. ([[Thai solar calendar|Buddhist Era]]) in educational settings, civil service, government, contracts, and newspaper datelines. However, in banking, and increasingly in industry and commerce, standard Western year (Christian or Common Era) counting is the standard practice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cockatoo.com/english/thailand/thailand-weights-measures.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010141820/http://asiatour.com/thailand-regions-2009/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 October 2017 |title=Weights and measures in Thailand |publisher=Cockatoo.com |date=17 December 1923 |accessdate=25 April 2010 }}</ref>

[[Muay Thai]] ({{lang-th|มวยไทย}}, RTGS: Muai Thai, {{IPA-th|muaj tʰaj|}},<!--mid tones not transcribed--> lit. "Thai boxing") is a native form of kickboxing and Thailand's signature sport. It incorporates kicks, punches, knees and elbow strikes in a ring with gloves similar to those used in Western boxing and this has led to Thailand gaining medals at the Olympic Games in [[boxing]].

[[Association football]] has overtaken muay Thai as the most widely followed sport in contemporary Thai society. [[Thailand national football team]] has played the [[AFC Asian Cup]] six times and reached the semifinals in [[1972 AFC Asian Cup|1972]]. The country has hosted the Asian Cup twice, in 1972 and in [[2007 AFC Asian Cup|2007]]. The 2007 edition was co-hosted together with [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Vietnam]]. It is not uncommon to see Thais cheering their favourite English Premier League teams on television and walking around in replica kit. Another widely enjoyed pastime, and once a competitive sport, is [[kite flying]].

[[Volleyball]] is rapidly growing as one of the most popular sports. The [[Thailand women's national volleyball team|women's team]] has often participated in the [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|World Championship]], [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Cup|World Cup]], and [[FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix|World Grand Prix]] [[Asian Championship]].

[[Takraw]] (Thai: ตะกร้อ) is a sport native to Thailand, in which the players hit a rattan ball and are only allowed to use their feet, knees, chest, and head to touch the ball. [[Sepak takraw]] is a form of this sport which is similar to volleyball. The players must volley a ball over a net and force it to hit the ground on the opponent's side. It is also a popular sport in other countries in Southeast Asia. A rather similar game but played only with the feet is [[buka ball]].

[[Snooker]] has enjoyed increasing popularity in Thailand in recent years, with interest in the game being stimulated by the success of Thai snooker player [[James Wattana]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hodgson |first=Guy |date=18 April 1993 |title=Snooker: A storm coming in from the East: Thailand doesn't boast many world-beating sportsmen.

Other sports in Thailand are slowly growing as the country develops its sporting infrastructure. The success in sports like [[powerlifting|weightlifting]] and [[taekwondo]] at the last two summer Olympic Games has demonstrated that boxing is no longer the only medal option for Thailand.

=== Sporting venues ===
Thammasat Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Bangkok. It is currently used mostly for football matches. The stadium holds 25,000. It is on Thammasat University's Rangsit campus. It was built for the [[1998 Asian Games]] by construction firm Christiani and Nielsen, the same company that constructed the Democracy Monument in Bangkok.

[[Rajamangala National Stadium]] is the biggest sporting arena in Thailand. It currently has a capacity of 65,000. It is in Bang Kapi, Bangkok. The stadium was built in 1998 for the 1998 Asian Games and is the home stadium of the [[Thailand national football team]].

The well-known Lumpini Boxing Stadium will host its final Muay Thai boxing matches on 7 February 2014 after the venue first opened in December 1956. Managed by the Royal Thai Army, the stadium was officially selected for the purpose of muay Thai bouts following a competition that was staged on 15 March 1956. From 11 February 2014, the stadium will relocate to Ram Intra Road, due to the new venue's capacity to accommodate audiences of up to 3,500. Foreigners typically pay between 1,000–2,000 baht to view a match, with prices depending on the location of the seating.<ref>{{cite news|title=End of an era for Muay Thai at Lumpini|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/393517/end-of-an-era-as-lumpini-boxing-stadium-closes-its-doors-on-friday|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=6 February 2014}}</ref>

==National identity==
The Fisheries Department is promoting ''pla gud'', or Siamese fighting fish, as the national fish. Department chief Adisorn Promthep said that the proposal will be submitted to the National Identity Office under the Prime Minister's Office for approval. He said that once the status is recognised, fighting fish farming would be promoted which would generate money and create jobs. He added that credible records show that ''pla gud'' of the ''[[Betta splendens]]'' species are native to Thailand and were first collected for fighting during the reign of King [[Rama III]].<ref>{{cite news |title='Pla gud' to be national fish |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1570858/pla-gud-to-be-national-fish |accessdate=6 November 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=6 November 2018}}</ref>

The capital is [[Khartoum]], located at the confluence of the [[Blue Nile|Blue]] and [[White Nile]]. 

Sudan's history goes back to the [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic period]], witnessing the [[Kerma culture|kingdom of Kerma]] ({{circa}} 2500 BC–1500 BC), the subsequent rule of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|Egyptian New Kingdom]] ({{circa}} 1500 BC–1070 BC) and the rise of the [[kingdom of Kush]] ({{circa}} 785 BC–350 AD), which would in turn [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt|control Egypt]] itself for nearly a century. After the fall of Kush the [[Nubians]] formed the three Christian kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]], with the latter two lasting until around 1500. Between the 14th and 15th centuries much of Sudan was settled by Muslim (But not all Sudanese are considered Arabs). From the 16th–19th centuries, central and eastern Sudan were dominated by the [[Sultanate of Sennar|Funj sultanate]], while [[Sultanate of Darfur|Darfur]] ruled the west and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] the far north. This period saw extensive [[Islamization]].

From 1820 to 1874 the entirety of Sudan  was conquered by the [[Muhammad Ali dynasty]]. Between 1881 and 1885 the harsh Egyptian reign was eventually met with a successful [[Mahdist War|revolt]] led by the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]] [[Muhammad Ahmad]], resulting in the establishment of the [[Mahdist Sudan|Caliphate of Omdurman]]. This state was eventually destroyed in 1898 by the [[British Empire|British]], who would then [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|govern Sudan together with Egypt]].

The 20th century saw the growth of Sudanese nationalism and in 1953 Britain granted Sudan self-government. Independence was proclaimed on January 1, 1956. Since independence, Sudan has been ruled by a series of unstable parliamentary governments and military regimes. Under [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], Sudan instituted [[fundamentalist|Islamic law]] in 1983.<ref name="sudan.gov.sd">{{Cite web |url=http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902160838/http://sudan.gov.sd/ar/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=39&Itemid=75 |archive-date=2 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This exacerbated the rift between the Islamic north, the seat of the government and the animists and Christians in the [[South Sudan|south]].

In 1995, the United Nations (UN) imposed sanctions against Sudan.

==Etymology==
The country's [[Place name origins|place name]] ''Sudan'' is a name given to a [[Sudan (region)|geographical region]] to the south of the [[Sahara]], stretching from Western Africa to eastern Central Africa. The name derives from the Arabic ''{{transl|ar|bilād as-sūdān}}'' ({{lang|ar|بلاد السودان}}), or "the lands of the [[Black people|Blacks]]".<ref>{{citation | author = International Association for the History of Religions | title = Numen | publisher = EJ Brill | place = Leiden | year = 1959 | page = 131 | quote = West Africa may be taken as the country stretching from Senegal in the West, to the Cameroons in the East; sometimes it has been called the central and western Sudan, the ''Bilad as-Sūdan'', 'Land of the Blacks', of the Arabs}}</ref> The name is one of several [[toponym]]s sharing similar [[Placename etymology|etymologies]], ultimately meaning "land of the blacks" or similar meanings, in reference to the dark skin of the inhabitants. Initially, the term "Sudanese" had a negative connotation in Sudan due to its association with black African slaves. The idea of "Sudanese" nationalism goes back to the 1930s and 1940s, when it was popularized by young intellectuals.{{sfn|Sharkey|2007|pp=29–32}}

{{Main|History of Sudan}}

===Prehistoric Sudan (before c. 800 BC)===
[[File: Western Deffufa - Kerma.jpg|thumb|left|The large mud brick temple, known as the shrek or Western Deffufa, in the ancient city of [[Kerma]]]]
[[File: Fortress of the Middle Kingdom, reconstructed under the New Kingdom ( about 1200 B.C.).jpg|thumb|left|Fortress of the Middle Kingdom, reconstructed under the New Kingdom(about 1200 B.C.)]]
By the eighth millennium BC, people of a [[Neolithic]] culture had settled into a sedentary way of life  there in fortified [[mudbrick]] villages, where they supplemented hunting and fishing on the Nile with [[grain]] gathering and [[cattle]] herding.<ref name=locearlyhist>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/sudan |title=Sudan A Country Study |publisher=Countrystudies.us}}</ref> During the fifth millennium BC, migrations from the drying Sahara brought neolithic people into the Nile Valley along with agriculture. The population that resulted from this cultural and genetic mixing developed a social hierarchy over the next centuries which became the Kingdom of Kush (with the capital at Kerma) at 1700 BC. Anthropological and archaeological research indicate that during the predynastic period Nubia and Nagadan Upper Egypt were ethnically, and culturally nearly identical, and thus, simultaneously evolved systems of pharaonic kingship by 3300 BC.<ref name="Keita, S.O.Y. 1993 129–54">{{cite journal|title = Studies and Comments on Ancient Egyptian Biological Relationships| author = Keita, S.O.Y. | year = 1993| journal=History in Africa|volume=20| issue = 7 |pages=129–54|jstor=317196|doi = 10.2307/3171969}}</ref>

===Kingdom of Kush (c. 800 BC–350 AD)===
{{main|Kingdom of Kush|Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt}}
[[File:Sudan Meroe Pyramids 2001.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Nubian pyramids]] in [[Meroë]].]]
[[File:Xerxes detail Ethiopian.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Kušiya'' soldier of the [[Achaemenid army]], circa 480 BCE. [[Xerxes I]] tomb relief.]]

The [[Kingdom of Kush]] was an ancient [[Nubia]]n state centered on the confluences of the [[Blue Nile]] and [[White Nile]], and the [[Atbarah River]] and the [[Nile|Nile River]]. It was established after the [[Bronze Age]] collapse and the disintegration of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]], centered at Napata in its early phase.

After King Kashta ("the Kushite") invaded Egypt in the eighth century BC, the Kushite kings ruled as pharaohs of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]] for a century before being defeated and driven out by the [[Assyria]]ns. At the height of their glory, the Kushites conquered an empire that stretched from what is now known as [[South Kordofan]] all the way to the Sinai. Pharaoh [[Piye]] attempted to expand the empire into the Near East, but was thwarted by the Assyrian king [[Sargon II]]. 

The Kingdom of Kush is mentioned in the Bible as having saved the Israelites from the wrath of the Assyrians, although disease among the besiegers was the main reason for the failure to take the city.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roux, Georges |title=Ancient Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=klZX8B_RzzYC|date= 1992|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193825-7}}</ref>{{page needed|date=June 2013}}
The war that took place between Pharaoh [[Taharqa]] and the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] was a decisive event in western history, with the Nubians being defeated in their attempts to gain a foothold in the [[Near East]] by Assyria. Sennacherib's successor [[Esarhaddon]] went further, and invaded Egypt itself, deposing Taharqa and driving the Nubians from Egypt entirely. Taharqa fled back to his homeland where he died two years later. Egypt became an Assyrian colony; however, king [[Tantamani]], after succeeding Taharqa, made a final determined attempt to regain Egypt. Esarhaddon died while preparing to leave the Assyrian capital of [[Nineveh]] in order to eject him. However, his successor [[Ashurbanipal]] (668 – c. 627 BC) sent a large army into southern Egypt and routed Tantamani, ending all hopes of a revival of the Nubian Empire.

During Classical Antiquity, the Nubian capital was at [[Meroë]]. In [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Ethiopia]] (a term also used earlier by the Assyrians when encountering the Nubians). The civilization of Kush was among the first in the world to use iron smelting technology. The Nubian kingdom at Meroë persisted until the mid fourth century AD.

===Medieval Nubian kingdoms (c. 350–1500)===
{{main|Nobatia|Makuria|Alodia|Daju kingdom}} 
[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The three Christian Nubian kingdoms. The northern border of [[Alodia]] is unclear, but it also might have been located further north, between the fourth and fifth [[Cataracts of the Nile|Nile cataract]].{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=26}}]]
On the turn of the fifth century the [[Blemmyes]] established a short-lived state in Upper Egypt and Lower Nubia, probably centered around Talmis ([[Kalabsha]]), but before 450 they were already driven out of the Nile Valley by the Nobatians. The latter eventually founded a kingdom on their own, [[Nobatia]].{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=16–22}}
By the 6th century there were in total three Nubian kingdoms: Nobatia in the north, which had its capital at Pachoras ([[Faras]]); the central kingdom, [[Makuria]] centred at Tungul ([[Old Dongola]]), about {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=off|0}} south of modern [[Dongola]]; and [[Alodia]], in the heartland of the old Kushitic kingdom, which had its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]] (now a suburb of modern-day Khartoum).{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=24, 26}} Still in the sixth century they converted to Christianity.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=16–17}} In the seventh century, probably at some point between 628 and 642, Nobatia was incorporated into Makuria.{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=77}}

Between 639 and 641 the Muslim Arabs of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|conquered]] [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Egypt. In [[First Battle of Dongola|641 or 642]] and again in [[Second Battle of Dongola|652]] they invaded Nubia but were repelled, making the Nubians one of the few who managed to defeat the Arabs during the [[Islamic expansion]]. Afterwards the Makurian king and the Arabs agreed on a [[Baqt|unique non-aggression pact that also included an annual exchange of gifts]], thus acknowledging Makuria's independence.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=68–70}} While the Arabs failed to conquer Nubia they began to settle east of the Nile, where they eventually founded several port towns{{sfn|Hasan|1967|p=31}} and intermarried with the local [[Beja people|Beja]].{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=77–78}}
[[File:King Moses George of Makuria.jpg|left|thumb|[[Moses George of Makuria|Moses George]], king of Makuria and Alodia]]
From the mid 8th-mid 11th century the political power and cultural development of Christian Nubia peaked.{{sfn|Shinnie|1978|p=572}} In 747 Makuria invaded Egypt, which at this time belonged to the declining [[Umayyads]],{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=84}} and it did so again in the early 960s, when it pushed as far north as [[Akhmim]].{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=101}} Makuria maintained close dynastic ties with Alodia, perhaps resulting in the temporary unification of the two kingdoms into one state.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=89}} The culture of the medieval Nubians has been described as "''Afro-Byzantine''",{{sfn|Ruffini|2012|p=264}} but was also increasingly influenced by Arab culture.{{sfn|Martens-Czarnecka|2015|pp=249–265}} The state organization was extremely centralized,{{sfn|Werner|2013|p=254}} being based on the [[Byzantine bureaucracy]] of the 6th and 7th centuries.{{sfn|Edwards|2004|p=237}} Arts flourished in the form of pottery paintings{{sfn|Adams|1977|p=496}} and especially wall paintings.{{sfn|Adams|1977|p=482}} The Nubians developed an own alphabet for their language, [[Old Nubian|Old Nobiin]], basing it on the [[Coptic alphabet]], while also utilizing [[Medieval Greek|Greek]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Arabic]].{{sfn|Welsby|2002|pp=236–239}} Women enjoyed high social status: they had access to education, could own, buy and sell land and often used their wealth to endow churches and church paintings.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=344–345}} Even the royal succession was [[matrilineal]], with the son of the king's sister being the rightful heir.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=88}}

From the late 11th/12th century, Makuria's capital Dongola was in decline, and Alodia's capital declined in the 12th century as well.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=252}} In the 14th and 15th centuries [[Bedouin]] tribes overran most of Sudan,{{sfn|Hasan|1967|p=176}} migrating to the [[Butana]], the [[Gezira (state)|Gezira]], [[Kordofan]] and [[Darfur]].{{sfn|Hasan|1967|p=145}} In 1365 a civil war forced the Makurian court to flee to [[Gebel Adda]] in [[Lower Nubia]], while Dongola was destroyed and left to the Arabs. Afterwards Makuria continued to exist only as a petty kingdom.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=143–145}} After the prosperous{{sfn|Lajtar|2011|pp=130–131}} reign of king [[Joel of Dotawo|Joel]] ({{flourished}} 1463–1484) Makuria probably collapsed.{{sfn|Ruffini|2012|p=256}} 
To the south, the kingdom of Alodia fell to either the Arabs, commanded by tribal leader [[Abdallah Jamma]], or the [[Funj]], an African people originating from the south.{{sfn|Welsby|2002|p=255}} Datings range from the [[Hijri year|9th century after the Hijra]] ({{circa}} 1396–1494),{{sfn|Vantini|1975|pp=786–787}} the late 15th century,{{sfn|Hasan|1967|p=133}} 1504{{sfn|Vantini|1975|p=784}} to 1509.{{sfn|Vantini|2006|pp=487–489}} An alodian rump state might have survived in the form of the [[kingdom of Fazughli]], lasting until 1685.{{sfn|Spaulding|1974|pp=12–30}}

===Islamic kingdoms of Sennar and Darfur (c. 1500–1821)===

[[File:Sennar mosque (cropped).jpg|thumb|270px|The great mosque of [[Sennar]], built in the 17th century.{{sfn|Holt|Daly|2000|p=25}}]]
In 1504 the Funj are recorded to have founded the [[Kingdom of Sennar]], in which Abdallah Jamma's realm was incorporated.{{sfn|O'Fahey|Spaulding|1974|pp=25–26}} By 1523, when Jewish traveller [[David Reubeni]] visited Sudan, the Funj state already extended as far north as Dongola.{{sfn|O'Fahey|Spaulding|1974|p=26}} Meanwhile, Islam began to be preached on the Nile by [[Sufism|Sufi]] holymen who settled there in the 15th and 16th centuries{{sfn|Loimeier|2013|p=150}} and by David Reubeni's visit king [[Amara Dunqas]], previously a Pagan or nominal Christian, was recorded to be Muslim.{{sfn|O'Fahey|Spaulding|1974|p=31}} However, the Funj would retain un-Islamic customs like the divine kingship or the consummation of alcohol until the 18th century.{{sfn|Loimeier|2013|pp=151–152}} Sudanese [[Folk religion|folk Islam]] preserved many rituals stemming from Christian traditions until the recent past.{{sfn|Werner|2013|pp=177–184}}

Soon the Funj came in conflict with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], who had occupied [[Suakin]] around 1526{{sfn|Peacock|2012|p=98}} and eventually pushed south along the Nile, reaching the third Nile cataract area in 1583/1584. A subsequent Ottoman attempt to capture Dongola was [[battle of Hannik|repelled]] by the Funj in 1585.{{sfn|Peacock|2012|pp=96–97}} Afterwards, [[Hannik]], located just south of the third cataract, would mark the border between the two states.{{sfn|O'Fahey|Spaulding|1974|p=35}} The aftermath of the Ottoman invasion saw the attempted usurpation of [[Ajib the Great|Ajib]], a minor king of northern Nubia.<!--He is said to have conquered eastern Sudan http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:586255/FULLTEXT01.pdf p. 17 Paul 77,81-83<!--In around 1580 he conquered eastern Sudan and northwestern Eritrea, --> While the Funj eventually killed him in 1611/1612 his successors, the [[Abdallab]], were granted to govern everything north of the confluence of Blue and White Niles with considerable autonomy.{{sfn|O'Fahey|Spaulding|1974|pp=36–40}}

<!--Afterwards the Funj state expanded  To compensate this loss and to meet the growing danger posed by the [[Dinka]] and [[Shilluk]] (the latter had founded a [[Shilluk Kingdom|kingdom]] on their own by the early 17th century),

===Turkiyah and Mahdist Sudan (1821–1899)===
{{Main|History of Sudan (1821–1885)|Mahdist Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian conquest of Sudan}}
[[File:Ismail Pacha.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|Ismail Pasha, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Khedive]] of Egypt and Sudan from 1863 to 1879.]]
[[File:Muhammad Ahmad al-Mahdi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Muhammad Ahmad]] ruler of Sudan, 1881–1885.]]
In 1821, the Ottoman ruler of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]], had invaded and conquered northern Sudan. Although technically the [[Vali (governor)|Vali]] of Egypt under the [[Ottoman Empire]], Muhammad Ali styled himself as [[Khedive]] of a virtually independent Egypt. Seeking to add Sudan to his domains, he sent his third son Ismail (not to be confused with [[Isma'il Pasha]] mentioned later) to conquer the country, and subsequently incorporate it into Egypt. Except of the Shaiqiya and the Darfur sultanate in Kordofan he was met without resistance. The Egyptian policy of conquest was expanded and intensified by [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]]'s son, Isma'il, under whose reign most of the remainder of modern-day Sudan was conquered.

The Egyptian authorities made significant improvements to the Sudanese infrastructure (mainly in the north), especially with regard to irrigation and cotton production. In 1879, the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|Great Powers]] forced the removal of Ismail and established his son [[Tewfik Pasha]] in his place. Tewfik's corruption and mismanagement resulted in the [['Urabi revolt]], which threatened the Khedive's survival. Tewfik appealed for help to the British, who subsequently occupied Egypt in 1882. Sudan was left in the hands of the Khedivial government, and the mismanagement and corruption of its officials.<ref>{{cite book|last=Churchill|first=Winston|title=The River War|year=1902|chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/riverwarhistoric00chur|chapter=The Rebellion of the Mahdi}}</ref><ref name="SlatinWingate1896">{{cite book|author1=Rudolf Carl Freiherr von Slatin|author2=Sir Francis Reginald Wingate|title=Fire and Sword in the Sudan|url=https://archive.org/details/riverwarhistoric00chur|accessdate=26 June 2013|year=1896|publisher=E. Arnold}}</ref>

During the Khedivial period, dissent had spread due to harsh taxes imposed on most activities. Taxation on irrigation wells and farming lands were so high most farmers abandoned their farms and livestock. During the 1870s, European initiatives against the [[slave trade]] had an adverse impact on the economy of northern Sudan, precipitating the rise of [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist]] forces.<ref>{{cite web|author=Domke, D.

The Mahdiyah (Mahdist regime) imposed traditional Sharia [[Sharia|Islamic law]]s.

From his announcement of the Mahdiyya in June 1881 until the [[Siege of Khartoum|fall of Khartoum]] in January 1885, Muhammad Ahmad led a [[Mahdist War|successful military campaign]] against the Turco-Egyptian government of the Sudan, known as the [[Turkiyah]]. Muhammad Ahmad died on 22 June 1885, a mere six months after the conquest of Khartoum. After a power struggle amongst his deputies, [[Abdallahi ibn Muhammad]], with the help primarily of the [[Baggara]] of western Sudan, overcame the opposition of the others and emerged as unchallenged leader of the Mahdiyah. After consolidating his power, Abdallahi ibn Muhammad assumed the title of ''Khalifa'' (successor) of the Mahdi, instituted an administration, and appointed [[Ansar (Sudan)|Ansar]] (who were usually Baqqara) as emirs over each of the several provinces.
[[File:Battle of Omdurman-1.JPG|thumb|250px|The flight of the Khalifa after his defeat at the [[Battle of Omdurman]].]]
Regional relations remained tense throughout much of the Mahdiyah period, largely because of the Khalifa's brutal methods to extend his rule throughout the country. In 1887, a 60,000-man Ansar army invaded [[Ethiopia]], penetrating as far as [[Gondar]]. In March 1889, king [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia marched on [[Metemma]]; however, after Yohannes fell in battle, the Ethiopian forces withdrew. Abd ar Rahman an Nujumi, the Khalifa's general, attempted an invasion of Egypt in 1889, but British-led Egyptian troops defeated the Ansar at Tushkah. The failure of the Egyptian invasion broke the spell of the Ansar's invincibility. The [[Belgium|Belgians]] prevented the Mahdi's men from conquering [[Equatoria]], and in 1893, the Italians repelled an Ansar attack at [[Agordat]] (in [[Eritrea]]) and forced the Ansar to withdraw from Ethiopia.

In the 1890s, the British sought to re-establish their control over Sudan, once more officially in the name of the Egyptian Khedive, but in actuality treating the country as a British colony. By the early 1890s, British, French and Belgian claims had converged at the [[Nile]] headwaters. Britain feared that the other powers would take advantage of Sudan's instability to acquire territory previously annexed to Egypt. Apart from these political considerations, Britain wanted to establish control over the Nile to safeguard a planned irrigation dam at [[Aswan]].  [[Herbert Kitchener]] led military campaigns against the [[Mahdist Sudan]] from 1896 to 1898. Kitchener's campaigns culminated in a decisive victory in the [[Battle of Omdurman]] on 2 September 1898.

===Anglo-Egyptian Sudan (1899–1956)===
{{Main|Anglo-Egyptian Sudan}}
[[File:The war in the Soudan.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The [[Mahdist War]] was fought between a group of Muslim dervishes, called [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdists]], who had over-run much of Sudan, and the British forces.]]

In 1899, Britain and Egypt reached an agreement under which Sudan was run by a governor-general appointed by Egypt with British consent. In reality, Sudan was effectively administered as a [[Crown colony]].  The British were keen to reverse the process, started under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], of uniting the [[Nile Valley]] under Egyptian leadership and sought to frustrate all efforts aimed at further uniting the two countries.

Under the Delimitation, Sudan's border with Abyssinia was contested by raiding tribesmen trading slaves, breaching boundaries of the law.  In 1905 Local chieftain [[Sultan Yambio]] reluctant to the end gave up the struggle with British forces that had occupied the [[Kordofan]] region, finally ending the lawlessness.  The continued British administration of Sudan fuelled an increasingly strident nationalist backlash, with Egyptian nationalist leaders determined to force Britain to recognise a single independent union of Egypt and Sudan.  With a formal end to Ottoman rule in 1914, Sir Reginald Wingate was sent that December to occupy Sudan as the new Military Governor.  [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] was declared [[Sultan of Egypt and Sudan]], as was his brother and successor, [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]].  They continued upon their insistence of a single Egyptian-Sudanese state even when the [[Sultanate of Egypt]] was retitled as the [[Kingdom of Egypt|Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan]], but it was [[Saad Zaghloul]] who continued to be frustrated in the ambitions until his death in 1927.<ref>M. Daly, ''Empire on the Nile'', p.346.</ref> 
[[File:Anglo-Egyptian Sudan camel soldier of the British army.jpg|thumb|right|A camel soldier of the native forces of the British army, early 20th century.]]

From 1924 until independence in 1956, the British had a policy of running Sudan as two essentially separate territories, the north and south.  The assassination of a Governor-General of Khartoum in Cairo was the causative factor; it brought demands of the newly elected Wafd government from colonial forces.  A permanent establishment of two battalions in Khartoum was renamed the [[Sudan Defence Force]] acting as under the government, replacing the former garrison of Egyptian army soldiers, saw action afterwards during the [[Wal Wal Incident]].<ref>Morewood, ''The British Defence of Egypt'', (Suffolk 2005), p.4</ref> The [[Wafdist]] parliamentary majority had rejected Sarwat Pasha's accommodation plan with Austen Chamberlain in London; yet Cairo still needed the money.  The Sudan Government's revenue had reached a peak in 1928 at £6.6 million, thereafter the Wafdist disruptions, and Italian borders incursions from Somaliland, London decided to reduce expenditure during the Great Depression.  Cotton and Gum exports were dwarfed by the necessity to import almost everything from Britain leading to a balance of payments deficit at Khartoum.<ref>Daly, pp.457–59</ref>

In July 1936 the Liberal Constitutional leader, Muhammed Mahmoud was persuaded to bring Wafd delegates to London to sign the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, "the beginning of a new stage in Anglo-Egyptian relations", wrote [[Anthony Eden]].<ref>Morewood, 
''The British Defence of Egypt 1935–40'', (Suffolk, 1940), p.94-5</ref> The British Army was allowed to return to the Sudan to protect the Canal Zone.  They were able to find training facilities; and the RAF was free to fly over Egyptian territory.  It did not, however, resolve the problem of Sudan: the Sudanese Intelligentsia agitated for a return to metropolitan rule, conspiring with Germany's agents.<ref>[[Arthur Henderson]], 8 May 1936 quoted in Daly, ''Empire on the Nile'', p.348</ref>

Mussolini made it clear that he could not invade Abyssinia without first conquering Egypt and Sudan; they intended unification of Libya with Italian East Africa.  The British Imperial General Staff prepared for a military defence of the region, which was lamentably thin on the ground.<ref>Sir Miles Lampson quoted in a diary, 29 September 1938; Morewood, p.117</ref> The British ambassador blocked Italian attempts to secure a Non-Aggression Treaty with Egypt-Sudan.  But Mahmoud was a supporter of the Mufti of Jerusalem; the region was caught between the Empire's efforts to save the Jews, and moderate Arab calls to halt migration.<ref>Morewood, p.164-5</ref>

The Sudanese Government was directly involved militarily in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]].  Formed in 1925, the [[Sudan Defence Force]] played an active part in responding to incursions early in World War Two.  Italian troops occupied [[Kassala]] and other border areas from [[Italian East Africa|Italian Somaliland]] during 1940.  In 1942, the SDF also played a part in the invasion of the Italian colony by British and Commonwealth forces.  The last British [[governor-general]] was [[Robert George Howe]].

The [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] finally heralded the beginning of the march towards Sudanese independence.  Having abolished the monarchy in 1953, Egypt's new leaders, [[Mohammed Naguib]], whose mother was Sudanese, and later [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], believed the only way to end British domination in Sudan was for Egypt to officially abandon its claims of sovereignty.  In addition Nasser knew it would be difficult for Egypt to govern an impoverished Sudan after its independence.  The British on the other hand continued their political and financial support for the Mahdist successor, [[Abd al-Rahman al-Mahdi]], whom it was believed would resist Egyptian pressure for Sudanese independence.  Rahman was capable of this, but his regime was plagued by political ineptitude, which garnered a colossal loss of support in northern and central Sudan.  Both Egypt and Britain sensed a great instability fomenting, and thus opted to allow both Sudanese regions, north and south to have a free vote on whether they wished independence or a British withdrawal.

Dissatisfaction culminated in a second [[1969 Sudanese coup d'état|coup d'état]] on 25 May 1969. The coup leader, Col. [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], became prime minister, and the new regime abolished parliament and outlawed all political parties.  Disputes between [[Marxist]] and non-Marxist elements within the ruling military coalition resulted in [[1971 Sudanese coup d'état|a briefly successful coup in July 1971]], led by the [[Sudanese Communist Party]]. Several days later, anti-communist military elements restored Nimeiry to power.
In 1972, the [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|Addis Ababa Agreement]] led to a cessation of the north-south civil war and a degree of self-rule.  This led to ten years hiatus in the civil war but less happily an end to American investment in the [[Jonglei Canal]] project.  This had been considered absolutely essential to irrigate the Upper Nile region and to prevent an environmental catastrophe and wide-scale famine among the local tribes, most especially the Dinka.  In the civil war that followed their homeland was raided looted, pillaged and burned.  Many of the tribe were murdered in a bloody civil war that raged for over 20 years.

[[File:Hashem al Atta, 1971 Sudanese coup d'état.jpg|thumb|[[1971 Sudanese coup d'état]]]]
Until the early 1970s, Sudan's agricultural output was mostly dedicated to internal consumption. In 1972, the Sudanese government became more pro-Western, and made plans to export food and [[cash crop]]s. However, commodity prices declined throughout the 1970s causing economic problems for Sudan. At the same time, debt servicing costs, from the money spent mechanizing agriculture, rose. In 1978, the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] negotiated a [[Structural Adjustment Program]] with the government. This further promoted the mechanized export agriculture sector. This caused great hardship for the pastoralists of Sudan (see [[Nuba peoples#Effect of private agriculture schemes|Nuba peoples]]).  In 1976, the Ansars had mounted a bloody but unsuccessful coup attempt. But in July 1977, President Nimeiry met with Ansar leader [[Sadiq al-Mahdi]], opening the way for a possible reconciliation.  Hundreds of political prisoners were released, and in August a general amnesty was announced for all oppositionists.

====Partition and rehabilitation====
The [[Sudanese conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile]] in the early 2010s between [[Sudan People's Armed Forces|the Army of Sudan]] and the [[Sudan Revolutionary Front]] started as a dispute over the oil-rich region of [[Abyei]] in the months leading up to [[South Sudan|South Sudanese independence]] in 2011, though it is also related to civil war in Darfur that is nominally resolved. The events would later be known as the [[Protests in Sudan (2011–13)|Sudanese Intifada]], which would end only in 2013 after al-Bashir promised he would not seek re-election in 2015. He later broke his promise and sought re-election in 2015, winning through a boycott from the opposition who believed that the elections would not be free and fair. Voter turnout was at a low 46%.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-32481013</ref> 

On January 13, 2017, the president of the US, [[Barack Obama]], signed an Executive Order that lifted many sanctions placed against Sudan and assets of its government held abroad.  On October 6, 2017, the following president of the US, [[Donald Trump]], lifted most of the remaining sanctions against the country and its petroleum, export-import, and property industries.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wadhams|first1=Nick|last2=Gebre|first2=Samuel|title=Trump Moves to Lift Most Sudan Sanctions|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-06/u-s-lifting-most-sudan-sanctions-on-progress-in-terrorism-fight|accessdate=6 October 2017|work=Bloomberg Politics|date=6 October 2017}}</ref>

On December 19, 2018, [[Sudanese protests (2018–19)|massive protests]] began after a government decision to triple the price of goods at a time when the country is suffering an acute shortage of foreign currency and inflation of 70 percent. In addition, President al-Bashir, who has been in power for more than 30 years, refused to step down, resulting in the convergence of opposition groups to form a united coalition. The government retaliated by arresting more than 800 opposition figures and protesters, leading to the death of approximately 40 people according to the Human Rights Watch although the number is much higher than that according to local and civilian reports. The protests have continued up to the present time.<ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/sudan-crowds-rally-bashir-police-tear-gas-rival-protest-190109115845545.html</ref><ref>https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/future-unclear-sudan-protesters-president-loggerheads-190108135021310.html</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Sudan}}

[[File:Map of Sudan (New).jpg|thumb|upright=2.05|A map of Sudan. The [[Hala'ib Triangle]] has been under Egyptian administration since 2000.]]
[[File:Sudan map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|A [[Köppen climate classification]] map of Sudan.]]
Sudan is situated in northern Africa, with a {{convert|853|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} coastline bordering the [[Red Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iss.co.za/AF/profiles/Sudan/Geog.html |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513112555/http://www.iss.co.za/AF/profiles/Sudan/Geog.html |archivedate=13 May 2011 |title=Sudan geography |publisher= Institute for Security Studies |date=12 January 2005}}</ref> It has land borders with [[Egypt]], [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[South Sudan]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], and [[Libya]]. With an area of {{convert|1886068|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, it is the third-largest country on the continent (after [[Algeria]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) and the sixteenth-largest in the world.

Sudan lies between latitudes [[8th parallel north|8°]] and [[23rd parallel north|23°N]]. The terrain is generally flat plains, broken by several mountain ranges. In the west the [[Deriba Caldera]] ({{convert|3042|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), located in the [[Marrah Mountains]], is the highest point in Sudan. In the east are the [[Red Sea Hills]].<ref>{{cite web |date=n.d. |url= http://www.country-studies.com/sudan/geography.html |title=Sudan |publisher=Country Studies |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

The [[Blue Nile|Blue]] and [[White Nile]] rivers meet in [[Khartoum]] to form the [[Nile]], which flows northwards through Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. The Blue Nile's course through Sudan is nearly {{convert|800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} long and is joined by the [[Dinder River|Dinder]] and [[Rahad River]]s between [[Sennar]] and [[Khartoum]]. The White Nile within Sudan has no significant tributaries.

There are several dams on the Blue and White Niles. Among them are the [[Sennar Dam|Sennar]] and [[Roseires Dam]]s on the Blue Nile, and the [[Jebel Aulia Dam]] on the White Nile. There is also [[Lake Nubia]] on the Sudanese-Egyptian border.

Rich mineral resources are available in Sudan including [[asbestos]], [[chromite]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[granite]], [[gypsum]], [[iron]], [[kaolin]], [[lead]], [[manganese]], [[mica]], [[natural gas]], [[nickel]], [[petroleum]], [[silver]], [[tin]], [[uranium]] and [[zinc]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.sudan-embassy.co.uk/infobook/geograph.php |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050930235450/http://www.sudan-embassy.co.uk/infobook/geograph.php |archivedate=30 September 2005 |title=Geography of Sudan |publisher=Sudan Embassy in London |date=n.d.}}</ref>

===Climate===
The amount of rainfall increases towards the south. The central and the northern part have extremely dry desert areas such as the [[Nubian Desert]] to the northeast and the [[Bayuda Desert]] to the east; in the south there are swamps and rainforest. Sudan's rainy season lasts for about three months (July to September) in the north, and up to six months (June to November) in the south.

The dry regions are plagued by [[Dust storm|sandstorms]], known as [[haboob]], which can completely block out the sun. In the northern and western semi-desert areas, people rely on the scant rainfall for basic agriculture and many are [[nomad]]ic, travelling with their herds of [[sheep]] and [[camel]]s. Nearer the River Nile, there are [[irrigation|well-irrigated]] farms growing [[cash crops]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/kidsweb/world/sudan/sudgeog.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121001164348/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/coolplanet/kidsweb/world/sudan/sudgeog.htm |archivedate= 1 October 2012 |title=Sudan – Geography & Environment |publisher=[[Oxfam GB]] |date=n.d. |accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref> The sunshine duration is very high all over the country but especially in deserts where it could soar to over 4,000 h per year.

===Environmental issues===
[[Desertification]] is a serious problem in Sudan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://iddcs.uofk.edu/index.php?direction=ltr&lang=en |title=Desertification & Desert Cultivation Studies Institute |publisher=University of Khartoum |date= n.d. |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> There is also concern over [[soil erosion]]. Agricultural expansion, both public and private, has proceeded without [[Conservation movement|conservation]] measures. The consequences have manifested themselves in the form of [[deforestation]], soil desiccation, and the lowering of [[soil fertility]] and the [[water table]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80044e/80044E06.htm |title=Soil conservation and land reclamation in the Sudan |publisher=United Nations University  |date=n.d. |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

The nation's wildlife is threatened by poaching. As of 2001, twenty-one mammal species and nine bird species are endangered, as well as two species of plants. Critically endangered species include: the [[northern bald ibis|waldrapp]], [[northern white rhinoceros]], [[tora hartebeest]], [[rhim gazelle|slender-horned gazelle]], and [[hawksbill turtle]]. The [[Scimitar oryx|Sahara oryx]] has become extinct in the wild.<ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=January 2011|reason=appear to be user-generated site; how are entries vetted?}} {{cite web |url= http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Sudan-ENVIRONMENT.html |title=Sudan – Environment |work=Encyclopedia of the Nations |date=n.d. |accessdate=13 January 2011}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Sudan}}

Officially, the [[politics of Sudan]] takes place in the framework of a [[Federal republic|federal]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]], where the [[List of heads of state of Sudan|President of Sudan]] is [[head of state]], [[head of government]] and [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[Sudan People's Armed Forces]] in a [[multi-party system]]. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[parliament]]—the [[National Legislature of Sudan|National Legislature]], with its [[National Assembly of Sudan|National Assembly]] (lower chamber) and the [[Council of States of Sudan|Council of States]] (upper chamber). The [[judiciary]] is independent and obtained by the [[Constitutional Court]].<ref name=cia/> It is part of the Northern Africa grouping of the [[United Nations geoscheme|UN geoscheme]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm |title=Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings |publisher=United Nations Statistics Division |date=11 February 2013|accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Darfur JEM.png|thumb|[[Justice and Equality Movement|JEM]] rebels in Darfur. Both the government and the rebels have been accused of atrocities.]]
Executive posts are divided between the NCP, the SPLA, the [[Eastern Front (Sudan)|Sudanese Eastern Front]] and factions of the [[Umma Party (Sudan)|Umma Party]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party (Sudan)|Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP).

According to the new 2005 constitution, the bicameral National Legislature is the official Sudanese parliament and is divided between two chambers—the National Assembly, a lower house with 450 seats, and the Council of States, an upper house with 50 seats. Thus the parliament consists of 500 appointed members altogether, where all are indirectly elected by state legislatures to serve six-year terms.<ref name=cia/>

===Sharia law===
The legal system in Sudan is based on Islamic [[Sharia law]]. The 2005 [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement|Naivasha Agreement]], ending the civil war between north and south Sudan, established some protections for non-Muslims in Khartoum. Sudan's application of Sharia law is geographically inconsistent.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/sudan-sharia-legal-system|title=Sudan's haphazard Sharia legal system has claimed too many victims|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2012-06-06|last1=Malik|first1=Nesrine}}</ref>

[[Crucifixion]] is a legal punishment.

The judicial branch of the Sudanese government consists of a Constitutional Court of nine justices, the National Supreme Court, the Court of Cassation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/sudanese-woman-sentenced-death-christian-freed-court-article-1.1840177|title=Court frees Sudanese woman sentenced to death for being Christian|author=Michael Sheridan|date=23 June 2014|work=nydailynews.com}}</ref><!--and National Courts of Appeal,--> and other national courts; the National Judicial Service Commission provides overall management for the judiciary.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Sudan}}
[[File:Al bashir1.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|Bashir (right) and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State [[Robert Zoellick]], 2005]]
Sudan has had a troubled relationship with many of its neighbours and much of the international community, owing to what is viewed as its radical Islamic stance. For much of the 1990s, [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] formed an ad-hoc alliance called the "Front Line States" with support from the United States to check the influence of the [[National Islamic Front]] government. The Sudanese Government supported anti-Ugandan rebel groups such as the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA).<ref>"[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20055835-503543/the-worlds-enduring-dictators/ The world's enduring dictators]". CBS News. 16 May 2011.</ref>

As the National Islamic Front regime in Khartoum gradually emerged as a real threat to the region and the world, the U.S. began to list Sudan on its list of [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]]. After the US listed Sudan as a state sponsor of terrorism, the [[National Islamic Front|NIF]] decided to develop relations with [[Iraq]], and later [[Iran]], the two most controversial countries in the region.

From the mid-1990s, Sudan gradually began to moderate its positions as a result of increased U.S. pressure following the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|1998 U.S. embassy bombings]], in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]], and the new development of oil fields previously in rebel hands. Sudan also has a territorial dispute with Egypt over the [[Hala'ib Triangle]]. Since 2003, the foreign relations of Sudan had centered on the support for ending the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]] and condemnation of government support for militias in the [[war in Darfur]].

Sudan has extensive economic relations with China. China obtains ten percent of its oil from Sudan. According to a former Sudanese government minister, China is Sudan's largest supplier of arms.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21143-2004Dec22.html |title=China Invests Heavily In Sudan's Oil Industry – Beijing Supplies Arms Used on Villagers |newspaper=The Washington Post |author=Goodman, Peter S. |date=23 December 2004 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref>

In December 2005, Sudan became one of the few states to recognize Moroccan sovereignty over [[Western Sahara]].<ref>{{cite news |archivedate=26 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226210429/http://www.moroccotimes.com/paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=11765 |url=http://www.moroccotimes.com/paper/article.asp?idr=2&id=11765 |title=Sudan supports Moroccan sovereignty over Southern Provinces |newspaper=Morocco Times |location=Casablanca |date=26 December 2005}}</ref>

===Armed Forces===
{{Main|Sudan People's Armed Forces}}
The Sudan People's Armed Forces is the regular forces of Sudan and is divided into five branches: the Sudanese Army, Sudanese Navy (including the Marine Corps), [[Sudanese Air Force]], Border Patrol and the Internal Affairs Defense Force, totalling about 200,000 troops. The military of Sudan has become a well-equipped fighting force, thanks to increasing local production of heavy and advanced arms.

Since the [[War in Darfur|Darfur crisis]] in 2004, safe-keeping the central government from the armed resistance and rebellion of paramilitary rebel groups such as the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement|Sudan People's Liberation Army]] (SPLA), the [[Sudan Liberation Army|Sudanese Liberation Army]] (SLA) and the [[Justice and Equality Movement]] (JEM) have been important priorities.

===International organizations in Sudan===
Several UN agents are operating in Sudan such as the [[World Food Program]] (WFP); the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations (FAO); the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP); the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organizations]] (UNIDO); the United Nations Children Fund ([[UNICEF]]); the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR); the United Nations Mine Service ([[UNMAS]]), the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the [[World Bank]].

Since Sudan has experienced civil war for many years, many non-governmental organisations (NGOs) are also involved in humanitarian efforts to help internally displaced people. The NGOs are working in every corner of Sudan, especially in the southern part and western parts. During the civil war, international nongovernmental organizations such as the Red Cross were operating mostly in the south but based in the capital Khartoum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/sudan_darfuroverview.html |title= Darfur – overview |publisher=Unicef |date=n.d. |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> The attention of NGOs shifted shortly after the war broke out in the western part of Sudan known as Darfur.

Even though most of the international organizations are substantially concentrated in both South Sudan and [[Darfur]] region, some of them are working in the northern part as well. For example, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] is successfully operating in [[Khartoum]], the capital. It is mainly funded by the European Union and recently opened more vocational training. The Canadian International Development Agency is operating largely in northern Sudan.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.unido.org/media-centre/press-releases/news/article/date////eu-unido-set-up-centre-in-sudan-to-develop-industrial-skills-entrepreneurship-for-job-creation.html |title=EU, UNIDO set up Centre in Sudan to develop industrial skills, entrepreneurship for job creation |publisher=UN Industrial Development Organization |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=4 June 2013}}</ref>

===Regional bodies and areas of conflict===
In addition to the states, there also exist regional administrative bodies established by peace agreements between the central government and rebel groups.

*The [[Darfur Regional Authority]] was established by the [[Darfur Peace Agreement]] to act as a co-ordinating body for the states that make up the region of [[Darfur]].
*The [[Eastern Sudan States Coordinating Council]] was established by the [[Eastern Sudan Peace Agreement]] between the Sudanese Government and the rebel [[Eastern Front (Sudan)|Eastern Front]] to act as a coordinating body for the three eastern states.
*The [[Abyei|Abyei Area]], located on the border between South Sudan and the Republic of the Sudan, currently has a special administrative status and is governed by an [[Abyei Area Administration]]. It was due to hold a [[Abyei status referendum, 2011|referendum]] in 2011 on whether to join an independent [[South Sudan]] or remain part of the Republic of the Sudan.

Even with the oil profits before the secession of South Sudan, Sudan still faced formidable economic problems, and its growth was still a rise from a very low level of per capita output. The economy of Sudan has been steadily growing over the 2000s, and according to a World Bank report the overall growth in GDP in 2010 was 5.2 percent compared to 2009 growth of 4.2 percent.<ref name="cia"/> This growth was sustained even during the [[war in Darfur]] and [[Southern Sudan Autonomous Region (2005–11)|period of southern autonomy]] preceding South Sudan's independence.<ref>{{cite news |title= South Sudan Gets Ready for Independence |date=21 June 2011 |url= http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2011/06/2011621161012959115.html |accessdate=23 June 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gettleman |first=Jeffrey |title=As Secession Nears, Sudan Steps Up Drive to Stop Rebels |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/21/world/africa/21sudan.html?ref=sudan |accessdate=23 June 2011 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=20 June 2011}}</ref>
[[Petroleum|Oil]] was Sudan's main export, with production increasing dramatically during the late 2000s, in the years before South Sudan gained independence in July 2011. With rising oil revenues, the Sudanese economy was booming, with a growth rate of about nine percent in 2007.  The independence of oil-rich [[South Sudan]], however, placed most major [[oilfield]]s out of the Sudanese government's direct control and oil production in Sudan fell from around {{convert|450000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} to under {{convert|60000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. Production has since recovered to hover around {{convert|250000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}} for 2014–15.

In order to export oil, South Sudan relies on a pipeline to [[Port Sudan]] on Sudan's [[Red Sea]] coast, as South Sudan is a [[landlocked country]], as well as the oil refining facilities in Sudan. In August 2012, Sudan and South Sudan agreed a deal to transport South Sudanese oil through Sudanese pipelines to Port Sudan.<ref>''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sudan-southsudan-idUSBRE87300520120804]'', Sudan, South Sudan reach oil deal, will hold border talks</ref>

While historically agriculture remains the main source of income and employment hiring of over 80 percent of Sudanese, and makes up a third of the economic sector, oil production drove most of Sudan's post-2000 growth. Currently, the International Monetary Fund IMF is working hand in hand with Khartoum government to implement sound macroeconomic policies. This follows a turbulent period in the 1980s when debt-ridden Sudan's relations with the IMF and World Bank soured, culminating in its eventual suspension from the IMF.<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard P.

Agricultural production remains Sudan's most-important sector, employing 80 percent of the workforce and contributing 39 percent of GDP, but most farms remain rain-fed and susceptible to drought. Instability, adverse weather and weak world-agricultural prices ensures that much of the population will remain at or below the poverty line for years.

The [[Merowe Dam]], also known as Merowe Multi-Purpose Hydro Project or Hamdab Dam, is a large construction project in Northern Sudan, about {{convert|350|km}} north of the capital, Khartoum. It is situated on the River Nile, close to the [[Fourth cataract of the Nile|Fourth Cataract]] where the river divides into multiple smaller branches with large islands in between. [[Merowe, Sudan|Merowe]] is a city about {{convert|40|km}} downstream from the dam's construction site.

The main purpose of the dam will be the generation of electricity. Its dimensions make it the largest contemporary hydropower project in Africa. The construction of the dam was finished December 2008, supplying more than 90 percent of the population with electricity. Other gas-powered generating stations are operational in Khartoum State and other States.

The majority of this population came from [[Eritrea]] (240,400 people), [[Chad]] (45,000), [[Ethiopia]] (49,300) and the [[Central African Republic]] (2,500).<ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008">{{Cite news|title=World Refugee Survey 2008 |publisher=[[U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]] |date=19 June 2008 |url=http://www.refugees.org/resources/refugee-warehousing/archived-world-refugee-surveys/2008-world-refugee-survey.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019224639/http://www.refugees.org/resources/refugee-warehousing/archived-world-refugee-surveys/2008-world-refugee-survey.html |archivedate=19 October 2014 }}</ref> The Sudanese government [[UN High Commissioner for Refugees]] in 2007 forcibly deported at least 1,500 refugees and asylum seekers during the year.

Sudan has 597 groups that speak over 400 different languages and dialects.<ref>{{cite book |author= Bechtold, Peter R. |year=1991 |chapter=More Turbulence in Sudan |title=Sudan: State and Society in Crisis|editor=Voll, John |publisher=Westview Press |location =Boulder, CA |page=1}}</ref> [[Sudanese Arabs]] are by far the largest ethnic group in Sudan. They are almost entirely Muslims; while the majority speak [[Sudanese Arabic]], some other Arab tribes speak different Arabic dialects like [[Awadia and Fadnia tribes]] and [[Arakieen|Bani Arak]] tribes who speak [[Najdi Arabic]]; and [[Rufa'a]], [[Beni Ḥassān]], [[Al-Ashraf]], [[Kinanah]] and [[Rashaida]] who speak [[Hejazi Arabic]]. In addition, the Western province comprises various ethnic groups, while a few Arab [[Bedouin]] of the northern [[Rizeigat]] and others who speak Sudanese Arabic share the same culture and backgrounds of the Sudanese Arabs.

The majority of Arabized and indigenous tribes like the [[Fur people|Fur]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Borgo people|Borgo]], [[Masalit people|Masalit]] and some [[Baggara]] ethnic groups, who speak [[Chadian Arabic]], show less cultural integration because of cultural, linguistic and genealogical variations with other Arab and Arabized tribes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Suliman, Osman |title=The Darfur Conflict: Geography or Institutions?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hrn-dkM00koC&pg=PA115|year=2010|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-83616-3|page=115}}</ref>

Sudanese Arabs of Northern and Eastern parts descend primarily from migrants from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and intermarriages with the pre-existing indigenous populations of Sudan, especially the [[Nubia|Nubian people]], who also share a common history with [[Egypt]]. Additionally, a few pre-Islamic Arabian tribes existed in Sudan from earlier migrations into the region from Western Arabia, although most Arabs in Sudan are dated from migrations after the 12th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.almshaheer.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3339 |script-title=ar:وزير خارجية السودان الاسبق حسين ابوصالح ل"الشرق" : التهديدات الامريكية للسودان كانت تصلنا في ورقة صغيرة دون ترويسة اوامضاء |publisher=Almshaheer.com |language=Arabic}}</ref>

The vast majority of Arab tribes in Sudan migrated into the Sudan in the 12th century, intermarried with the indigenous Nubian and other African populations and introduced Islam.<ref name="google16">{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZSDBkKgNgx8C&pg=PA16 |title=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=17 |author=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |year=1888 |page=16 |accessdate=8 May 2011}}</ref>

Sudan consists of numerous other non-Arabic groups, such as the [[Masalit people|Masalit]], [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]], [[Fulani]], [[Northern Nubians]], [[Nuba]], and the [[Beja people]].

There is also a small, but prominent [[Greeks in Sudan|Greek community]].

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Sudan}}
[[File:Rashaida family.png|thumb|upright=0.9|The Arabic-speaking [[Rashaida people|Rashaida]] came to Sudan from [[Arabia]] about 170 years ago.]]

Approximately 70 languages are native to Sudan.<ref name="Ethnologue">Gordon, Raymond G., Jr. (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, 16th ed. Dallas: SIL International. Online version: [http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SD "Languages of Sudan"]</ref>

[[Sudanese Arabic]] is the most widely spoken language in the country. It is the [[Varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]], an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language of the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch spoken throughout Sudan. The dialect has borrowed much vocabulary from local Nilo-Saharan languages ([[Nobiin language|Nobiin]], [[Fur language|Fur]], [[Zaghawa language|Zaghawa]], [[Maba language|Mabang]]). This has resulted in a variety of Arabic that is unique to Sudan, reflecting the way in which the country has been influenced by Nilotic, Arab, and western cultures. Few nomads in Sudan still have similar accents to the ones in [[Saudi Arabia]]. Other important languages include [[Beja language|Beja]] (Bedawi) along the [[Red Sea]], with perhaps 2 million speakers. It is the only language from the Afroasiatic family's [[Cushitic language|Cushitic]] branch that is today spoken in the territory.

As with South Sudan, a number of [[Nilo-Saharan languages]] are also spoken in Sudan. [[Fur language|Fur]] speakers inhabit the west ([[Darfur]]), with perhaps a million speakers. There are likewise various [[Nubian languages]], with over 6 million speakers along the Nile in the north. The most linguistically diverse region in the country is the [[Nuba Hills]] area in Kordofan, inhabited by speakers of multiple language families, with Darfur and other border regions being second.

The [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]] family is represented by many of the [[Kordofanian languages]], and [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] by [[Domari language|Domari]] (Gypsy) and English. Historically, [[Old Nubian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] were the languages of [[Christian Nubia]], while [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] was the language of the [[Kingdom of Kush]], which conquered Egypt.

Sudan also has multiple regional sign languages, which are not [[mutually intelligible]]. A 2009 proposal for a unified [[Sudanese Sign Language]] had been worked out, but was not widely known.<ref>Karen Andrae (2009) {{YouTube|v5KZm0KrnfU| ''Language for inclusion (Sign language in Sudan)''}}</ref>

Two popular divisions of Sufism, the Ansar and the Khatmia, are associated with the opposition Umma and Democratic Unionist parties, respectively. Only the Darfur region has traditionally been bereft of the Sufi brotherhoods common in the rest of the country.<ref>Hamid Eltgani Ali, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4BNUBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA9&dq=warsh+quran&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=warsh&f=false Darfur's Political Economy: A Quest for Development], pg. 9.

Roman Catholics are 3.2% of the population and Protestants are 5% mainly in the South. Significant, long-established groups of [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] Christians exist in Khartoum and other northern cities. [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Eritrean Orthodox]] communities also exist in Khartoum and eastern Sudan, largely made up of refugees and migrants from the past few decades. The largest groups affiliated with Western Christian denominations are [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican Communion|Anglican]]. Other Christian groups with smaller followings in the country include the Africa Inland Church, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the Sudan Church of Christ, the [[Sudan Interior Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], the Sudan Pentecostal Church, the [[Sudan Evangelical Presbyterian Church]] (in the North).

Religious identity plays a role in the country's political divisions. Northern and western Muslims have dominated the country's political and economic system since independence. The NCP draws much of its support from [[Islamists]], [[Salafis]]/[[Wahhabis]] and other conservative Arab Muslims in the north. The [[Ummah|Umma]] Party has traditionally attracted Arab followers of the Ansar sect of Sufism as well as non-Arab Muslims from Darfur and Kordofan. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) includes both Arab and non-Arab Muslims in the north and east, especially those in the Khatmia Sufi sect.

==Culture==
{{Further|Music of Sudan|List of Sudanese writers|List of Sudanese singers}}
Sudanese culture melds the behaviors, practices, and beliefs of about 578 ethnic groups, communicating in 145 different languages, in a region microcosmic of Africa, with geographic extremes varying from sandy desert to tropical forest.
Recent evidence suggests that while most citizens of the country identify strongly with both Sudan and their religion, Arab and African supranational identities are much more polarising and contested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/economics/research/working-papers/2014-papers/21-14.pdf|title=Hamilton, A. and Hudson, J.

===Music===
{{main|Music of Sudan}} 
[[File:Drummer at Hamed el-Nil Mosque (8625532075).jpg|thumb|A [[Sufi]] [[dervish]] drums up the Friday afternoon crowd in [[Omdurman]].]]
Sudan has a rich and unique musical culture that has been through chronic instability and repression during the modern history of Sudan. Beginning with the imposition of strict [[Salafi]] interpretation of ''[[sharia]]'' law in 1989, many of the country's most prominent poets, like [[Mahjoub Sharif]], were imprisoned while others, like [[Mohammed el Amin]] (returned to Sudan in the mid-1990s) and [[Mohammed Wardi]] (returned to Sudan 2003), fled to Cairo. Traditional music suffered too, with traditional [[Zār]] ceremonies being interrupted and drums confiscated {{ref_label|roughguide|1|a}}. At the same time European militaries contributed to the development of Sudanese music by introducing new instruments and styles; military bands, especially the Scottish [[bagpipes]], were renowned, and set traditional music to [[march (music)|military march]] music. The march ''March Shulkawi No 1'', is an example, set to the sounds of the [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]]. In northern Sudan  different music from the rest of Sudan, is used as a type of music called '''(Aldlayib)''' used a musical instrument called '''(Tambur)''' are industry manually and has five strings and is made from wood and made wonderful music accompanied by the voices of human applause and singing artists give a perfect blend gives the area Northern State special character.

===Sport===
The most popular sports in Sudan are athletics ([[track and field]]) and [[Association football|football]].  Though not as successful as football, [[basketball]], [[team handball|handball]], and [[volleyball]] are also popular in Sudan. In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Sudan national basketball team|national basketball team]] finished among the continent's top teams. Nowadays, it is only a minor force.

Sudanese football has a long history.  Sudan was one of the four African nations – the others being Egypt, Ethiopia and South Africa – which formed African football.  Sudan hosted the first [[African Cup of Nations]] in 1956, and has won the African Cup Of Nations once, in 1970.  Two years later, the Sudan National Football Team participated in the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]]. The [[Khartoum|nation's capital]] is home to the Khartoum League, which is considered to be the oldest football league in Africa.

Sudanese football teams such as [[Al-Hilal Club (Omdurman)|Al-Hilal]], [[Al-Merrikh SC|Al-Merrikh]], and Abdelgadir Osman FC are among the nation's strongest teams.  Other teams like Khartoum, El-Neel, [[Al-Nidal El-Nahud]] and [[Hay-Al Arab]], are also starting to grow in popularity.

===Clothing===
Most individual Sudanese wear either traditional or western attire. A traditional garb widely worn in Sudan is the [[jalabiya]], which is a loose-fitting, long-sleeved, collarless ankle-length garment also common to [[Egypt]].  The jalabiya is accompanied by a large scarf worn by women, and the garment may be white, colored, striped, and made of fabric varying in thickness, depending on the season of the year and personal preferences.

A similar garment common to Sudan is the ''thobe'' or ''[[thawb]]'', pronounced ''tobe'' in Sudanese dialect.  The thobe is a long one piece cloth that women wrap around their inner garments.  The word "thawb" means "garment" in Arabic.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Sudan}}
[[File:Faculty of Science (University of Khartoum) 002.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[Khartoum University]] established in 1902]]
Education in Sudan is free and compulsory for children aged 6 to 13 years.although more than 40% of children are not going to schools due to economical situation caused by the regime. Primary education consists of eight years, followed by three years of secondary education. The former educational ladder 6 + 3 + 3 was changed in 1990. The primary language at all levels is Arabic. Schools are concentrated in urban areas; many in the West have been damaged or destroyed by years of civil war. In 2001 the World Bank estimated that primary enrollment was 46 percent of eligible pupils and 21 percent of secondary students. Enrollment varies widely, falling below 20 percent in some provinces. The literacy rate is 70.2% of total population, male: 79.6%, female: 60.8%.<ref name="cia" />

=== Science and research ===
Sudan has around 25–30 universities; instruction is primarily in Arabic. Education at the secondary and university levels has been seriously hampered by the requirement that most males perform military service before completing their education.<ref name="cp">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Sudan.pdf |title=Sudan country profile |publisher=Library of Congress Federal Research Division |date=December 2004 |accessdate=31 May 2013}}</ref> In addition, the "islamization" encouraged by president Al-Bashir alienated many researchers: the official language of instruction in universities was changed from English to Arabic and Islamic courses became mandatory. Internal science funding withered.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Nordling|first=Linda|date=2017-12-15|title=Sudan seeks a science revival|journal=Science|language=en|volume=358|issue=6369|pages=1369|doi=10.1126/science.358.6369.1369|issn=0036-8075|pmid=29242326|bibcode=2017Sci...358.1369N}}</ref> According to [[UNESCO]], more than 3000 Sudanese researchers left the country between 2002 and 2014. By 2013, the country had a mere 19 researchers for every 100,000 citizens, or 1/30 the ratio of [[Egypt]], according to the Sudanese National Centre for Research. In 2015, Sudan published only about 500 scientific papers.<ref name=":0" /> For comparison, [[Poland]], a country of similar population size, publishes on the order of 10,000 papers per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/the-top-20-countries-for-scientific-output|title=The top 20 countries for scientific output|website=www.openaccessweek.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16}}</ref>

==Health care==

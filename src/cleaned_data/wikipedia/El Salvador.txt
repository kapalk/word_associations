'''El Salvador''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-El Salvador.ogg|ɛ|l|_|ˈ|s|æ|l|v|ə|d|ɔr}}; {{IPA-es|el salβaˈðoɾ|lang}}), officially the '''Republic of El Salvador''' ({{lang-es|República de El Salvador}}, literally "Republic of The Savior"), is the smallest and the most [[population density|densely]] populated country in [[Central America]]. It is bordered on the northeast by [[Honduras]], on the northwest by [[Guatemala]], and on the south by the [[Pacific Ocean]].  El Salvador's capital and largest city is [[San Salvador]]. {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}}}, the country had a population of approximately {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|El Salvador}}|R}}/1e6 round 2}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}}

El Salvador was for centuries inhabited by several [[Mesoamerican]] nations, especially the [[Pipil people|Cuzcatlecs]], as well as the [[Lenca]] and [[Maya people|Maya]]. In the early 16th century, the [[Spanish Empire]] conquered the territory, incorporating it into the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] ruled from [[Mexico City]]. However the Viceroyalty of Mexico had little or no influence in the daily affairs of the Central American isthmus, which would be colonized in 1524. In 1609 the area became the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], from which El Salvador was part of until its independence from Spain, which took place in 1821, as part of the [[First Mexican Empire]], then further seceded, as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], in 1823. When the Republic dissolved in 1841, El Salvador became a sovereign nation, then formed a short-lived union with [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] called the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which lasted from 1895 to 1898.<ref name="Boland2001">{{cite book|author=Roy Boland|title=Culture and Customs of El Salvador|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16DV3GDkKu8C&pg=PA2|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30620-4|page=2}}</ref><ref name="IhrieOropesa2011">{{cite book|author1=Maureen Ihrie|author2=Salvador Oropesa|title=World Literature in Spanish: An Encyclopedia &#91;3 volumes&#93;: An Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPDFHE_5besC&pg=PA332|date=20 October 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-08083-8|page=332}}</ref><ref name="Haskin2012">{{cite book|author=Jeanne M.

From the late 19th to the mid-20th century, El Salvador endured chronic political and [[economic stability|economic instability]] characterized by coups, revolts, and a succession of [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] rulers. Persistent [[social inequality|socioeconomic inequality]] and civil unrest culminated in the devastating [[Salvadoran Civil War]] (1979–1992), which was fought between the military-led government and a coalition of left-wing [[guerilla warfare|guerrilla]] groups. The conflict ended with the [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]]. This negotiated settlement established a multiparty constitutional republic, which remains in place to this day.

===Prehistoric===
[[File:Toma2.gif|thumb|Excavation of a [[Megatherium]] in the Tomayate site [[Apopa]].]]
[[File:Toma4.gif|thumb|Skull fossil of an ancient-horse in the Tomayate site [[Apopa]].]]
Tomayate is a paleontological site located on the banks of the river of the same name in the municipality of [[Apopa]]. The site has produced abundant Salvadoran [[megafauna]] fossils belonging to the [[Pleistocene epoch]]. The paleontological site was discovered accidentally in 2000, and in the following year, an excavation by the Museum of Natural History of El Salvador revealed not only several remnants of [[Cuvieronius]], but also several other species of vertebrates. In the Tomayate site, they have recovered at least 19 species of vertebrates, including [[giant tortoises]], [[Megatherium]], [[Glyptodon]], [[Toxodon]], extinct horses, paleo-llamas and especially a large number of skeletal remains of proboscis genus [[Cuvieronius]]. The Tomayate site stands out from most Central American [[Pleistocene]] deposits, being more ancient and much richer, which provides valuable information of the [[Great American Interchange]], in which the [[Central American]] isthmus landbridge played the title primordial role. At the same time, it is considered the richest vertebrate paleontological site in Central America and one of the largest accumulations of [[proboscidea]]ns in the Americas.

Sophisticated civilization in El Salvador dates to its settlement by the indigenous [[Lenca people]]; theirs was the first and the oldest indigenous civilization to settle in El Salvador. The Lenca were succeeded by the [[Olmec]]s, who eventually also disappeared, leaving their monumental architecture in the form of the pyramids still extant in western El Salvador. The Maya arrived and settled in place of the Olmecs, but their numbers were greatly diminished when the [[Lake Ilopango|Ilopango]] supervolcano eruption caused a massive Mayan exodus out of what is now El Salvador.<ref name="Campbell1985"/>

{{main|Spanish conquest of El Salvador}}
[[File:Pedro de Alvarado.JPG|thumb|upright|Spanish Conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]].]]
In 1524, after participating in the [[conquest of Mexico]], Spanish [[conquistadors]] led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] and his brother Gonzalo crossed the [[Paz River|Rio Paz]] (Peace River) from the area comprising the present Republic of Guatemala into what is now the Republic of El Salvador. The Spaniards were disappointed to discover that the indigenous [[Pipil people]] had no gold or jewels like those they had found in Guatemala or Mexico, but recognized the richness of the land's volcanic soil.

Pedro de Alvarado led the first incursion by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of [[Cuzcatlan]] (El Salvador), in June 1524.<ref name="NicholsPool2012">

When he arrived at the borders of the Cuzcatlan kingdom he saw that civilians had been evacuated. Cuzcatlec warriors moved to the coastal city of [[Acajutla]] and waited for Alvarado and his forces. Alvarado approached, confident that the result would be similar to what occurred in Mexico and Guatemala where the people believed the Spanish were gods. He thought he would easily defeat this new indigenous force since his Mexican allies and the Pipil of Cuzcatlan spoke a similar language.

The Indigenous peoples of El Salvador did not see the Spanish as gods, but as foreign invaders. Alvarado saw that the Cuzcatan force outnumbered his Spanish soldiers and Mexican Indian allies. The Spanish withdrew and the Cuzcatlec army attacked, running behind them with war chants and shooting bow arrows. Alvarado had no choice but to fight to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Alvarado described the Cuzcatlec soldiers in great detail as having shields made of colorful exotic feathers, a vest-like armor made of three inch cotton which arrows could not penetrate, and large spears. Both armies suffered many casualties, with a wounded Alvarado retreating and losing a lot of his men, especially among the Mexican Indian auxiliaries. Once his army had regrouped, Alvarado decided to head to the Cuzcatlan capital and again faced armed Cuzcatlec. Wounded, unable to fight and hiding in the cliffs, Alvarado sent his Spanish men on their horses to approach the Cuzcatlec to see if they would fear the horses, but they did not retreat, Alvarado recalls in his letters to Hernan Cortez.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Cuzcatlec attacked again, and on this occasion stole Spanish weaponry. Alvarado retreated and sent Mexican Indian messengers to demand that the Cuzcatlec warriors return the stolen weapons and surrender to the Spanish king. The Cuzcatlec responded with the famous response, "If you want your weapons, come get them". As days passed, Alvarado, fearing an ambush, sent more Mexican Indian messengers to negotiate, but these messengers never came back and were presumably executed.

[[File:Templo tazumal.jpg|thumb|[[Tazumal]] ruins in Santa Ana, El Salvador.]]
The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan-speaking neighbors. They defeated the Spaniards and what was left of their Mexican [[Tlaxcala]] Indian allies, forcing them to withdraw to Guatemala. After being wounded, Alvarado abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) brought the Pipil under Spanish control, since the Pipil also were weakened by a regional epidemic of [[smallpox]]. In 1525, the conquest of Cuzcatlán was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. The Spanish faced much resistance from the Pipil and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas.

In 1526 the Spanish founded the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by another explorer and conquistador, [[Luis de Moscoso Alvarado]], nephew of Pedro Alvarado. Oral history holds that a Maya-Lenca crown princess, Antu Silan Ulap I, organized resistance to the conquistadors.<ref>

</ref> The kingdom of Lenca was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan travelled from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present-day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and overwhelming numbers, they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison.

For ten years the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of [[Intibucá]].

Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and using their weapons captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until he was killed in battle. The remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.

=== Spanish rule (1525–1821)===
[[File:Proclama de libertad (indep. Centroamérica).jpg|thumb|A painting of the First Independence Movement celebration in San Salvador. At the center, [[José Matías Delgado]].]]
[[File:MANUEL JOSE ARCE PICTURE.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Manuel José Arce]] joined the movement for independence from Spain, joining in the first Cry for Independence on November 5, 1811 in San Salvador.]]

During the colonial period, El Salvador was part of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala ({{lang-es|Reino de Guatemala}}), created in 1609 as an administrative division of [[New Spain]]. The Salvadoran territory was administered by the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an ''[[intendancy|intendancia]]'' in 1786.

Towards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the long-standing Creole aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the 18th century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.

In November 1811 Salvadoran priest [[José Matías Delgado]] rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again this insurrection was also suppressed.

In 1821 in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the [[Act of Independence of Central America]], which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its independence. In 1821, El Salvador joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].

In early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[Agustín de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote to join Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces. (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture.)

When the Federal Republic of Central America dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which dissolved in 1898.

After the mid-19th century, the economy was based on coffee growing. As the world market for indigo withered away, the economy prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land into the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.<ref>

Throughout the last half of the 19th century, a succession of [[president]]s from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy, nominally both [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[liberalism|liberal]], generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant [[cash crop]], the development of infrastructure ([[railroad]]s and [[sea port|port facilities]]) primarily in support of the coffee trade, the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, the passage of anti-[[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws to ensure that displaced [[Peasant|campesinos]] and other rural residents provided sufficient [[labour (economics)|labor]] for the coffee fincas ([[plantation]]s), and the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.

===20th century===
[[File:Tomás Regalado.jpg|thumb|Gen. Tomás Regalado]]
In 1898, Gen. [[Tomás Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] gained power by force, deposing [[Rafael Antonio Gutiérrez]] and ruling as president until 1903. Once in office he revived the practice of presidents designating their successors. After serving his term, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed July 11, 1906, at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala. Until 1913 El Salvador was politically stable, with undercurrents of popular discontent. When President Dr. [[Manuel Enrique Araujo]] was killed in 1913, many hypotheses were advanced for the political motive of his murder.

[[File:Civil Ensign of El Salvador.svg|thumb|upright|Dios, Union, Libertad (God, Union, Liberty) El Salvador 1912 Flag.]]
Araujo's administration was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government and a trusted collaborator of the dynasty, succeeded President [[Jorge Meléndez]] and in 1930 announced free elections, in which [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on March 1, 1931 in what was considered the country's first freely contested election. His government lasted only nine months before it was overthrown by junior military officers who accused his Labor Party of lacking political and governmental experience and of using its government offices inefficiently. President Araujo faced general popular discontent, as the people had expected economic reforms and the redistribution of land. There were demonstrations in front of the National Palace from the first week of his administration. His vice president and minister of war was Gen. [[Maximiliano Hernández Martínez]].

In December 1931, a [[coup d'état]] organized by junior officers and led by Gen. Martínez started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador. Only the First Regiment of Cavalry and the National Police defended the presidency (the National Police had been on its payroll), but later that night, after hours of fighting, the badly outnumbered defenders surrendered to rebel forces.

The Directorate, composed of officers, hid behind a shadowy figure,<ref>

The revolt was probably due to the army's discontent at not having been paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and unsuccessfully tried to organize forces to defeat the revolt.

The U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Martínez, which agreed to hold presidential elections. He resigned six months prior to running for re-election, winning back the presidency as the only candidate on the ballot. He ruled from 1935 to 1939, then from 1939 to 1943. He began a fourth term in 1944, but resigned in May after a general strike. Martínez had said he was going to respect the Constitution, which stipulated he could not be re-elected, but he refused to keep his promise.

From December 1931, the year of the coup that brought Martínez to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]], originally led by [[Farabundo Martí]] and Abel Cuenca, and university students Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata, but these leaders were captured before the planned insurrection. Only Cuenca survived; the other insurgents were killed by the government. After the capture of the movement leaders, the insurrection erupted in a disorganized and mob-controlled fashion, resulting in government repression that was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (The Massacre), because tens of thousands of peasants died in the ensuing chaos on the orders of President Martinez.

In the unstable political climate of the previous few years, the social activist and revolutionary leader [[Farabundo Martí]] helped found the Communist Party of Central America, and led a Communist alternative to the Red Cross called International Red Aid, serving as one of its representatives. Their goal was to help poor and underprivileged Salvadorans through the use of [[Marxist-Leninist]] ideology (strongly rejecting [[Stalinism]]). In December 1930, at the height of the country's economic and social depression, Martí was once again exiled due to his popularity among the nation's poor and rumors of his upcoming nomination for President the following year. Once Arturo Araujo was elected president in 1931, Martí returned to El Salvador, and along with Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata began the movement that was later truncated by the military.

[[File:Jose Napoleon Duarte.png|thumb|upright|[[José Napoleón Duarte]].]]
They helped start a guerrilla revolt of indigenous farmers. The government responded by [[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|killing over 30,000 people]] at what was to have been a "peaceful meeting" in 1932; this became known as La Matanza (The Slaughter). The peasant uprising against Martínez was crushed by the Salvadoran military ten days after it had begun. The Communist-led rebellion, fomented by collapsing coffee prices, enjoyed some initial success, but was soon drowned in a bloodbath. President Martínez, who had himself toppled an elected government only weeks earlier, ordered the defeated Martí shot after a perfunctory hearing.

Historically, the high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighboring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between the two countries.<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm El Salvador – Demographics]".

The [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC) and the [[National Conciliation Party]] (PCN) were active in Salvadoran politics from 1960 until 2011, when they were disbanded by the Supreme Court because they had failed to win enough votes in the 2004 presidential election;<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=El Salvador Supreme Court disbands two parties |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-13251247 |publisher=BBC News |date=2011-04-30 |accessdate=2014-07-02 }}</ref> Both parties have since reconstituted.  They share common ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the interests of the Salvadoran military.

PDC leader [[José Napoleón Duarte]] was the mayor of [[San Salvador]] from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the regime of PCN President [[Julio Adalberto Rivera Carballo]], who allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly. Duarte later ran for president with a political grouping called the [[National Opposition Union]] (UNO) but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections. He lost to the ex-Minister of Interior, Col. [[Arturo Armando Molina]], in an election that was widely viewed as fraudulent; Molina was declared the winner even though Duarte was said to have received a majority of the votes. Duarte, at some army officers' request, supported a revolt to protest the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled. Duarte returned to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working on projects in Venezuela as an engineer.

=== Salvadoran Civil War (1979–1992)===
{{Further|Salvadoran Civil War}}

In October 1979, a [[coup d'état]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway in response to Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed [[agrarian reform]], and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the army such as [[El Salvador Civil War|Gen. Majano and Gen. Gutierrez]],<ref>[http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6351&idArt=4199885 Román Mayorga Assume Embajada en Venezuela]. www.elsalvador.com.

[[File:Masakro-ĉe-Suchitoto-Salvadoro.jpg|thumb|left|A billboard serving as a reminder of one of many [[List of massacres in El Salvador|massacres]] that occurred during the civil war.]]
Pressure from the oligarchy soon dissolved the junta because of its inability to control the army in its repression of the people fighting for unionization rights, agrarian reform, better wages, accessible health care and freedom of expression. In the meantime, the guerrilla movement was spreading to all sectors of Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); and workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block). In October 1980, several other major guerrilla groups of the Salvadoran left had formed the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]], or FMLN. By the end of the 1970s, death squads were killing about 10 people each day, and the FMLN had 6,000 – 8,000 active guerrillas and hundreds of thousands of part-time militia, supporters, and sympathizers.<ref>

The U.S. supported and financed the creation of a second junta to change the political environment and stop the spread of a leftist insurrection. Napoleón Duarte was recalled from his exile in Venezuela to head this new junta. However, a revolution was already underway and his new role as head of the junta was seen by the general population as opportunistic. He was unable to influence the outcome of the insurrection. [[Óscar Romero]], Archbishop of San Salvador, denounced injustices and massacres committed against civilians by government forces. He was considered "the voice of the voiceless", but he was assassinated by a [[death squad]] while saying Mass on 24 March 1980.<ref>

On January 16, 1992, the government of El Salvador, represented by president [[Alfredo Cristiani]], and the [[FMLN]], represented by the commanders of the five guerrilla groups – [[Shafik Handal]], [[Joaquín Villalobos]], [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]], Francisco Jovel and [[Fermán Cienfuegos|Eduardo Sancho]], all signed peace agreements brokered by the United Nations ending the 12-year civil war. This event, held at [[Chapultepec Castle]] in Mexico, was attended by U.N. dignitaries and other representatives of the international community. After signing the armistice, the president stood up and shook hands with all the now ex-guerrilla commanders, an action which was widely admired.

=== Post-war (1992–present) ===
The so-called [[Chapultepec Peace Accords]] mandated reductions in the size of the army, and the dissolution of the National Police, the Treasury Police, the National Guard and the Civilian Defense, a paramilitary group. A new Civil Police was to be organized. Judicial immunity for crimes committed by the armed forces ended; the government agreed to submit to the recommendations of a [[Commission on the Truth for El Salvador]] ''(Comisión de la Verdad Para El Salvador)'', which would "investigate serious acts of violence occurring since 1980, and the nature and effects of the violence, and...recommend methods of promoting national reconciliation." In 1993 the Commission delivered its findings reporting human rights violations on both sides of the conflict.<ref>From madness to hope: the 12-year war in El Salvador, Part IV. Cases and patterns of violence, Truth Commissions Digital Collection: Reports: El Salvador, United States Institute of Peace. Retrieved 2008-07-16</ref> Five days later the El Salvadoran legislature passed an amnesty law for all acts of violence during the period.

From 1989 until 2004, Salvadorans favored the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) party, voting in ARENA presidents in every election ([[Alfredo Cristiani]], [[Armando Calderón Sol]], [[Francisco Flores Pérez]], [[Antonio Saca]]) until 2009, when [[Mauricio Funes]] was elected president from the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) party.

Economic reforms since the early 1990s brought major benefits in terms of improved social conditions, diversification of the export sector, and access to international financial markets at investment grade level. Crime remains a major problem for the investment climate.

This{{clarify|date=July 2016}} all ended in 2001, and support for ARENA weakened. Internal turmoil in ARENA weakened the party also, while the FMLN united and broadened its support.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/ELSALVADOREXTN/0,,menuPK:295253~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:295244,00.html

The unsuccessful attempts of the left-wing party to win presidential elections led to its selection of a journalist rather than a former guerrilla leader as a candidate. On March 15, 2009, [[Mauricio Funes]], a television figure, became the first president from the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party. He was inaugurated on June 1, 2009. One focus of the Funes government has been revealing the alleged corruption from the past government.<ref>

ARENA formally expelled Saca from the party in December 2009. With 12 loyalists in the National Assembly, Saca established his own party, GANA (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional or [[Grand Alliance for National Unity]]), and entered into a tactical legislative alliance with the FMLN.<ref>United States Embassy San Salvador, "ARENA Expels Former President Saca," classified diplomatic cable, December 15, 2009, released by WikiLeaks, [http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR1103&q=saca Cable ID 09SANSALVADOR1103] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116213337/http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR1103&q=saca |date=2013-01-16 }}.</ref> After three years in office, with Saca's GANA party providing the FMLN with a legislative majority, Funes had not taken action to either investigate or to bring corrupt former officials to justice.

Early in the new millennium, El Salvador's government created the Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales – the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (MARN) and began promoting the integration of climate change into national policy. This move was in response to the increase in extreme weather events affecting the country. Initially MARN aimed to fulfil the country's obligations following its ratification of the [[UNFCCC]] and the [[Kyoto protocol]] However, since Hurricane Ida in 2009, the government's stance has shifted towards integrating risk reduction into all areas of policy, including financial.<ref name="cdkn.org">[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb ''El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future''] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref>

In a specific effort to increase the resilience of its economy and people to climate-related events, El Salvador commissioned a project in 2011 to develop and implement a National Policy and Strategy for Climate Change, which culminated with the launch of the National Environmental Policy in June 2012 and the National Environmental Strategy in June 2013, both incorporating climate change goals. This work was undertaken with support from the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]]. The government is now preparing action plans for putting the strategy into practice.<ref name="cdkn.org"/>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of El Salvador}}
[[File:Cerro verde.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.00|Panoramic of [[Coatepeque Caldera]], Cerro Verde and [[Izalco (volcano)]]]]

[[File:Un-el-salvador.png|thumb|A map of El Salvador]]
El Salvador lies in the isthmus of Central America between latitudes [[13th parallel north|13°]] and [[15th parallel north|15°N]], and longitudes [[87th meridian west|87°]] and [[91st meridian west|91°W]]. It stretches {{convert|168|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} from west-northwest to east-southeast and {{convert|88|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} north to south, with a total area of {{convert|21,041|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. As the smallest country in continental America, El Salvador is affectionately called ''Pulgarcito de America'' (the "[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas"). The highest point in El Salvador is [[Cerro El Pital]], at {{convert|8,957|ft|m|order=flip}}, on the border with [[Honduras]].

El Salvador has a long history of [[List of earthquakes in El Salvador|destructive earthquakes]] and volcanic eruptions. The capital San Salvador was destroyed in 1756 and 1854, and it suffered heavy damage in the 1919, 1982, and 1986 tremors. El Salvador has over twenty volcanoes, two of them, San Miguel and [[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco]], active in recent years. From the early 19th century to the mid-1950s, Izalco erupted with a regularity that earned it the name "Lighthouse of the Pacific." Its brilliant flares were clearly visible for great distances at sea, and at night its glowing lava turned it into a brilliant luminous cone.

El Salvador has over 300 rivers, the most important of which is the Rio Lempa. Originating in Guatemala, the Rio Lempa cuts across the northern range of mountains, flows along much of the central plateau, and cuts through the southern volcanic range to empty into the Pacific. It is El Salvador's only navigable river. It and its tributaries drain about half of the country's area. Other rivers are generally short and drain the Pacific lowlands or flow from the central plateau through gaps in the southern mountain range to the Pacific. These include the [[Goascorán River|Goascorán]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[Río Grande de San Miguel]].

There are several lakes enclosed by volcanic craters in El Salvador, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&nbsp;km²) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&nbsp;km²). [[Lake Güija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&nbsp;km²). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[Cerrón Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse Cerrón Grande]] (135&nbsp;km²). There are a total {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}} of water within El Salvador's borders.

El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras, the total national boundary length is {{convert|339|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}: {{convert|126|mi|km}} with Guatemala and {{convert|213|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} with Honduras. It is the only Central American country that has no Caribbean coastline. The coastline on the Pacific is {{convert|191|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long.

Two parallel mountain ranges cross El Salvador to the west with a central plateau between them and a narrow coastal plain hugging the Pacific. These physical features divide the country into two physiographic regions. The mountain ranges and central [[plateau]], covering 85% of the land, comprise the interior highlands. The remaining coastal plains are referred to as the Pacific lowlands.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}
[[File:El Salvador Topography.png|thumb|El Salvador's topography.]]

El Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October; this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this period; yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as 2170&nbsp;mm.

The best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure systems formed over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.

From November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of its precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy, and the country experiences hot weather, excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures will be cool. In the extreme northeastern part of the country near [[Cerro El Pital]], snow is known to fall during summer as well as during winter due to the high elevations (it is the coldest part of the country).

===Natural disasters===

====Extreme weather events====
[[File:Salcoatitán, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|Volcanic range, [[Cordillera de Apaneca]], view from [[Salcoatitán]]]]
El Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe [[drought]]s, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] effects. Severe deforestation and soil erosion have made the landscape vulnerable to landslides and forest fires. These characteristics, coupled with severe fiscal constraints, make the nation highly susceptible to the impacts of extreme weather events.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/12/el-salvador-builds-resilience-in-face-of-a-stormy-future/?loclang=en_gb El Salvador builds resilience in the face of a stormy future] [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], 24 December 2013</ref>

In the summer of 2001 a severe drought destroyed 80% of El Salvador's crops, causing [[famine]] in the countryside.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702202332/http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|title=El Salvador|work=Fiu.edu|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> On October 4, 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and [[landslide]]s, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.<ref name="tdfiyp"/> In 2010, losses to agriculture from flooding exceeded US$100 million, while those resulting from drought were US$38 million.<ref>''Winds of change for facing climate change in El Salvador: Foundations for a National Strategy'', 2012.</ref>

El Salvador's location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to severe storms and [[hurricane]]s coming off the Caribbean. Since the 1990s, there has been an increase in the frequency and duration of storms, as well as a marked change in the pattern of their occurrence. Hurricanes used to strike El Salvador infrequently, only came from the Atlantic and were limited to the months of September and October. However, since the mid 1990s, such storms have occurred more frequently, originated in both the Atlantic and Pacific, and have struck in six different months of the year.<ref name="cdkn.org"/>

====Earthquakes and volcanic activity====
[[File:Vulkan Chaparrastique, El Salvador 2013 01.JPG|thumb|[[San Miguel (volcano)|San Miguel]] volcano in 2013]]
El Salvador lies along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and is thus subject to significant [[tectonic plate|tectonic]] activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity.

El Salvador's most recent destructive volcanic eruption took place on October 1, 2005, when the [[Santa Ana Volcano]] spewed a cloud of ash, hot mud and rocks that fell on nearby villages and caused two deaths. The most severe volcanic eruption in this area occurred in the 5th century AD when the [[Ilopango (volcano)|Ilopango]] volcano erupted with a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] strength of 6, producing widespread [[pyroclastic flow]]s and devastating [[Maya civilization|Mayan cities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dull|first=Robert A.|year=2001|title=Volcanism, Ecology and Culture: A Reassessment of the Volcan Ilopango Tbj eruption in the Southern Maya Realm|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=12 |issue=1|pages=25–44|doi=10.2307/971755|author2=Southon|author3=Sheets}}</ref>

The British [[Imperial College London|Imperial College's]] [[El Salvador Project]] aims to build earthquake-proof buildings in remote areas of the country.

===Biodiversity and endangered species===
[[File:motmot1.jpg|thumb|upright|The torogoz is El Salvador's national bird.]]

There are eight species of sea turtles in the world; six of them nest on the coasts of Central America, and four make their home on the Salvadoran coast: the [[leatherback turtle]] (''Dermochelys coriacea''), the [[hawksbill turtle|hawksbill]] (''Eretmochelys imbricata''), the [[Galapagos green turtle|green sea turtle (black)]] (''Chelonia agasizzii'') and the [[olive ridley sea turtle|olive ridley]] (''Lepidochelys olivacea''). Of these four species, the most common is the olive ridley turtle, followed by the green sea turtle. The other two species, hawksbill and leatherback, are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered, while the olive ridley and green sea turtle are in danger of extinction.

Recent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country's biological diversity. In 1997, the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending.{{when|date=July 2016}} In addition, a number of non-governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country's most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura, which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.

Despite these efforts, much remains to be done.

It is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish in El Salvador.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of El Salvador}}
The 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador has a democratic and representative government, whose three bodies are:
[[File:Sesion Solemne de Legislatura 2015-2018 (17866066655).jpg|thumb|Salvadoran cadets in the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador]]
# The Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic, who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected to only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Ministers whom he appoints, and is also the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.
#  The Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral), consisting of 84 deputies.
#  The Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of the Judiciary.
#
After the Civil War, the Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defense of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the ''Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional'' (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.

The political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform, multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador|President]], currently [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[Forms of government|government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]]. The country also has an independent [[Judiciary]] and [[Supreme Court of El Salvador|Supreme Court]].

===Political culture===
{{Further|List of political parties in El Salvador}}
[[File:Embajador de Rusia 02 (24546541052).jpg|thumb|El Salvador's president [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]] (left) with Russian ambassador to Nicaragua]]
El Salvador has a [[multi-party system]]. Two [[political parties]], the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) and the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front]] (FMLN) have tended to dominate elections. [[Nationalist Republican Alliance|ARENA]] candidates won four consecutive presidential elections until the election of [[Mauricio Funes]] of the FMLN in March 2009. The FMLN Party is Leftist in ideology, and is split between the dominant [[Marxist-Leninist]] faction in the legislature, and the [[Social liberalism|social liberal]] wing led by President Funes.

Geographically, [[Departments of El Salvador|the departments]] of the Central region, especially the capital and the coastal regions, known as departamentos rojos, or red departments, are relatively Leftist. The departamentos azules, or blue departments in the east, western and highland regions are relatively conservative. The winner of the [[Salvadoran presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]], [[Salvador Sánchez Cerén]] belongs to the FMLN party. In the 2015 elections for mayors and members of the National Assembly, ARENA appeared to be the winner with tight control of the National Assembly.

El Salvador is a member of the [[United Nations]] and several of its specialized agencies, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), the [[Central American Common Market]] (CACM), the [[Central American Parliament]] (PARLACEN), and the [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA). It actively participates in the Central American Security Commission (CASC), which seeks to promote regional arms control.

El Salvador also is a member of the [[World Trade Organization]] and is pursuing regional free trade agreements. An active participant in the [[Summit of the Americas]] process, El Salvador chairs a [[working group]] on market access under the [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] initiative.

=== Military ===

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of El Salvador}}
[[File:El Salvador Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A proportional representation of El Salvador's exports]]
El Salvador's economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, by government policies that mandate large economic subsidies, and by official corruption. Subsidies became such a problem that in April 2012, the International Monetary Fund suspended a $750 million loan to the central government. President [[Mauricio Funes|Funes]]' chief of cabinet, Alex Segovia, acknowledged that the economy was at the "point of collapse."<ref>[http://www.laprensagrafica.com/economia/nacional/259909-fmi-suspende-acuerdo-de-prestamo-con-el-pais.html FMI suspende acuerdo de préstamo con el país] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702214809/http://www.laprensagrafica.com/economia/nacional/259909-fmi-suspende-acuerdo-de-prestamo-con-el-pais.html |date=2012-07-02 }}, La Prensa Grafica (2012-04-26).</ref>

[[Antiguo Cuscatlán]] has the highest per capita income of all the cities in the country, and is a center of international investment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

GDP in [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) in 2008 was estimated at US$25.895 billion. The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 64.1%, followed by the industrial sector at 24.7% (2008 est.). Agriculture represents only 11.2% of GDP (2010 est.)

The [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] grew after 1996 at an annual rate that averaged 3.2% real growth. The government committed to [[free market]] initiatives, and the 2007 GDP's real growth rate was 4.7%.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gross Domestic Product, annual rates, main economic sectors |publisher=[[Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador]] |url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/sr_produccion.html |accessdate=2007-11-17| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107150307/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/sr_produccion.html| archivedate = November 7, 2007}}</ref>

In December 1999, net international reserves equaled US$1.8 billion or roughly five months of imports. Having this hard currency buffer to work with, the Salvadoran government undertook a monetary integration plan beginning January 1, 2001 by which the U.S. dollar became legal tender alongside the [[Salvadoran colón]], and all formal accounting was done in U.S. dollars. Thus, the government has formally limited the implementing of open market monetary policies to influence short-term variables in the economy. As of September 2007, net [[international reserve system|international reserves]] stood at $2.42 billion.<ref name = "tdfiyp"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Saldos a fin de año o mes|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|language=Spanish|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/estadisticas/Sector_externo/sectorexterno_reservasint_anual.html|accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014022202/http://bcr.gob.sv/estadisticas/Sector_externo/sectorexterno_reservasint_anual.html|archivedate=October 14, 2007}}</ref>

It has long been a challenge in El Salvador to develop new growth sectors for a more diversified economy. In the past, the country produced gold and silver,<ref>Dan Oancea (January 2009). [http://magazine.mining.com/Issues/0901/MiningCentralAmerica.pdf Mining in Central America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516031334/http://magazine.mining.com/Issues/0901/MiningCentralAmerica.pdf |date=2011-05-16 }}. MINING.com</ref> but recent attempts to reopen the mining sector, which were expected to add hundreds of millions of dollars to the local economy, collapsed after President Saca shut down the operations of [[Pacific Rim Mining Corporation]].  Nevertheless, according to the Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (Instituto Centroamericano for Estudios Fiscales, by its acronym in Spanish), the contribution of metallic mining was a minuscule 0.3% of the country's GDP between 2010 and 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://icefi.org/noticias/estudio-sobre-mineria-metalica-en-triangulo-norte-se-presenta-en-el-salvador|title=Estudio sobre minería metálica en triángulo norte se presenta en El Salvador|date=7 April 2017|publisher=}}</ref> Saca's decision although not lacking political motives, had strong support from local residents and grassroots movements in the country. According to [[NACLA]], incoming President Funes later rejected a company's application for a further permit based on the risk of cyanide contamination on one of the country's main rivers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nacla.org/blog/2012/6/8/pacific-rim-ruling-threatens-el-salvador%25E2%2580%2599s-national-sovereignty|title=Pacific Rim Ruling Threatens El Salvador's National Sovereignty|website=NACLA}}</ref>

As with other former colonies, El Salvador was considered a mono-export economy (an economy that depended heavily on one type of export) for many years. During colonial times, El Salvador was a thriving exporter of [[Indigo dye|indigo]], but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, the newly created modern state turned to [[coffee]] as the main export.

[[File:Fdpt18102006bmcha43c.jpg|thumb|[[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] is an important economic center of El Salvador and home to the "Carnival of San Miguel", one of the biggest festivals of entertainment and food in Central America.<ref name="Herrera-Sobek2012">{{cite book|author=Maria Herrera-Sobek|title=Celebrating Latino Folklore|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lY-tY62V1FIC&pg=PA459|date=31 July 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34340-7|page=459}}</ref>]]
The government has sought to improve the collection of its current [[revenue]]s, with a focus on indirect taxes. A 10% [[value-added tax]] (IVA in Spanish), implemented in September 1992, was raised to 13% in July 1995.

[[Inflation]] has been steady and among the lowest in the region. Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3%, with recent years increasing to nearly 5%. As a result of the free trade agreements, from 2000 to 2006, total exports have grown 19% from $2.94 billion to $3.51 billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95 billion to $7.63 billion. This has resulted in a 102% increase in the trade deficit, from $2.01 billion to $4.12 billion.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade Balance, Annual and Monthly Accumulated|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_balanzacom.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014112428/http://bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_balanzacom.html|archivedate=October 14, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:El Chorreron, San Fernando, El Salvador.jpg|thumb|upright|El Chorreron, El Salvador; tourism is the fastest-growing sector of the Salvadoran economy.]]

El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment, and has embarked on a wave of privatization extending to telecommunications, electricity distribution, banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the civil war, through investments in education, public services, enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing.

===Remittances from abroad===
El Salvador leads the region in remittances per capita, with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income; about a third of all households receive these financial inflows. Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family members in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign [[income]] and offset the substantial [[trade deficit]] of $4.12 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade, and reached an all-time high of $3.32 billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).<ref>{{cite web|title=Family Remittances|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107112652/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html|archivedate=November 7, 2007}}</ref> approximately 16.2% of [[gross domestic product]](GDP).

Remittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador. In 2005, the number of people living in [[extreme poverty]] in El Salvador was 20%,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.redsolidaria.gob.sv/content/view/677/46/1/1/|title=Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio|accessdate=2007-05-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527082755/http://www.redsolidaria.gob.sv/content/view/677/46/1/1/|archivedate=May 27, 2007|deadurl=yes|language=Spanish}}
<!-- see http://www.mh.gob.sv/portal/page/portal/PCC/Boletin2010/Bolet%EDn_Presupuestario_Octubre-Diciembre_20101.pdf for an update-->
</ref> according to a United Nations Development Program report. Without remittances, the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased.

Money from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. With much higher wages, many Salvadorans abroad can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans, and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Money Earned in U.S. Pushes Up Prices in El Salvador|work=The Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}</ref>

===Free trade agreements===
[[File:Torre futura.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Torre Futura]] at [[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]

In 2006, El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the [[Multi-Fiber Agreement]] in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives.

There are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) — negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] — with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].

===Official corruption and foreign investment===
In an analysis of ARENA's electoral defeat in 2009, the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador pointed to official corruption under the Saca administration as a significant reason for public rejection of continued ARENA government. According to a secret diplomatic cable made public by WikiLeaks, "While the Salvadoran public may be inured to self-serving behavior by politicians, many in ARENA believe that the brazen manner in which Saca and his people are widely perceived to have used their positions for personal enrichment went beyond the pale. ARENA deputy Roberto d'Aubuisson, son of ARENA founder [[Roberto d'Aubuisson]], told [a U.S. diplomat] that Saca 'deliberately ignored' his Public Works Minister's government contract kickbacks scheme, even after the case was revealed in the press. Furthermore, considerable evidence exists, including from U.S. business sources, that the Saca administration pushed laws and selectively enforced regulations with the specific intent to benefit Saca family business interests."<ref>U.S. Embassy San Salvador, "Reorganizing ARENA: The party's future after Avila's defeat," secret diplomatic cable, 6 October 2009, released by WikiLeaks, [http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR947 ID No. 09SANSALVADOR947] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603032809/http://cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR947 |date=2012-06-03 }}.</ref>

Subsequent policies under Funes administrations improved El Salvador to foreign investment, and the World Bank in 2014 rated El Salvador 109, a little better than Belize (118) and Nicaragua (119) in the World Bank's annual "[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing business]]" index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206025936/http://www.doingbusiness.org/rankings |archivedate=2015-02-06 |df= }} Annual index, Doing Business 2014, World Bank.</ref>

As per Santander Trade, a Spanish think tank in foreign investment, "Foreign investment into El Salvador has been steadily growing during the last few years. In 2013, the influx of FDI increased. Nevertheless, El Salvador receives less FDI than other countries of Central America. The government has made little progress in terms of improving the business climate. In addition to this, the limited size of its domestic market, weak infrastructures and institutions, as well as the high level of criminality have been real obstacles to investors. However, El Salvador is the second most "business friendly" country in South America in terms of business taxation. It also has a young and skilled labor force and a strategic geographical position. The country's membership in the DR-CAFTA, as well as its reinforced integration to the C4 countries (producers of cotton) should lead to an increase of FDI."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.santandertrade.com/establish-overseas/el-salvador/investing-3|title=Foreign investment in El Salvador - Santandertrade.com|website=en.santandertrade.com}}</ref>

Foreign companies have lately resorted to arbitration in international trade tribunals in total disagreement with Salvadoran government policies. In 2008, El Salvador sought international arbitration against Italy's Enel Green Power, on behalf of Salvadoran state-owned electric companies for a geothermal project Enel had invested in. Four years later, Enel indicated it would seek arbitration against El Salvador, blaming the government for technical problems that prevent it from completing its investment.<ref>[http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=47861&idArt=6919711 "CEL a punto de ir a otro arbitraje,"] El Diario de Hoy (2012-05-21).</ref> The government came to its defense claiming that Art 109 of the constitution does not allow any government (regardless of the party they belong), to privatize the resources of the national soil (in this case geothermic energy).

On the other hand, a 2008 report by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] [http://unctad.org/en/docs/diaepcb200920_en.pdf] indicates that one third of the generation of electricity in El Salvador was publicly owned while two thirds was in American hands and other foreign ownership. It is only natural for a small, under-developed country like El Salvador to subsidize some of the resources for the vast majority of its poor population.

[[File:Surfing in El Salvador by L. E. MacDonald.png|thumb|El Salvador has surf tourism due to large waves from the Pacific Ocean.]]
Most North American and European tourists seek out El Salvador's beaches and nightlife. Besides these two attractions, El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different from those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographic size and urbanization there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological sites open to the public. [[Surfing]] is a natural tourism sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular.

Surfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east end of El Salvador, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. The use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4 to 6 hours from most cities in the United States are factors that attract American tourists. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.

According to the El Salvadoran newspaper ''[[El Diario De Hoy]]'', the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], Ruta Las Flores, [[Suchitoto]], Playa Las Flores in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], La Palma, [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223005240/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&idArt=1482342 |archivedate=2008-02-23 |title=Los 10 destinos turísticos más apetecidos |author=Milady Cruz |date=2007-06-24|publisher=elsalvador.com |accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in El Salvador}}
The level of access to [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]] has been increased significantly. A 2015 conducted study by the University of North Carolina called El Salvador the country that has achieved the greatest progress in the world in terms of increased access to water supply and sanitation and the reduction of inequity in access between urban and rural areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=The WASH Performance Index Report|url=http://waterinstitute.unc.edu/wash-performance-index-report/|editor1=The Water Institute |editor2=University of North Carolina }}</ref> However, water resources are seriously polluted and a large part of the wastewater discharged into the environment without any [[wastewater treatment|treatment]]. Institutionally a single public institution is both de facto in charge of setting sector policy and of being the main service provider. Attempts at reforming and modernizing the sector through new laws have not borne fruit over the past 20 years.

The capital city of San Salvador has a population of about 2.1 million people. An estimated 42% of El Salvador's population live in rural areas. [[Urbanization]] has expanded at a phenomenal rate in El Salvador since the 1960s, with millions moving to the cities and creating associated problems for urban planning and services.

===Ethnic groups===

[[File:Potada.JPG|thumb|upright|Salvadoran model [[Irma Dimas]] was crowned Miss El Salvador in 2005. She made headlines recently for her entry into Salvadoran politics.]]
El Salvador's population is composed of [[Mestizo]]s, whites, and indigenous peoples. Eighty-six percent of Salvadorans are of mestizo ancestry, having mixed indigenous and European ancestry.<ref name=cia>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/es.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook – El Salvador |accessdate=2013-10-12 |publisher=CIA }}</ref> In the mestizo population, Salvadorans who are racially European, especially Mediterranean, as well as [[Afro-Salvadoran]], and the indigenous people in El Salvador who do not speak indigenous languages or have an indigenous culture, all identify themselves as being culturally mestizo.<ref>[http://www.travisa.com/Elsalvador/elsalvadorportal.htm EL SALVADOR Visa Application – Tourist Visas, Business Visas, Expedited Visas – El Salvador Page<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201052106/http://travisa.com/Elsalvador/elsalvadorportal.htm |date=2010-12-01 }}</ref>

12.7% of Salvadorans are [[White Latin American|white]]. A majority of [[Central Europe]]an immigrants in El Salvador arrived during World War II as refugees from the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Switzerland]]. There are also a small community of [[Jews]], [[Palestinian Christians]], and Arab [[Muslims]] (in particular [[Palestinian Salvadoran|Palestinians]]).

===Languages===
Spanish is the official language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants. Some indigenous people speak their native tongues (such as [[Pipil language|Nawat]] and [[Mayan languages|Maya]]), but indigenous Salvadorans who do not identify as mestizo constitute only 1% of the country's population. However, all of them can speak Spanish. [[Q'eqchi' language|Q'eqchi']] is spoken by immigrants of [[Guatemala]]n and [[Belize]]an indigenous people living in El Salvador. There have also been recent large migrations of [[Hondurans]] and [[Nicaraguans]] into the country.<ref>[[Ethnologue:kek|Ethnologue report for language code:kek]]. Ethnologue.com. Retrieved 2012-07-28.</ref>

The local Spanish [[vernacular]] is called ''Caliche''. Salvadorans use [[voseo]], which is also used in [[Argentina]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Uruguay]]. This refers to the use of "vos" as the second person pronoun, instead of "tú". "Caliche" is considered informal, and a few people choose not to use it. [[Pipil language|Nawat]] is an indigenous language that has survived, though it is only used by small communities of some elderly Salvadorans in western El Salvador.

The public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources. Class sizes in public schools can be as large as 50 children per classroom. Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools, which are regarded as being better-quality than public schools. Most private schools follow American, European or other advanced systems. Lower-income families are forced to rely on public education.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Education in El Salvador is free through high school. After nine years of basic education (elementary–middle school), students have the option of a two-year high school or a three-year high school. A two-year high school prepares the student for transfer to a university. A three-year high school allows the student to graduate and enter the workforce in a vocational career, or to transfer to a university to further their education in their chosen field.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~hakuta/www/archives/syllabi/E_CLAD/sfusd_cult_03/nancy/new/educ.html|title=What's Education Like in El Salvador|last=|first=|date=|website=web.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-01-29}}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of El Salvador}}
[[File:Monumento al Salvador del Mundo 2.jpg|thumb|right|The iconic statue of Christ on the globe sphere of planet earth is part of the [[Monumento al Divino Salvador del Mundo]] (Monument to the Divine Savior of the world) on Plaza El Salvador del Mundo (The Savior of the World Plaza), a landmark located in the country's capital, San Salvador.
]]
[[Mestizo]] culture dominates the country, heavy in both Native American Indigenous and European Spanish influences. A new composite population was formed as a result of intermarrying between the native [[Mesoamerican]] population of Cuzcatlan with the European settlers. The [[Catholic Church]] plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture. [[Archbishop Óscar Romero]] is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War.<ref name=Eaton>Eaton, Helen-May (1991). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/116/ The impact of the Archbishop Óscar Romero's alliance with the struggle for liberation of the Salvadoran people: A discussion of church-state relations (El Salvador)]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University</ref> Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the [[Jesuit]] priests and professors [[Ignacio Ellacuría]], [[Ignacio Martín-Baró]], and [[Segundo Montes]], who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war.

Painting, ceramics and textiles are the principal manual artistic mediums. Writers [[Francisco Gavidia]] (1863–1955), [[Salarrué]] (Salvador Salazar Arrué) (1899–1975), [[Claudia Lars]], [[Alfredo Espino]], [[Pedro Geoffroy Rivas]], [[Manlio Argueta]], [[José Roberto Cea]], and poet [[Roque Dalton]] are among the most important writers from El Salvador. Notable 20th-century personages include the late filmmaker Baltasar Polio, female film director [[Patricia Chica]], artist [[Fernando Llort]], and [[caricaturist]] [[Toño Salazar]].

Amongst the more renowned representatives of the graphic arts are the painters [[Augusto Crespin]], [[Noe Canjura]], [[Carlos Cañas]], [[Giovanni Gil]], Julia Díaz, Mauricio Mejia, Maria Elena Palomo de Mejia, [[Camilo Minero]], Ricardo Carbonell, Roberto Huezo, Miguel Angel Cerna, (the painter and writer better known as MACLo), Esael Araujo, and many others.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Salvadoran cuisine}}
[[File:Plain pupusas revueltas.jpg|thumb|''Pupusas'', the national and most famous dish of El Salvador.]]
[[File:Sopa de pata.jpg|thumb|''[[Sopa de pata]]'']]
One of El Salvador's notable dishes is the ''[[pupusa]]''. ''Pupusas'' are handmade corn tortillas (made of ''[[masa|masa de maíz]]'' or ''masa de arroz'', a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as ''[[quesillo]]'', similar to mozzarella), ''[[chicharrón]]'', or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is ''queso con loroco'' (cheese combined with ''[[loroco]]'', a vine flower bud native to Central America).<ref name="Elsalvador.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Pobladores prehispánicos inventaron las pupusas|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date=2003-10-31|accessdate=2010-05-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503202216/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|archivedate=2011-05-03|df=}}</ref>

''Pupusas revueltas'' are ''pupusas'' filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer ''pupusas'' stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name ''pupusa'' comes from the Pipil-Nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The precise origins of the ''pupusa'' are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.<ref name="Elsalvador.com"/>

Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are ''yuca frita'' and ''panes con pollo''. ''Yuca frita'' is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with ''pescaditas'' (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. ''Pan con pollo/pavo'' (bread with chicken/turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]] or [[chicken]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The bird is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and handpulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[tomato]] and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].

One of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.

[[Alguashte]], a condiment made from dried, ground [[pepitas]], is commonly incorporated into savoury and sweet Salvadoran dishes.

"''Maria Luisa''" is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

A popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is ''[[Horchata]]'', a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. ''Horchata'' is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. ''Horchata'' is drank year-round, and can be drank at any time of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of ''pupusas'' or fried yuca. ''Horchata'' from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican ''horchata'', which is rice-based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador – traditional, history, ''People'', clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|publisher=everyculture.com}}</ref>

Other popular drinks in El Salvador include ''Ensalada'',  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice, and ''Kolachampan'', a sugar cane-flavored carbonated beverage.

One of the most popular desserts is the cake ''Pastel de tres leches'' (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk: evaporated milk, condensed milk, and cream.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of El Salvador}}
Salvadoran music is a mixture of indigenous [[Lenca]], [[Maya peoples|Maya]], [[Cacaopera people|Cacaopera]], [[Pipils|Pipil]] and Spanish influences. Music includes religious songs (mostly used to celebrate [[Christmas]] and other [[Religious holiday|holidays]], especially [[feast day]]s of the [[saint]]s). Satirical and rural lyrical themes are common. [[Cuba]]n, [[Colombia]]n, and Mexican music has infiltrated the country, especially ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'' and ''[[Cumbia music|cumbia]]''. Popular music in El Salvador uses ''marimba'', ''tehpe'ch'', [[flute]]s, [[drum]]s, [[scraper (instrument)|scraper]]s and [[gourd]]s, as well as more recently imported [[guitar]]s and other instruments. El Salvador's well known folk dance is known as ''Xuc'' which originated in [[Cojutepeque]], [[Cuscatlán Department|Cuscatlan]]. Other musical repertoire consists of danza, pasillo, marcha and canciones.

===Sport===
[[File:Estadio cuscatlan.jpg|thumb|The [[Estadio Cuscatlán]] in San Salvador is the largest stadium in Central America]]
{{main|Sport in El Salvador}}
[[association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in  El Salvador. The [[El Salvador national football team]] qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]]. Their qualification for the 1970 tournament was marred by the [[Football War]], a war against [[Honduras]], whose team El Salvador's had defeated.

The national football team play at the [[Estadio Cuscatlán]] in San Salvador. It opened in 1976 and seats 53,400, making it the largest stadium in Central America and the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite web|title=Estadio Cuscatlán|url=http://www.radioguanaca.net/liga-mayor/playground/1-futbol/7-estadio-cuscatlan|publisher=Radio Guanaca|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref>

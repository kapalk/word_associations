It is bordered by the [[Netherlands]] to the north, [[Germany]] to the east, [[Luxembourg]] to the southeast, [[France]] to the southwest, and the [[North Sea]] to the northwest. It covers an area of {{convert|30688|km2|sqmi}} and has a population of more than 11.4 million. The capital and largest city is [[Brussels]]; other major cities are [[Antwerp]], [[Ghent]], [[Charleroi]] and [[Liège]].

The [[sovereign state]] is a [[Federation|federal]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with a [[parliamentary system]]. Its institutional organisation is complex and is structured on both regional and linguistic grounds. It is divided into three highly [[autonomous]] [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|regions]]:<ref>Robert Pateman, Mark Elliott (2006). ''Belgium''. Benchmark Books. p. 27.</ref> [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] in the north, [[Wallonia]] in the south, and the [[Brussels|Brussels-Capital Region]]. Brussels is the smallest and most densely populated region, as well as the richest region in terms of [[GDP per capita]].

Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups or ''[[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|Communities]]'': the Dutch-speaking, mostly [[Flemish Community]], which constitutes about 59 percent of the population, and the [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking Community]], which comprises about 40 percent of all Belgians. A small [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]], numbering around one percent, exists in the [[East Cantons]].

Historically, Belgium was part of an area known as the [[Low Countries]], a somewhat larger region than the current [[Benelux]] group of states that also included parts of northern France and western Germany. Its name is derived from the Latin word ''Belgica'', after the [[Roman province]] of [[Gallia Belgica]]. From the end of the [[Middle Ages]] until the 17th century, the area of Belgium was a prosperous and cosmopolitan centre of commerce and culture. Between the 16th and early 19th centuries, Belgium served as the battleground between many European powers, earning the moniker the "Battlefield of Europe",<ref name=Hass>{{cite book|title=Rezension zu (Review of) Cook, Bernard: Belgium.

The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] (''Belgica Foederata'' in [[Latin]], the "Federated Netherlands") and the [[Southern Netherlands]] (''Belgica Regia'', the "Royal Netherlands"). The latter were ruled successively by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] ([[Spanish Netherlands]]) and the [[History of Austria#Charles VI and Maria Theresa (1711–1780)|Austrian]] [[Habsburg]]s ([[Austrian Netherlands]]) and comprised most of modern Belgium. This was the theatre of most [[Franco-Spanish War (1635)|Franco-Spanish]] and [[War of the Austrian Succession|Franco-Austrian wars]]<!--disambiguation page intended: "most" wars of that list--> during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Following the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries—including territories that were never nominally under Habsburg rule, such as the Prince-Bishopric of Liège—were annexed by the [[French First Republic]], ending Austrian rule in the region. The reunification of the Low Countries as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] occurred at the dissolution of the [[First French Empire]] in 1815, after the defeat of Napoleon.

[[German invasion of Belgium|Germany invaded Belgium in August 1914]] as part of the [[Schlieffen Plan]] to attack [[France]], and much of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] fighting of [[World War I]] occurred in western parts of the country. The opening months of the war were known as the [[Rape of Belgium]] due to German excesses. Belgium assumed control of the [[German colonies]] of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern-day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]) during the war, and in 1924 the [[League of Nations]] mandated them to Belgium. In the aftermath of the First World War, Belgium annexed the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] in 1925, thereby causing the presence of a German-speaking minority.

However, due to consistent efforts by the various levels of government in Belgium, the state of the environment in Belgium is gradually improving. This led to Belgium being ranked as [[Environmental Performance Index|one of the top 10 countries]] (9 out of 132) in terms of environmental protection trends, and to Belgium being ranked in 2012 as the 24th country out of 132 for environmental protection. Belgium moreover has one of Europe's highest waste recycling rates. In particular, the Flemish region of Belgium has the highest waste diversion rate in Europe. Almost 75 percent of the residential waste produced there is reused, recycled, or composted.

On 22 July 2014, King Philippe nominated [[Charles Michel]] (MR) and [[Kris Peeters]] (CD&V) to [[2014 Belgian government formation|lead the formation of a new federal cabinet]] composed of the Flemish parties N-VA, CD&V, Open Vld and the French-speaking MR, which resulted in the [[Michel I Government|Michel Government]].

Following a usage which can be traced back to the Burgundian and Habsburg courts,<ref>{{cite book|title=Zweisprachigkeit in den Benelux-ländern|language=German|author=Kramer, Johannes|quote=Zur prestige Sprache wurde in den Spanischen Niederlanden ganz eindeutig das Französische.

# The [[Belgian federal government|federal government]], based in Brussels.
# The three language communities:
#* the [[Flemish Community]] (Dutch-speaking);
#* the [[French Community of Belgium|French Community]] (French-speaking);
#* the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium|German-speaking Community]].
# The three regions:
#* the [[Flemish Region]], subdivided into five [[provinces of Belgium|provinces]];
#* the [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]], subdivided into five provinces;
#* the [[Brussels-Capital Region]].

The [[Language legislation in Belgium|constitutional language areas]] determine the official languages in their municipalities, as well as the geographical limits of the empowered institutions for specific matters.<ref name="Fitzmaurice1996-p121">[[#Fitzmaurice|Fitzmaurice (1996)]], p. 121</ref> Although this would allow for seven parliaments and governments, when the Communities and Regions were created in 1980, Flemish politicians decided to merge both.<ref name="Fitzmaurice1996-p122">[[#Fitzmaurice|Fitzmaurice (1996)]], p. 122.</ref> Thus the Flemings just have one single institutional body of parliament and government is empowered for all except federal and specific municipal matters.{{efn-ua|The Constitution set out seven institutions each of which can have a parliament, government and administration. In fact, there are only six such bodies because the Flemish Region merged into the Flemish Community. This single Flemish body thus exercises powers about Community matters in the bilingual area of Brussels-Capital and in the Dutch language area, while about Regional matters only in Flanders.}}

The overlapping boundaries of the Regions and Communities have created two notable peculiarities: the territory of the Brussels-Capital Region (which came into existence nearly a decade after the other regions) is included in both the Flemish and French Communities, and the territory of the German-speaking Community lies wholly within the Walloon Region. Conflicts about jurisdiction between the bodies are resolved by the [[Constitutional Court of Belgium]]. The structure is intended as a compromise to allow different cultures to live together peacefully.<ref name="Fitzmaurice" />

===Locus of policy jurisdiction===
The Federal State's authority includes justice, defence, federal police, social security, nuclear energy, monetary policy and public debt, and other aspects of public finances. State-owned companies include the [[Belgian Post Group]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|Belgian Railways]]. The Federal Government is responsible for the obligations of Belgium and its federalized institutions towards the European Union and NATO. It controls substantial parts of public health, home affairs and foreign affairs.<ref name=fedgov1>{{cite web|title=The Federal Government's Powers|work=.be Portal|publisher=Belgian Federal Government|url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/federal_authorities/competence_federal_government/|accessdate=4 February 2011|date=2010-10-03}}</ref> The budget—without the debt—controlled by the federal government amounts to about 50% of the national fiscal income. The federal government employs around 12% of the civil servants.<ref>{{cite book|quote=In 2002, 58.92% of the fiscal income was going to the budget of the federal government, but more than one-third was used to pay the interests of the public debt. Without including this post, the share of the federal government budget would be only 48.40% of the fiscal income. There are 87.8% of the civil servants who are working for the Regions or the Communities and 12.2% for the Federal State.|author=Lagasse, Charles-Etienne|title=Les nouvelles institutions politiques de la Belgique et de l'Europe|publisher=Erasme|location=Namur|year=2003|isbn=978-2-87127-783-5|page=289}}</ref>

Communities exercise their authority only within linguistically determined geographical boundaries, originally oriented towards the individuals of a Community's language: culture (including audiovisual media), education and the use of the relevant language. Extensions to personal matters less directly connected with language comprise health policy (curative and preventive medicine) and assistance to individuals (protection of youth, social welfare, aid to families, [[immigrant]] assistance services, and so on.).<ref name=fedgov2>{{cite web|title=The Communities|work=.be Portal|publisher=Belgian Federal Government|url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/communities/|accessdate=26 June 2011|date=2010-10-03}}</ref>

Regions have authority in fields that can be broadly associated with their territory. These include economy, employment, agriculture, water policy, housing, public works, energy, transport, the environment, town and country planning, nature conservation, credit and foreign trade. They supervise the provinces, municipalities and intercommunal utility companies.<ref name=fedgov3>{{cite web|title=The Regions|work=.be Portal |publisher=Belgian Federal Government|url=http://www.belgium.be/en/about_belgium/government/regions/|accessdate=26 June 2011|date=2010-10-03 }}</ref>

In several fields, the different levels each have their own say on specifics. With education, for instance, the autonomy of the Communities neither includes decisions about the compulsory aspect nor allows for setting minimum requirements for awarding qualifications, which remain federal matters.<ref name=fedgov1/> Each level of government can be involved in scientific research and international relations associated with its powers. The treaty-making power of the Regions' and Communities' Governments is the broadest of all the Federating units of all the Federations all over the world.<ref name=Lagasse1>{{cite web|url= http://www.kazanfed.ru/en/actions/konfer8/6/|title=Federalism in Russia, Canada and Belgium: experience of comparative research|language=French|quote=La Belgique constitue ainsi le seul exemple clair du transfert d'une partie de la compétence " affaires étrangères " à des entités fédérées.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Belgium}}

Because of its location at the crossroads of [[Western Europe]], Belgium has historically been the route of invading armies from its larger neighbours. With virtually defenceless borders, Belgium has traditionally sought to avoid domination by the more powerful nations which surround it through a policy of mediation. The Belgians have been strong advocates of [[European integration]]. Both the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] are headquartered in Belgium.

===Armed forces===
{{Main|Belgian Armed Forces}}

The Belgian Armed Forces have about 47,000 active troops. In 2010, Belgium's defence budget totaled €3.95&nbsp;billion (representing 1.12% of its GDP).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/DefenceData/Belgium?DDYear=2010 |title=Defence Data of Belgium in 2010 |publisher=[[European Defence Agency]] |accessdate=9 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924153002/http://www.eda.europa.eu/DefenceData/Belgium?DDYear=2010 |archivedate=24 September 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> They are organized into one unified structure which consists of four main components: [[Belgian Land Component|Land Component]], or the Army; [[Belgian Air Component|Air Component]], or the Air Force; [[Belgian Naval Component|Naval Component]], or the Navy; [[Belgian Medical Component|Medical Component]]. The operational commands of the four components are subordinate to the Staff Department for Operations and Training of the [[Ministry of Defence (Belgium)|Ministry of Defence]], which is headed by the [[ACOS Operations and Training|Assistant Chief of Staff Operations and Training]], and to the [[Chief of Defence (Belgium)|Chief of Defence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.be/def/index.asp |title=Defensie La Défense |accessdate=15 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614214307/http://www.mil.be/def/index.asp |archivedate=14 June 2011 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>

The effects of the [[Second World War]] made [[collective security]] a priority for [[Foreign relations of Belgium|Belgian foreign policy]]. In March 1948 Belgium signed the [[Treaty of Brussels]], and then joined [[NATO]] in 1948. However the integration of the armed forces into NATO did not begin until after the [[Korean War]].<ref>David Isby and Charles Kamps Jr, 'Armies of NATO's Central Front,' Jane's Publishing Company, 1985, p.59</ref> The Belgians, along with the Luxembourg government, sent a detachment of battalion strength to fight in Korea known as the [[Belgian United Nations Command]]. This mission was the first in a long line of UN missions which the Belgians supported. Currently, the Belgian Naval Component is working closely together with the [[Dutch Navy]] under the command of the [[Admiral Benelux]].

There is a large economic gap between [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]]. Wallonia was historically wealthy compared to Flanders, mostly due to its [[heavy industry|heavy industries]], but the decline of the steel industry post-World War II led to the region's rapid decline, whereas Flanders rose swiftly. Since then, Flanders has been prosperous, among the wealthiest regions in Europe, whereas Wallonia has been languishing. As of 2007, the unemployment rate of Wallonia is over double that of Flanders. The divide has played a key part in the tensions between the Flemish and Walloons in addition to the already-existing language divide. [[Flemish Movement|Pro-independence movements]] have gained high popularity in Flanders as a consequence.

In the early 2000s there were approximately 42,000 Jews in Belgium. The [[Jewish Community of Antwerp]] (numbering some 18,000) is one of the largest in Europe, and one of the last places in the world where [[Yiddish]] is the primary language of a large Jewish community (mirroring certain Orthodox and Hasidic communities in New York, New Jersey, and Israel). In addition most Jewish children in Antwerp receive a Jewish education.<ref>Ghiuzeli, Haim F. [http://www.bh.org.il/database-article.aspx?48207 The Jewish Community of Antwerp, Belgium]. Beit Hatfutsot, the Museum of the Jewish People</ref> There are several Jewish newspapers and more than 45 active synagogues (30 of which are in Antwerp) in the country.
A 2006 inquiry in Flanders, considered to be a more religious region than Wallonia, showed that 55% considered themselves religious and that 36% believed that God created the universe.<ref>Inquiry by 'Vepec', 'Vereniging voor Promotie en Communicatie' (Organization for Promotion and Communication), published in Knack magazine {{Nowrap|22 November}} 2006 p. 14 [The Dutch language term 'gelovig' is in the text translated as 'religious'. More precisely it is a very common word for believing in particular in any kind of God in a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] sense, or in some [[afterlife]]], or both.</ref> On the other hand, Wallonia has become one of Europe's most secular/least religious regions. Most of the French-speaking region's population does not consider religion an important part of their lives, and as much as 45% of the population identifies as irreligious. This is particularly the case in eastern Wallonia and areas along the French border.

The Belgians enjoy good health.

Death in Belgium is mainly due to heart and vascular disorders, [[neoplasm]]s, disorders of the respiratory system and unnatural causes of death (accidents, suicide).

[[Healthcare in Belgium]] is financed through both social security contributions and taxation. Health insurance is compulsory. Health care is delivered by a mixed public and private system of independent medical practitioners and public, university and semi-private hospitals.

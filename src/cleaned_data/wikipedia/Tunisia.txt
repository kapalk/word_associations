In ancient times, Tunisia was primarily inhabited by [[Berbers]]. Phoenician immigration began in the 12th century BC; these immigrants founded [[Carthage]]. A major mercantile power and a military rival of the [[Roman Republic]], Carthage was [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|defeated]] by the Romans in 146 BC. The Romans, who would occupy Tunisia for most of the next eight hundred years, introduced Christianity and left architectural legacies like the [[El Djem]] amphitheater. After several attempts starting in 647, the Muslims [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|conquered]] the whole of Tunisia by 697, followed by the [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1534 and 1574. The Ottomans held sway for over three hundred years. The [[French conquest of Tunisia|French colonization of Tunisia]] occurred in 1881. Tunisia gained independence with [[Habib Bourguiba]] and declared the Tunisian Republic in 1957.

The French derivative {{lang|fr|Tunisie}} was adopted in some European languages with slight modifications, introducing a distinctive name to designate the country. Other languages remained untouched, such as the Russian {{lang|ru|Туни́с}} ({{transl|ru|Tunís}}) and Spanish {{lang|es|Túnez}}.

Before Tunisia, the territory's name was [[Ifriqiya]] or [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], which gave the present-day name of the continent Africa.

[[File:Dougga Thugga-130240.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Dougga|Dougga's]] [[World Heritage Site]].]]
Farming methods reached the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] from the [[Fertile Crescent]] region about 5000 BC, and spread to the [[Maghreb]] by about 4000 BC. Agricultural communities in the humid coastal plains of central Tunisia then were ancestors of today's [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes.

It was believed in ancient times that Africa was originally populated by [[Gaetuli]]ans and Libyans, both nomadic peoples.  According to the Roman historian [[Sallust]], the demigod Hercules died in Spain and his polyglot eastern army was left to settle the land, with some [[Human migration|migrating]] to Africa. Persians went to the West and intermarried with the Gaetulians and became the Numidians. The Medes settled and were known as Mauri, later Moors.<ref>Banjamin Isaac, The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity, Princeton University Press, 2013 p.147</ref>
[[File:Carthage Holdings.png|alt=|thumb|[[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]]-held territory before the first First Punic War]]
The Numidians and Moors belonged to the race from which the Berbers are descended. The translated meaning of Numidian is Nomad and indeed the people were semi-nomadic until the reign of [[Masinissa]] of the Massyli tribe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hannibalbarca.webspace.virginmedia.com/carthage-numidians.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331154523/http://hannibalbarca.webspace.virginmedia.com/carthage-numidians.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 March 2012 |title=Carthage and the Numidians |publisher=Hannibalbarca.webspace.virginmedia.com |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/tunisia/dougga19.htm |title=LookLex / Tunisia / Dougga / Numidian Wall |publisher=Looklex.com |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://fanaticus.org/DBA/armies/II40-57.html |title=Numidians (DBA II/40) and Moors (DBA II/57) |publisher=Fanaticus.org |date=12 December 2001 |accessdate=28 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024947/http://www.fanaticus.org/DBA/armies/II40-57.html |archivedate=27 September 2011  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://looklex.com/tunisia/chemtou02.htm |title=LookLex / Tunisia / Chemtou / Numidian Altar & Roman Temple |publisher=Looklex.com |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/422426/Numidia |title=Numidia (ancient region, Africa) |publisher=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=28 October 2011}}</ref>

At the beginning of recorded history, Tunisia was inhabited by [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes. Its coast was settled by [[Phoenicia]]ns starting as early as the 12th century BC ([[Bizerte]], [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]]). The city of [[Carthage]] was founded in the 9th century BC by Phoenicians. Legend says that [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] from Tyre, now in modern-day Lebanon, founded the city in 814 BC, as retold by the [[Greeks|Greek]] writer Timaeus of Tauromenium. The settlers of Carthage brought their culture and religion from Phoenicia, now present-day [[Lebanon]] and adjacent areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Administration/Committees/documents/TheCityofCarthage.pdf |title=The City of Carthage: From Dido to the Arab Conquest |date= |accessdate=8 January 2013}}</ref>

After the series of wars with Greek city-states of Sicily in the 5th century BC, Carthage rose to power and eventually became the dominant civilization in the Western [[Mediterranean]]. The people of Carthage worshipped a pantheon of Middle Eastern gods including [[Baal]] and [[Tanit]]. Tanit's symbol, a simple female figure with extended arms and long dress, is a popular icon found in ancient sites. The founders of Carthage also established a [[Tophet]], which was altered in Roman times.

A Carthaginian invasion of Italy led by [[Hannibal]] during the [[Second Punic War]], one of a series of wars with [[Roman Republic|Rome]], nearly crippled the rise of Roman power. From the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 202 BC, Carthage functioned as a client state of the Roman Republic for another 50 years.<ref>[http://www.livius.org/sources/content/appian/appian-the-punic-wars/ Appian, The Punic Wars]. livius.org</ref>

Following the [[Battle of Carthage (c. 149 BC)|Battle of Carthage]] which began in 149 BC during the [[Third Punic War]], Carthage was conquered by Rome in 146 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/tunisia/history|title=History of Tunisia – Lonely Planet Travel Information|website=lonelyplanet.com|access-date=7 July 2017}}</ref> Following its conquest, the Romans renamed Carthage to [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]], incorporating it as a province.

[[File:Archaeological Site of Carthage-130238.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Carthage]]]]

During the Roman period, the area of what is now Tunisia enjoyed a huge development. The economy, mainly during the Empire, boomed: the prosperity of the area depended on agriculture. Called the ''Granary of the Empire'', the area of actual Tunisia and coastal [[Tripolitania]], according to one estimate, produced one million tons of cereals each year, one-quarter of which was exported to the Empire. Additional crops included beans, figs, grapes, and other fruits.

By the 2nd century, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item. In addition to the cultivations and the capture and transporting of exotic wild animals from the western mountains, the principal production and exports included the textiles, marble, wine, timber, livestock, pottery such as [[African Red Slip]], and wool.
[[File:Amphitheatre El Jem(js)1.jpg|thumb|The Roman amphitheater in [[El Djem]], built during the first half of the 3rd century AD]]

There was even a huge production of mosaics and ceramics, exported mainly to Italy, in the central area of [[El Djem]] (where there was the second biggest amphitheater in the Roman Empire).

Berber bishop [[Donatus Magnus]] was the founder of a Christian group known as the [[Donatist]]s.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/169009/Donatist | title = Donatist | encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> During the 5th and 6th centuries (from 430 to 533 AD), the Germanic [[Vandals]] invaded and ruled over a kingdom in Northwest Africa that included present-day Tripoli. The region was easily reconquered in 533–534 AD, during the rule of Emperor [[Justinian I]],  by the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Romans]] led by General [[Belisarius]].<ref>Bury, John Bagnell (1958) ''History of the Later Roman Empire from the Death of Theodosius I. to the Death of Justinian'', Part 2, Courier Corporation. pp.124–148</ref>

Tunis was taken in 695, re-taken by the Byzantine Eastern Romans in 697, but lost finally in 698. The transition from a Latin-speaking Christian Berber society to a Muslim and mostly Arabic-speaking society took over 400 years (the equivalent process in Egypt and the Fertile Crescent took 600 years) and resulted in the final disappearance of Christianity and Latin in the 12th or 13th centuries. The majority of the population were not Muslim until quite late in the 9th century; a vast majority were during the 10th. Also, some Tunisian Christians emigrated; some richer members of society did so after the conquest in 698 and others were welcomed by Norman rulers to Sicily or Italy in the 11th and 12th centuries – the logical destination because of the 1200 year close connection between the two regions.<ref>Jonathan Conant (2012) ''Staying Roman, Conquest and Identity in Africa and the Mediterranean, 439–700''.

The main Tunisian cities were conquered by the [[Normans]] of [[Sicily]] under the [[Kingdom of Africa]] in the 12th century, but following the conquest of Tunisia in 1159–1160 by the [[Almohads]] the Normans were evacuated to Sicily. Communities of Tunisian Christians would still exist in Tunisia up to the 14th century. The Almohads initially ruled over Tunisia through a governor, usually a near relative of the Caliph. Despite the prestige of the new masters, the country was still unruly, with continuous rioting and fighting between the townsfolk and wandering Arabs and Turks, the latter being subjects of the Muslim Armenian adventurer Karakush. Also, Tunisia was occupied by [[Ayyubids]] between 1182 and 1183 and again between 1184 and 1187.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.3989/alqantara.2013.010|title=Saladin and the Ayyubid Campaigns in the Maghrib|journal=Al-Qanṭara|volume=34|issue=2|pages=267–295|year=2013|last1=Baadj|first1=Amar}}</ref>

The greatest threat to Almohad rule in Tunisia was the [[Banu Ghaniya]], relatives of the [[Almoravids]], who from their base in [[Mallorca]] tried to restore Almoravid rule over the Maghreb. Around 1200 they succeeded in extending their rule over the whole of Tunisia until they were crushed by Almohad troops in 1207. After this success, the Almohads installed Walid Abu Hafs as the governor of Tunisia. Tunisia remained part of the Almohad state, until 1230 when the son of Abu Hafs declared himself independent. During the reign of the [[Hafsid dynasty]], fruitful commercial relationships were established with several Christian Mediterranean states.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bosworth, Clifford Edmund |title=The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKpz_2CkoWEC&pg=PA46 |year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-2137-8|page=46}}</ref> In the late 16th century the coast became a [[pirate]] stronghold (see: [[Barbary States]]).

===Ottoman Tunisia===
{{main|Ottoman Tunisia}}
In the last years of the [[Hafsid dynasty]], Spain seized many of the coastal cities, but these were recovered by the [[Ottoman Empire]].

[[File:Siège de Tunis 1535.JPG|thumb|left|[[Conquest of Tunis (1535)|Conquest of Tunis]] by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and liberation of Christian [[galley slave]]s in 1535]]
The [[Conquest of Tunis (1534)|first Ottoman conquest of Tunis]] took place in 1534 under the command of [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]], the younger brother of Oruç Reis, who was the [[Kapudan Pasha]] of the [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman Fleet]] during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]. However, it wasn't until the [[Conquest of Tunis (1574)|final Ottoman reconquest of Tunis from Spain]] in 1574 under Kapudan Pasha [[Uluç Ali Reis]] that the Ottomans permanently acquired the former [[History of medieval Tunisia#Hafsid dynasty of Tunis|Hafsid Tunisia]], retaining it until the [[French conquest of Tunisia]] in 1881.

Initially under Turkish rule from Algiers, soon the [[Ottoman Porte]] appointed directly for [[Tunis]] a governor called the [[Pasha]] supported by [[janissary]] forces. Before long, however, Tunisia became in effect an autonomous province, under the local [[Bey]]. Under its [[Turkish People|Turkish]] governors, the [[Beys]], Tunisia attained virtual independence. The [[Husainid Dynasty|Hussein dynasty]] of Beys, established in 1705, lasted until 1957.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bosworth, Clifford Edmund  |title=The New Islamic Dynasties: A Chronological and Genealogical Manual |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKpz_2CkoWEC&pg=PA55|year=2004 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-2137-8 |page=55}}</ref> This evolution of status was from time to time challenged without success by Algiers. During this era the governing councils controlling Tunisia remained largely composed of a foreign elite who continued to conduct state business in the [[Turkish language]].

Attacks on European shipping were made by [[Barbary corsairs|corsairs]], primarily from Algiers, but also from Tunis and [[Tripoli]], yet after a long period of declining raids the growing power of the European states finally forced its termination. Under the Ottoman Empire, the boundaries of Tunisia contracted; it lost territory to the west ([[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]]) and to the east ([[Tripoli]]).
[[File:Tunis Bab Souika 1899.jpg|thumb|[[Medina of Tunis|Medina quarter]] of Tunis]]

Great epidemics ravaged Tunisia in 1784–1785, 1796–1797 and 1818–1820.<ref>{{cite book|author=Panzac, Daniel |title=Barbary Corsairs: The End of a Legend, 1800–1820|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dyeFP5Hyc4C&pg=PA309|year=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-12594-0|page=309}}</ref>

In the 19th century, the rulers of Tunisia became aware of the ongoing efforts at political and social [[Tanzimat|reform in the Ottoman capital]]. The Bey of Tunis then, by his own lights but informed by the Turkish example, attempted to effect a modernizing reform of institutions and the economy.<ref name="Clancy-Smith1997">{{cite book|author=Clancy-Smith, Julia A. |title=Rebel and Saint: Muslim Notables, Populist Protest, Colonial Encounters (Algeria and Tunisia, 1800–1904) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApCtcGPHOxIC&pg=PA157 |year=1997 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-92037-8 |page=157}}</ref> Tunisian international debt grew unmanageable.

In 1869, Tunisia declared itself bankrupt and an international financial commission took control over its economy. In 1881, using the pretext of a Tunisian incursion into [[Algeria]], the French invaded with an army of about 36,000 and forced the Bey to agree to the terms of the 1881 [[Treaty of Bardo]] (Al Qasr as Sa'id).<ref>{{cite book|author=Gearon, Eamonn  |title=The Sahara: A Cultural History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TKh_21ZERH4C&pg=PA117 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-986195-8 |page=117}}</ref> With this treaty, Tunisia was officially made a [[French occupation of Tunisia|French protectorate]], over the objections of Italy. Under French colonization, European settlements in the country were actively encouraged; the number of [[French people|French]] colonists grew from 34,000 in 1906 to 144,000 in 1945. In 1910 there were 105,000 [[Italian Tunisians|Italians in Tunisia]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Ion Smeaton Munro|title=Through fascism to world power: a history of the revolution in Italy|year=1933|publisher=A.

During World War II, French Tunisia was ruled by the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government located in Metropolitan France. The antisemitic [[Vichy anti-Jewish legislation|Statute on Jews]] enacted by the Vichy was also implemented in Vichy Northwest Africa and overseas French territories. Thus, the persecution, and murder of the Jews from 1940 to 1943 was part of the [[The Holocaust|Shoah]] in France.

From November 1942 until May 1943, Vichy Tunisia was occupied by Nazi Germany. SS Commander [[Walter Rauff]] continued to implement the Final Solution there. From 1942–1943, Tunisia was the scene of the [[Tunisia Campaign]], a series of battles between the [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. The battle opened with initial success by the German and Italian forces, but the massive supply and numerical superiority of the Allies led to the [[Tunisian Campaign|Axis surrender]] on 13 May 1943.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gordon|last=Williamson|authorlink=Gordon Williamson (writer)|title=Afrikakorps 1941–43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1c44ccxC_sC&pg=PA24|year= 1991|publisher=Osprey |isbn=978-1-85532-130-4|page=24}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Palmer, Michael A. |title=The German Wars: A Concise History, 1859–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eHKE9NIwbMC&pg=PA199|year=2010|publisher=Zenith Imprint|isbn=978-0-7603-3780-6|page=199}}</ref>

{{main|Geography of Tunisia}}
[[File:Tunisia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification]] in Tunisia. The climate is Mediterranean towards the coast in the north, while most of the country is desert.]]
[[File:Téboursouk.jpg|thumb|left|View of the central Tunisian plateau at [[Téboursouk]]]]
Tunisia is situated on the [[Mediterranean]] coast of Northwest Africa, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Nile Delta]]. It is bordered by [[Algeria]] on the west and southwest and [[Libya]] on the south east. It lies between latitudes [[30th parallel north|30°]] and [[38th parallel north|38°N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian east|7°]] and [[12th meridian east|12°E]]. An abrupt southward turn of the Mediterranean coast in northern Tunisia gives the country two distinctive Mediterranean coasts, west-east in the north, and north-south in the east.

Though it is relatively small in size, Tunisia has great environmental diversity due to its north-south extent. Its east-west extent is limited. Differences in Tunisia, like the rest of the Maghreb, are largely north-south environmental differences defined by sharply decreasing rainfall southward from any point. The Dorsal, the eastern extension of the Atlas Mountains, runs across Tunisia in a northeasterly direction from the Algerian border in the west to the Cape Bon peninsula in the east. North of the Dorsal is the Tell, a region characterized by low, rolling hills and plains, again an extension of mountains to the west in Algeria. In the [[Khroumire|Khroumerie]], the northwestern corner of the Tunisian Tell, elevations reach {{convert|1050|m|ft}} and snow occurs in winter.

The [[Sahel, Tunisia|Sahel]], a broadening coastal plain along Tunisia's eastern Mediterranean coast, is among the world's premier areas of olive cultivation. Inland from the Sahel, between the Dorsal and a range of hills south of Gafsa, are the [[Steppes]]. Much of the southern region is [[semi-arid]] and [[desert]].

Tunisia has a coastline {{convert|1148|km|mi|}} long. In maritime terms, the country claims a contiguous zone of {{convert|24|nmi|1|lk=in}}, and a territorial sea of {{convert|12|nmi|1}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ewan W.|first=Anderson|title=International Boundaries: Geopolitical Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7-menNPxREC&pg=PA816|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-375-0|page=816}}</ref>

===Climate===
Tunisia's climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in the north, with mild rainy winters and hot, dry summers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209110533/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/country_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT000720 |archivedate= 9 February 2011 |title=Climate of Tunisia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The south of the country is desert.

A series of [[Tunisian salt lakes|salt lakes]], known as ''chotts'' or ''shatts'', lie in an east-west line at the northern edge of the Sahara, extending from the [[Gulf of Gabes]] into [[Algeria]]. The lowest point is [[Chott el Djerid]] at {{convert|17|m|ft}} below sea level and the highest is [[Jebel ech Chambi]] at {{convert|1544|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aldosari, Ali  |title=Middle East, western Asia, and northern Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j894miuOqc4C&pg=PA1270 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-7571-2|year=2006 |pages=1270–}}</ref>

Tunisia is a [[representative democracy]] and a [[republic]] with a [[President of Tunisia|president]] serving as [[head of state]], [[prime minister of Tunisia|prime minister]] as [[head of government]], a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[parliament]], and a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law court system]]. The [[Constitution of Tunisia]], adopted 26 January 2014, guarantees rights for women and states that the President's religion "shall be Islam". In October 2014 Tunisia held its first elections under the new constitution following the Arab Spring.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-29771109 |title=Tunisia holds first election under new constitution |date= 26 October 2014 |accessdate=26 October 2014|work=BBC News }}</ref>

The number of legalized [[political parties in Tunisia]] has grown considerably since the revolution. There are now over 100 legal parties, including several that existed under the former regime. During the rule of Ben Ali, only three functioned as independent opposition parties: the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Tunisia)|PDP]], [[Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties|FDTL]], and [[Ettajdid Movement|Tajdid]]. While some older parties are well-established and can draw on previous party structures, many of the 100-plus parties extant as of February 2012 are small.<ref name=cnsd>{{cite web|title=Tunisia (03/09/12)|url=https://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/tunisia/196390.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013143542/http://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/tunisia/196390.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 October 2012|publisher=US Department of State|date=9 March 2012}}</ref>

Tunisia is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP), which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer. On 23 November 2014 Tunisia held its first Presidential Election following the Arab Spring in 2011.<ref>{{cite news |date=23 November 2014 |title=Tunisia holds first post-revolution presidential poll |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-30165471 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=23 November 2014 }}</ref>

The Tunisian legal system is heavily influenced by [[French civil law]], while the Law of Personal Status is based on Islamic law.<ref name=ri-law>{{cite web|title=Tunisia|url=http://www.reunite.org/edit/files/Islamic%20Resource/Tunisia%20Text.pdf|publisher=Reunite International|accessdate=18 February 2013}}</ref> [[Sharia]] courts were abolished in 1956.<ref name=ri-law/>

A [[Code of Personal Status (Tunisia)|Code of Personal Status]] was adopted shortly after independence in 1956, which, among other things, gave women full legal status (allowing them to run and own businesses, have bank accounts, and seek passports under their own authority). The code outlawed the practices of polygamy and repudiation and a husband's right to unilaterally divorce his wife.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5439.htm |title=State Department page on Tunisia |publisher=State.gov |date=19 March 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> Further reforms in 1993 included a provision to allow Tunisian women to transmit citizenship even if they are married to a foreigner and living abroad.<ref>{{cite book|title=Major Trends Affecting Families: A Background Document|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZEip6FAiWYC&pg=PA190|accessdate=10 February 2013|year=2003|publisher=United Nations Publications|isbn=978-92-1-130252-3|page=190}}</ref> The Law of Personal Status is applied to all Tunisians regardless of their religion.<ref name=ri-law/> The Code of Personal Status remains one of the most progressive civil codes in North Africa and the Muslim world.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Tamanna | first = Nowrin | title = Personal status laws in Morocco and Tunisia: a comparative exploration of the possibilities for equality-enhancing reform in Bangladesh | journal = [[Feminist Legal Studies]] | volume = 16 | issue = 3 | pages = 323–343| doi = 10.1007/s10691-008-9099-9 | date = December 2008}}</ref>

===Human rights===
{{main|Human rights in Tunisia}}
After the revolution, a number of [[Salafi movement|Salafist]] groups emerged and in some occasions have violently repressed artistic expression that is viewed to be hostile to Islam.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/06/2012612101946542727.html | title=Scores arrested after Tunis art riots | publisher=AlJazeera | date= 12 June 2012}}</ref>

Since the revolution, some non-governmental organizations have reconstituted themselves and hundreds of new ones have emerged. For instance, the [[Tunisian Human Rights League]], the first human rights organization in Africa and the Arab world, operated under restrictions and state intrusion for over half of its existence, but is now free to operate. Some independent organizations, such as the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women, the Association of Tunisian Women for Research and Development, and the [[Bar Association]] also remain active.<ref name=cnsd/>

Tunisia has a diverse economy, ranging from agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and petroleum products, to [[Tourism in Tunisia|tourism]]. In 2008 it had a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of [[United States dollar|US$]]41 billion ([[Exchange rate|official exchange rates]]), or $82 billion (purchasing power parity).<ref name=CIA>{{cite web |title=Tunisia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ts.html |publisher=CIA World Factbook  }}</ref>

The agricultural sector accounts for 11.6% of the GDP, industry 25.7%, and services 62.8%. The industrial sector is mainly made up of clothing and footwear manufacturing, production of car parts, and electric machinery. Although Tunisia managed an average 5% growth over the last decade it continues to suffer from a high unemployment especially among youth.

The country maintains {{convert|19232|km|mi}} of roads,<ref name=CIA/> with three highways: the [[A1 motorway (Tunisia)|A1]] from Tunis to Sfax (works ongoing for Sfax-Libya), [[A3 motorway (Tunisia)|A3]] Tunis-Beja (works ongoing Beja – Boussalem, studies ongoing Boussalem – Algeria) and [[A4 motorway (Tunisia)|A4]] Tunis – Bizerte. There are 29 airports in Tunisia, with [[Tunis Carthage International Airport]] and [[Djerba–Zarzis International Airport]] being the most important ones. A new airport, [[Enfidha – Hammamet International Airport]] opened in 2011. The airport is located north of Sousse at Enfidha and is to mainly serve the resorts of Hamammet and Port El Kantaoui, together with inland cities such as Kairouan. Five airlines are headquartered in Tunisia: [[Tunisair]], [[Syphax airlines]], [[Karthago Airlines]], [[Nouvelair]], and [[Tunisair Express]].

Responsibility for the water supply systems in urban areas and large rural centres is assigned to the ''Sociéte Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux''
(SONEDE), a national water supply authority that is an autonomous 
public entity under the Ministry of Agriculture. Planning, design and 
supervision of small and medium water supplies in the remaining rural 
areas are the responsibility of the ''Direction Générale du Génie Rurale'' (DGGR).

In 1974, ONAS was established to manage the sanitation sector. Since 1993, ONAS has had the status of a main operator for 
protection of water environment and combating pollution.

The rate of non-revenue water is the lowest in the region at 21% in 2012.<ref name="SONEDE Chiffres">{{cite web|title = Chiffres clés|url = http://www.sonede.com.tn/index.php?id=43|publisher = SONEDE|accessdate = 27 December 2013}}</ref>

The first people known to history in what is now Tunisia were the [[Berber people|Berber]]s.

There was a continuing inflow of nomadic [[Banu Hilal|Arab tribes]] from [[Arabia]].<ref name="stearns"/>

After the [[Reconquista]] and expulsion of non-Christians and [[Morisco]]s from Spain, many Spanish [[Muslims]] and Jews also arrived.

Many Jews consider it a pilgrimage site, with celebrations taking place there once every year due to its age and the legend that the synagogue was built using stones from [[Solomon's temple]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Synagogues|author= Gruber, Samuel |publisher= Metro Books|date= 1 May 1999}}</ref> In fact, Tunisia along with [[Morocco]] has been said to be the Arab countries most accepting of their Jewish populations.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=David A. |url=http://www.aish.com/jw/me/87098057.html |title=Usurping History |publisher=Aish.com |date=13 March 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

The constitution declares [[Islam]] as the official [[state religion]] and requires the President to be [[Muslim]]. Aside from the president, Tunisians enjoy a significant degree of religious freedom, a right enshrined and protected in its constitution, which guarantees the freedom of thoughts, beliefs and to practice one's religion.<ref name="irfrtun">{{Cite book | last1 = Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor | contribution = Report on Tunisia | title = International Religious Freedom Report 2008 | publisher = US State Department | url = https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108494.htm | year = 2008}}</ref>

The country has a secular culture where religion is separated from not only political, but in public life. During the pre-revolution era there were at some point restrictions in the wearing of Islamic head scarves ([[hijab]]) in government offices and on public streets and public gatherings. The government believed the hijab is a "garment of foreign origin having a partisan connotation". There were reports that the Tunisian police harassed men with "Islamic" appearance (such as those with beards), detained them, and sometimes compelled men to shave their beards off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148847.htm |title=US Department of State |publisher=State.gov |date=17 November 2010 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}</ref>

In 2006, the former Tunisian president declared that he would "fight" the hijab, which he refers to as "ethnic clothing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3314887,00.html |title=Tunisia: War over hijab |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date=20 June 1995 |accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref> Mosques were restricted from holding communal prayers or classes. After the revolution however, a moderate Islamist government was elected leading to more freedom in the practice of religion. It has also made room for the rise of fundamentalist groups such as the [[Salafi]]sts, who call for a strict interpretation of Sharia law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/09/28/who_are_tunisia_s_salafis |title=Who Are Tunisia's Salafis? |publisher=Foreign Policy |date= |accessdate=1 July 2013}}</ref> The fall in favour of the moderate Islamist government of Ennahdha was partly due to that, modern Tunisian governments intelligence objectives are to suppress fundamentalist groups before they can pass to act.

Individual Tunisians are tolerant of religious freedom and generally do not inquire about a person's personal beliefs.<ref name="irfrtun"/> Those who violate the rules of work and eating during the Islamic month of Ramadan may be arrested and jailed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/tunisians-get-jail-terms-for-eating-during-ramadan/|title=4 Tunisians jailed for eating during Ramadan|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=5 June 2017}}</ref>

In 2017 a handful of men were arrested for eating in public during Ramadan; they were convicted of committing “a provocative act of public indecency” and sentenced to month-long jail sentences. The state in Tunisia has a role as a "guardian of religion" which was used to justify the arrests.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/ramadan-tunisia-protests-five-jailed-men-failing-observe-muslim-holiday-islam-a7787381.html|title=The country where people are forced to observe Ramadan|date=13 June 2017|work=The Independent|access-date=8 August 2017}}</ref>

While children generally acquire [[Tunisian Arabic]] at home, when they enter school at age 6, they are taught to read and write in [[Standard Arabic]]. From the age of 7, they are taught French while English is introduced at the age of 8.

The four years of secondary education are open to all holders of Diplôme de Fin d'Etudes de l'Enseignement de Base where the students focus on entering university level or join the workforce after completion. The Enseignement secondaire is divided into two stages: general academic and specialized. The higher education system in Tunisia has experienced a rapid expansion and the number of students has more than tripled over the past 10 years from approximately 102,000 in 1995 to 365,000 in 2005. The gross enrollment rate at the tertiary level in 2007 was 31 percent, with gender parity index of GER of 1.5.<ref name="Weforum.org"/>

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Tunisia}}[[File:Cité de la culture, Tunis 27 décembre 2014.jpg|thumb|City of Culture in Tunis]]
The culture of Tunisia is mixed due to its long established history of outside influence from people ‒ such as Phoenicians, Romans, Vandals, Byzantines, Arabs, Turks, Italians, Spaniards, and the French ‒ who all left their mark on the country.

===Painting===
[[File:Ariana par Catania.jpg|thumb|Tunisian painting]]
The birth of Tunisian contemporary painting is strongly linked to the School of Tunis, established by a group of artists from Tunisia united by the desire to incorporate native themes and rejecting the influence of Orientalist colonial painting. It was founded in 1949 and brings together French and Tunisian Muslims, Christians and Jews. Pierre Boucherle was its main instigator, along with [[Yahia Turki]], [[Abdelaziz Gorgi]], [[Moses Levy]], Ammar Farhat, and Jules Lellouche. Given its doctrine, some members have therefore turned to the sources of aesthetic Arab-Muslim art: such as miniature Islamic architecture, etc. Expressionist paintings by Amara Debbache, Jellal Ben Abdallah, and Ali Ben Salem are recognized while abstract art captures the imagination of painters like Edgar Naccache, Nello Levy, and [[Hedi Turki]].<ref name="tangka3">{{cite web|url=http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040510/http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archivedate= 7 October 2011 |title=Un pays pour les peintres |publisher=Guide Tangka |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

After independence in 1956, the art movement in Tunisia was propelled by the dynamics of nation building and by artists serving the state. A Ministry of Culture was established, under the leadership of ministers such as [[Habib Boularès]] who oversaw art and education and power.<ref name="tangka3"/> Artists gained international recognition such as [[Hatem El Mekki]] or [[Zoubeir Turki]] and influenced a generation of new young painters. Sadok Gmech draws his inspiration from national wealth while Moncef Ben Amor turns to fantasy. In another development, Youssef Rekik reused the technique of painting on glass and founded [[Nja Mahdaoui]] calligraphy with its mystical dimension.<ref name="tangka3"/>

There are currently fifty art galleries housing exhibitions of Tunisian and international artists.<ref name="tunisia online">{{cite web|url=http://www.tunisiaonline.com/culture/culture1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210043336/http://www.tunisiaonline.com/culture/culture1.html |archivedate=10 February 2001 |title=Culture de la Tunisie |publisher=Tunisia Online |date=10 February 2001 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> These galleries include Gallery Yahia in Tunis and Carthage Essaadi gallery.<ref name="tunisia online"/>

[[File:Abdelwahab Meddeb - Comédie du Livre 2011 - Montpellier - P1150907.jpg|thumb|[[Abdelwahab Meddeb]]]]
Tunisian literature exists in two forms: Arabic and French. Arabic literature dates back to the 7th century with the arrival of Arab civilization in the region. It is more important in both volume and value than French literature, introduced during the French protectorate from 1881.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.francophonie.philo.ulg.ac.be/TUN.Lettres |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224065850/http://www.francophonie.philo.ulg.ac.be/TUN.Lettres |archivedate=24 December 2007 |title=La littérature tunisienne de langue française (Mémoire vive) |date=24 December 2007 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref>

As for poetry, Tunisian poetry typically opts for nonconformity and innovation with poets such as [[Aboul-Qacem Echebbi]].

As for literature in French, it is characterized by its critical approach. Contrary to the pessimism of [[Albert Memmi]], who predicted that Tunisian literature was sentenced to die young,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040510/http://guides.tangka.com/tunisie/Chapt8Sub1.htm |archivedate= 7 October 2011 |title=Littérature francophone |publisher=Guide Tangka |date=7 October 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> a high number of Tunisian writers are abroad including [[Abdelwahab Meddeb]], Bakri Tahar, [[Mustapha Tlili]], Hele Beji, or Mellah Fawzi.

At the beginning of the 20th century, musical activity was dominated by the liturgical repertoire associated with different religious brotherhoods and secular repertoire which consisted of instrumental pieces and songs in different Andalusian forms and styles of origins, essentially borrowing characteristics of musical language. In 1930 "[[The Rachidia]]" was founded well known thanks to artists from the Jewish community. The founding in 1934 of a musical school helped revive Arab Andalusian music largely to a social and cultural revival led by the elite of the time who became aware of the risks of loss of the musical heritage and which they believed threatened the foundations of Tunisian national identity. The institution did not take long to assemble a group of musicians, poets, scholars. The creation of Radio Tunis in 1938 allowed musicians a greater opportunity to disseminate their works.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Notable Tunisian musicians include [[Saber Rebaï]], [[Dhafer Youssef]], [[Belgacem Bouguenna]], [[Sonia M'barek]] and [[Latifa (singer)|Latifa]], [[Salah El Mahdi]], [[Anouar Brahem]], and [[Lotfi Bouchnak]].

===Media===
{{main|Media of Tunisia}}
The TV media has long remained under the domination of the Establishment of the Broadcasting Authority Tunisia (ERTT) and its predecessor, the Tunisian Radio and Television, founded in 1957. On 7 November 2006, President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali announced the demerger of the business, which became effective on 31 August 2007. Until then, ERTT managed all public television stations ([[Télévision Tunisienne 1]] as well as Télévision Tunisienne 2 which had replaced the defunct RTT 2) and four national radio stations (Radio Tunis, Tunisia Radio Culture, Youth and Radio RTCI) and five regional Sfax, Monastir, Gafsa, Le Kef and Tataouine. Most programs are in Arabic but some are in French. Growth in private sector radio and television broadcasting has seen the creation of numerous operations including Radio Mosaique FM, Jawhara FM, Zaytuna FM, [[Hannibal TV]], Ettounsiya TV, and [[Nessma TV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magharebia.com/cocoon/awi/xhtml1/en_GB/features/awi/features/2010/10/05/feature-02 |title=Shems FM hits Tunisia airwaves |author=Houda Trabelsi |publisher=Magharebia.com |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tunispro.net/tunisia/tv-in-tunisia.htm |title=Television TV in Tunisia |publisher=TunisPro |date= |accessdate=19 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030143827/http://www.tunispro.net/tunisia/tv-in-tunisia.htm |archive-date=30 October 2012 |dead-url=yes  }}</ref>

Before the recent democratic transition, although freedom of the press was formally guaranteed by the constitution, almost all newspapers have in practice followed the government line report. Critical approach to the activities of the president, government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally Party (then in power) were suppressed. In essence, the media was dominated by state authorities through the [[Agence Tunis Afrique Presse]]. This has changed since, as the media censorship by the authorities have been largely abolished, and self-censorship has significantly decreased.<ref name="freedomhouse.org">{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/tunisia|title=Tunisia|publisher=|date=23 April 2015}}</ref> Nonetheless, the current regulatory framework and social and political culture mean that the future of press and media freedom is still unclear.<ref name="freedomhouse.org"/>

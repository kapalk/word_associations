Inhabited since the Paleolithic Age, the [[Slavic migrations]] to the [[Balkans]] in the 6th century established several sovereign [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|states]] in the early Middle Ages which at times nominally recognized being a tributary state to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] and [[Royal Hungary|Hungarian]] kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]] obtained recognition by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and [[Constantinople]] in 1217, reaching its peak in 1346 as a relatively short-lived [[Serbian Empire]]. By the mid-16th century, the entire modern-day Serbia was annexed by the [[Ottomans]], [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|at times interrupted]] by the [[Habsburg Empire]], which [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|started expanding]] towards [[Central Serbia]] from the end of the 17th century, while maintaining a foothold in modern-day [[Vojvodina]].

==Etymology==
{{see also|Names of the Serbs and Serbia|Origin hypotheses of the Serbs}}
The origin of the name, ''"Serbia"'' is unclear. Various authors mentioned names of [[Serbs]] ({{lang-sr|Srbi}} / Срби) and [[Sorbs]] ([[Upper Sorbian language|Upper Sorbian]]: ''Serbja''; [[Lower Sorbian language|Lower Sorbian]]: ''Serby'') in different variants: Surbii, Suurbi, Serbloi, Zeriuani, Sorabi, Surben, Sarbi, Serbii, Serboi, Zirbi, Surbi, Sorben,{{sfn|Petković|1926|p=9}} etc. These authors used these names to refer to Serbs and Sorbs in areas where their historical (or current) presence was/is not disputed (notably in the [[Balkans]] and [[Lusatia]]), but there are also sources that mention same or similar names in other parts of the World (most notably in the Asiatic [[Sarmatia]] in the [[Caucasus]]).

Theoretically, the root *sъrbъ has been variously connected with Russian ''paserb'' (пасерб, "stepson"), Ukrainian ''pryserbytysia'' (присербитися, "join in"), Old [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] ''sarbh-'' ("fight, cut, kill"), Latin ''sero'' ("make up, constitute"), and Greek ''siro'' (ειρω, "repeat").<ref>{{cite web|title=Этимология слова серб|publisher=DicList.ru|url=http://diclist.ru/slovar/fasmera/r/serb.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011060838/http://diclist.ru/slovar/fasmera/r/serb.html|archivedate=11 October 2016}}</ref> However, Polish linguist [[Stanisław Rospond]] (1906–1982) derived the denomination of ''Srb'' from ''srbati'' ([[cf.]] ''sorbo'', ''absorbo'').{{sfn|Lukaszewicz|1998|p=132}} Sorbian scholar H. Schuster-Šewc suggested a connection with the Proto-Slavic verb for "to slurp" *sьrb-, with cognates such as ''сёрбать'' (Russian), ''сьорбати'' (Ukrainian), ''сёрбаць'' (Belarusian), ''srbati'' (Slovak), ''сърбам'' (Bulgarian) and ''серебати'' (Old Russian).<ref>{{cite web|author=H. Schuster-Šewc|url=http://www.rastko.rs/rastko-lu/jezik/hsuster-srbin.html|title=Порекло и историја етнонима|others=translation by Тања Петровић}}</ref>

From 1945 to 1963, the official name for Serbia was the ''People's Republic of Serbia'', which became the ''[[Socialist Republic of Serbia]]'' from 1963 to 1990. Since 1990, the official name of the country is the ''"Republic of Serbia"''. However, between the period from 1992 to 2006, the official names of the country were the ''Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'' and the ''State Union of Serbia and Montenegro''.<ref name="EBRD Country Promotion Programme" />

Archeological evidence of [[Paleolithic]] settlements on the territory of present-day Serbia are scarce.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered much of the territory in the 2nd century BC. In 167 BC the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] was established; the remainder was conquered around 75 BC, forming the Roman province of [[Moesia Superior]]; the modern-day [[Srem District|Srem]] region was conquered in 9 BC; and Bačka and Banat in 106 AD after the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]]. As a result of this, contemporary Serbia extends fully or partially over several former Roman provinces, including [[Moesia]], [[Pannonia]], [[Praevalitana]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Dacia]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]].

The chief towns of [[Upper Moesia]] (and wider) were: Singidunum (Belgrade), [[Viminacium]] (now [[Kostolac|Old Kostolac]]), [[Remesiana]] (now [[Bela Palanka]]), Naissos (Niš), and [[Sirmium]] (now [[Sremska Mitrovica]]), the latter of which served as a Roman capital during the [[Tetrarchy]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/index.php?show=clanak&id_clanak_jezik=14662|title=Southern Pannonia during the age of the Great Migrations|first=Stanko|last= Andrić|journal=Scrinia Slavonica|issn=1332-4853|volume=2|date=October 2002|accessdate=27 February 2012|issue=1|page=117}}</ref> Seventeen Roman Emperors were born in the area of modern-day Serbia, second only to contemporary Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitserbia.org/Culture-85-24-1|title=Culture in Serbia – Tourism in Serbia, Culture travel to Serbia|publisher=VisitSerbia.org|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> The most famous of these was [[Constantine the Great]], the first Christian Emperor, who issued an edict ordering [[Edict of Milan|religious tolerance throughout the Empire]].

===Slavic period===
{{Main|Serbia in the Middle Ages}}
Serbs, a Slavic tribe that settled in the Balkans in the 6th or early 7th century, established the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]] by the 8th century. It was said in 822 that the Serbs inhabited the greater part of Roman Dalmatia, their territory spanning what is today southwestern Serbia and parts of neighbouring countries. Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. Christianity was adopted by the Serbian rulers in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanjić dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanjić period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Serbian Despotate]] was finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1459. The Ottoman threat and eventual conquest saw large migrations of Serbs to the west and north.{{sfn|Ćorović|2001|loc=ch. I}}

===Ottoman and Habsburg rule===
{{Main|Ottoman Serbia|Great Migrations of the Serbs}}

After the loss of independence to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the Ottoman Empire, Serbia briefly regained sovereignty under [[Jovan Nenad]] in the 16th century. Three Habsburg invasions and numerous rebellions constantly challenged Ottoman rule. One famous incident was the [[Banat Uprising]] in 1595, which was part of the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] between the Ottomans and the [[Habsburgs]].<ref>Agoston-Masters:''Encyclopaedia of the Ottoman Empire'' {{ISBN|0-8160-6259-5}}, p.518</ref> The area of modern Vojvodina endured a century-long Ottoman occupation before being ceded to the [[Habsburg Empire]] at the end of the 17th century under the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]].

In all Serb lands south of the rivers Danube and Sava, the nobility was eliminated and the peasantry was [[Serfdom|enserfed]] to Ottoman masters, while much of the clergy fled or were confined to the isolated monasteries. Under the Ottoman system, Serbs, as Christians, were considered an [[rayah|inferior class]] of people and subjected to heavy taxes, and a small portion of the Serbian populace experienced [[Islamisation]]. The Ottomans abolished the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] (1463), but reestablished it in 1557, providing for limited continuation of Serbian cultural traditions within the empire.<ref>S.Aksin Somel, ''Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire,'' Scarecrow Press, Oxford, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8108-4332-3}} p 268</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Somel|first1=Selcuk Aksin|title=The A to Z of the Ottoman Empire|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1461731764|page=268|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UU8iCY0OZmcC&dq=1459+serbian+patriarchate+ottoman}}</ref>

As the [[Great Serb Migrations]] depopulated most of southern Serbia, the Serbs sought refuge across the Danube River in [[Vojvodina]] to the north and the [[Military Frontier]] in the west, where they were granted rights by the Austrian crown under measures such as the ''Statuta Wallachorum'' of 1630. The ecclesiastical center of the Serbs also moved northwards, to the Metropolitanate of [[Sremski Karlovci]], as the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć]] was once-again abolished by the Ottomans in 1766.<ref>Jelavich, Barbara.

In 1718–39, the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] occupied [[Central Serbia]] and established the "[[Kingdom of Serbia (1718–39)|Kingdom of Serbia]]". Apart from Vojvodina and [[Zemun|Northern Belgrade]] which were absorbed into the Habsburg Empire, Central Serbia was occupied by the Habsburgs again in [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686–91)|1686–91]] and [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788–92)|in 1788–92]].

Following the clashes between the Ottoman army and Serbs in Belgrade in 1862, and under pressure from the [[Great Powers]], by 1867 the last Turkish soldiers left the Principality, making the country ''de facto'' independent. By enacting a new constitution without consulting the Porte, [[Jovan Ristic|Serbian diplomats]] confirmed the ''de facto'' independence of the country.

In the course of the [[First Balkan War]] in 1912, the [[Balkan League]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire]] and captured its [[Treaty of London, 1913|European territories]], which enabled territorial expansion into [[Raška (region)|Raška]] and Kosovo. The [[Second Balkan War]] soon ensued when Bulgaria turned on its former allies, but was defeated, resulting in the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]]. In two years, Serbia enlarged its territory by 80% and its population by 50%;{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} it also suffered high casualties on the eve of World War I, with around 20,000 dead.<ref>[http://www.cdsee.org/pdf/WorkBook3_sr.pdf Balkanski ratovi] {{sr icon}} {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304163618/http://www.cdsee.org/pdf/WorkBook3_sr.pdf |date=4 March 2012 }}</ref> Austria-Hungary became wary of the rising regional power on its borders and its potential to become an anchor for unification of all South Slavs, and the relationship between the two countries became tense.

In 1941, in spite of Yugoslav attempts to remain neutral in the war, the [[Axis powers]] invaded Yugoslavia.

During this period, hundreds of thousands of ethnic Serbs fled the Axis [[puppet state]] known as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] and sought refuge in German-occupied Serbia, seeking to escape the large-scale persecution and genocide of Serbs, Jews, and Roma being committed by the [[Ustaše]] regime.<ref>{{cite web|website=Britannica OnlineEncyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/620426/Ustasa|title=Ustaša|publisher=Britannica.com|accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref>

In response, the UN imposed [[Sanctions against Serbia|sanctions]] against Serbia which led to political isolation and the collapse of the economy (GDP decreased from $24 billion in 1990 to under $10 billion in 1993).

Multi-party democracy was introduced in Serbia in 1990, officially dismantling the one-party system. Critics of Milošević claimed that the government continued to be authoritarian despite constitutional changes, as Milošević maintained strong political influence over the state media and security apparatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hague.bard.edu/reports/de_la_brosse_pt1.pdf|title=Political Propaganda and the Plan to Create a "State for all Serbs"|accessdate=14 November 2010}}</ref><ref>''Wide Angle, Milosevic and the Media.''

In 1998, [[Insurgency in Kosovo (1995–98)|continued clashes]] between the Albanian guerilla [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] and Yugoslav security forces led to the short [[Kosovo War]] (1998–99), in which [[NATO]] intervened, leading to the withdrawal of Serbian forces and the establishment of [[UNMIK|UN administration]] in the province.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/kosovo/110492.stm|title=History, bloody history|publisher=BBC News|date=24 March 1999|accessdate=27 July 2012}}</ref>

After [[Yugoslavian general election, 2000|presidential elections]] in September 2000, opposition parties accused Milošević of [[electoral fraud]]. A campaign of [[civil resistance]] followed, led by the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] (DOS), a broad coalition of anti-Milošević parties. This culminated on 5 October when half a million people from all over the country congregated in Belgrade, compelling Milošević to concede defeat.<ref>Ivan Vejvoda, 'Civil Society versus Slobodan Milošević: Serbia 1991–2000', in [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present.''

Milošević was sent to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]. The DOS announced that FR Yugoslavia would seek to join the [[European Union]]. In 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]]; the EU opened negotiations with the country for the [[Stabilization and Association Agreement]]. Serbia's political climate remained tense and in 2003, the Prime Minister [[Zoran Đinđić]] was [[Assassination of Zoran Đinđić|assassinated]] as result of a plot originating from circles of organized crime and former security officials.

{{Main|Climate of Serbia}}
[[File:Veliki Krš.jpg|thumb|[[Veliki Krš]], [[Serbian Carpathians]]]]

The climate of Serbia is under the influences of the landmass of Eurasia and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and [[Mediterranean Sea]]. With mean January temperatures around {{convert|0|C|F}}, and mean July temperatures of {{convert|22|C|F}}, it can be classified as a [[humid continental climate|warm-humid continental]]  or [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>''The Times Atlas of the World'' (1993).

In the south, summers and autumns are drier, and winters are relatively cold, with heavy inland snowfall in the mountains.

Differences in elevation, proximity to the Adriatic Sea and large river basins, as well as exposure to the winds account for climate variations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-92892/Serbia |title=Serbia :: Climate |year=2007 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |pages=5 of 71 }}</ref> Southern Serbia is subject to Mediterranean influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ri.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> The Dinaric Alps and other mountain ranges contribute to the cooling of most of the warm air masses.

==Culture==
{{Main|Serbian culture}}

For centuries straddling the boundaries between East and West, the territory of Serbia had been divided among the Eastern and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves of the [[Roman Empire]]; then between [[Byzantium]] and the Kingdom of Hungary; and in the Early modern period between the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]]. These overlapping influences have resulted in cultural varieties throughout Serbia; its north leans to the profile of Central Europe, while the south is characteristic of the wider Balkans and even the Mediterranean. The Byzantine influence on Serbia was profound, firstly through the introduction of [[Eastern Christianity]] (Orthodoxy) in the Early Middle Ages. The Serbian Orthodox Church has had an enduring status in Serbia, with the [[List of Serb Orthodox monasteries|many Serbian monasteries]] constituting the most valuable cultural monuments left from [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]]. Serbia has seen influences of [[Republic of Venice]] as well, mainly though trade, literature and [[Romanesque art|romanesque architecture]].
[[File:Kosovo_Maiden,_Uro%C5%A1_Predi%C4%87,_1919.jpg|thumb|''[[Kosovo Maiden]]'' by [[Uroš Predić]], arguably one of the most famous Serbian paintings, depicts a girl helping wounded warriors after [[Kosovo Battle]] in 1389]]

Serbia has five cultural monuments inscribed in the list of [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage]]: the early medieval capital [[Stari Ras]] and the 13th-century monastery [[Sopoćani]]; the 12th-century [[Studenica monastery]]; the Roman complex of [[Gamzigrad|Gamzigrad–Felix Romuliana]]; medieval tombstones [[Stećci]]; and finally the endangered [[Medieval Monuments in Kosovo]] (the monasteries of [[Visoki Dečani]], [[Our Lady of Ljeviš]], [[Gračanica Monastery|Gračanica]] and [[Patriarchal Monastery of Peć]]).

There are two literary monuments on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme]]: the 12th-century ''[[Miroslav Gospel]]'', and scientist [[Nikola Tesla]]'s valuable archive. The ''[[slava]]'' (patron saint veneration), [[kolo (dance)|kolo]] (traditional folk dance) and singing to the accompaniment of the [[gusle]] are inscribed on [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]]. The [[Minister of Culture (Serbia)|Ministry of Culture and Information]] is tasked with preserving the nation's [[Cultural Heritage of Serbia|cultural heritage]] and overseeing its development. Further activities supporting development of culture are undertaken at local government level.

Traces of Roman and early Byzantine Empire architectural heritage are found in many royal cities and palaces in Serbia, like [[Sirmium]], [[Gamzigrad|Felix Romuliana]] and [[Justiniana Prima]].

Serbian monasteries are the pinnacle of Serbian medieval art. At the beginning, they were under the influence of [[Byzantine Art]] which was particularly felt after the fall of Constantinople in 1204, when many Byzantine artists fled to Serbia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The most noted of these monasteries is [[Studenica monastery|Studenica]] (built around 1190). It was a model for later monasteries, like the [[Mileševa]], [[Sopoćani]], [[Žiča]], [[Gračanica monastery|Gračanica]] and [[Visoki Dečani]]. In the end of 14th and the 15th centuries, autochotonous architectural style known as [[Morava architectural school|Morava style]] evolved in area around Morava Valley. A characteristic of this style was the wealthy decoration of the frontal church walls. Examples of this include [[Manasija]], [[Ravanica]] and [[Kalenić Monastery|Kalenić]] monasteries. 

Icons and fresco paintings are often considered the peak of Serbian art. The most famous frescos are [[White Angel]] (Mileševa monastery), ''Crucifixion'' (Studenica monastery) and ''Dormition of the Virgin'' (Sopoćani).

Country is dotted with many well-preserved medieval fortifications and castles such as [[Smederevo Fortress]] (largest lowland fortress in Europe), [[Golubac Fortress|Golubac]], [[Maglič]], [[Soko Grad (Sokobanja)|Soko grad]], [[Ostrvica Fortress|Ostrvica]] and [[Ram Fortress|Ram]].

During the time of Ottoman occupation, Serbian art was virtually non-existent, with the exception of several Serbian artists who lived in the lands ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Traditional Serbian art showed some [[Baroque]] influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of [[Nikola Nešković]], [[Teodor Kračun]], [[Zaharije Orfelin]] and Jakov Orfelin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/dmedakovic-art_xviii-xix.html |title=Art in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries |publisher=rastko.rs |accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>

Serbian painting showed the influence of [[Biedermeier]], [[Neoclassicism]] and Romanticism during the 19th century. The most important Serbian painters of the first half of the 20th century were [[Paja Jovanović]] and [[Uroš Predić]] of [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], Cubist [[Sava Šumanović]], [[Milena Pavlović-Barili]] and [[Nadežda Petrović]] of Impressionism, Expressionist [[Milan Konjović]]. Noted painters of the second half of 20th century include [[Marko Čelebonović]], [[Petar Lubarda]], [[Milo Milunović]], and [[Vladimir Veličković]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/mprotic-art_xx_a.html |title=Painting and sculpture in the twentieth century |publisher=rastko.rs |accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>

[[Anastas Jovanović]] was one of the earliest photographes in the world, while [[Marina Abramović]] is one of the world leading performance artists. [[Pirot carpet]] is known as one of the most important traditional handicrafts in Serbia.

There are around 100 art museums in Serbia, of which the most prominent is the [[National Museum of Serbia]], founded in 1844; it houses one of the largest art collections in the Balkans with more than 400,000 exhibits, over 5,600 paintings and 8,400 drawings and prints, including many foreign masterpiece collections. Other art museums of note are [[Museum of Contemporary Art (Belgrade)|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in Belgrade and [[Museum of Vojvodina]] in Novi Sad.

===Literature===

[[File:Miroslav's Gospel 001.jpg|thumb|[[Miroslav's Gospel]] (1186)]]

The beginning of Serbian literacy dates back to the activity of the brothers [[Cyril and Methodius]] in the Balkans. Monuments of Serbian literacy from the early 11th century can be found, written in [[Glagolitic]]. Starting in the 12th century, books were written in [[Cyrillic]]. From this epoch, the oldest Serbian Cyrillic book editorial are the [[Miroslav Gospels]] from 1186. ''The Miroslav Gospels'' are considered to be the oldest book of Serbian medieval history and as such has entered [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Register]].<ref name=mow>{{cite web|title= Miroslav Gospel – Manuscript from 1180 |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/flagship-project-activities/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page-5/miroslav-gospel-manuscript-from-1180/| date=19 January 2014 |publisher=UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate=14 December 2009}}</ref>

The ''[[Kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' is the traditional collective folk dance, which has [[Serbian dances|a number of varieties]] throughout the regions. The most popular are those from [[Užice]] and Morava region. [[Serbian epic poetry|Sung epic poetry]] has been an integral part of Serbian and Balkan music for centuries. In the highlands of Serbia these long poems are typically accompanied on a one-string fiddle called the ''[[gusle]]'', and concern themselves with themes from history and mythology. There are records of ''gusle'' being played at the court of the 13th-century King [[Stefan Nemanjić]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/rpejovic-medieval_music.html|title=Roksanda Pejovic – Medieval music |publisher=rastko.rs |accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>

[[Serbian pop|Pop music]] has mainstream popularity. [[Željko Joksimović]] won second place at the [[2004 Eurovision Song Contest]] and [[Marija Šerifović]] managed to win the [[2007 Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[Molitva]]", and Serbia was the host of the [[2008 Eurovision Song Contest|2008 edition]] of the contest. Most popular pop singers include likes of [[Đorđe Balašević]], [[Goca Tržan]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Aleksandra Radović]], [[Vlado Georgiev]], [[Jelena Tomašević]] and [[Nataša Bekvalac]] among others.

The [[Serbian rock]] which was during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s part of [[SFR Yugoslav pop and rock scene|former Yugoslav rock scene]], used to be well developed, featuring various rock genres, and was well covered in the media, which included numerous magazines, radio and TV shows. During the 1990s and 2000s popularity of rock music declined in Serbia, and although several major mainstream acts managed to sustain their popularity, an [[underground music|underground]] and [[independent music]] scene developed. The 2000s saw a revival of the mainstream scene and the appearance of a large number of notable acts. The most notable Serbian rock acts include [[Bajaga i Instruktori]], [[Disciplina Kičme]], [[Ekatarina Velika]], [[Električni Orgazam]], [[Eva Braun (band)|Eva Braun]], [[Kerber]], [[Neverne Bebe]], [[Partibrejkers]], [[Ritam Nereda]], [[Orthodox Celts]], [[Rambo Amadeus]], [[Riblja Čorba]], [[SARS (band)|S.A.R.S.]], [[Smak]], [[Van Gogh (band)|Van Gogh]], [[YU Grupa]] and others.

Folk music in its original form has been a prominent music style since [[World War One]] following the early success of [[Sofka Nikolić]]. The music has been further promoted by Danica Obrenić, Anđelija Milić, [[Nada Mamula]], and even later, during 60s and 70s, with stars like [[Silvana Armenulić]], [[Toma Zdravković]], [[Lepa Lukić]], Vasilija Radojčić, Vida Pavlović and Gordana Stojićević.

[[Turbo-folk]] music is subgenre that has developed in Serbia in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s and has since enjoyed an immense popularity through acts of [[Dragana Mirković]], [[Zorica Brunclik]], [[Šaban Šaulić]], [[Ana Bekuta]], [[Sinan Sakić]], [[Vesna Zmijanac]], [[Mile Kitić]], Snežana Đurišić, [[Šemsa Suljaković]], and [[Nada Topčagić]]. It is a blend of [[folk music]] with [[Pop music|pop]] and/or [[Dance music|dance]] elements and can be seen as a result of the urbanization of folk music. In recent period turbo-folk featured even more pop music elements, and some of the performers were labeled as pop-folk. The most famous among them are [[Svetlana Ražnatović|Ceca]] (often considered to be the biggest music star of Serbia), [[Jelena Karleuša]], [[Aca Lukas]], [[Seka Aleksić]], [[Dara Bubamara]], [[Indira Radić]], [[Saša Matić]], [[Viki Miljković]], [[Stoja]] and [[Lepa Brena]], arguably the most prominent performer of former [[Yugoslavia]].

[[Balkan Brass Band|Balkan Brass]], or ''truba'' ("trumpet") is a popular genre, especially in Central and Southern Serbia where Balkan Brass originated. The music has its tradition from the [[First Serbian Uprising]]. The trumpet was used as a military instrument to wake and gather soldiers and announce battles, the trumpet took on the role of entertainment during downtime, as soldiers used it to transpose popular folk songs. When the war ended and the soldiers returned to the rural life, the music entered civilian life and eventually became a music style, accompanying births, baptisms, weddings, and funerals. There are two main varieties of this genre, one from Western Serbia and the other from Southern Serbia. The best known Serbian Brass musician is [[Boban Marković]], also one of the biggest names in the world of modern brass band bandleaders.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Serbian cuisine}}
[[File:Serbian Christmas meal.jpg|thumb|Typical Christmas table in Serbia]]

Serbian cuisine is largely heterogeneous, sharing characteristics of the Balkans (especially [[former Yugoslavia]]), the [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] ([[Greek cuisine|Greek]] in particular), [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], and Central European (especially [[Austrian cuisine|Austrian]] and [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]]) cuisines. Food is very important in Serbian social life, particularly during religious holidays such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and feast days i.e. [[slava]].{{sfn|Albala|2011|p=330}}

Staples of the Serbian diet include bread, meat, fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Bread is the basis of all Serbian meals, and it plays an important role in Serbian cuisine and can be found in religious rituals. A traditional Serbian welcome is to offer bread and [[salt]] to guests. Meat is widely consumed, as is fish. Serbian specialties include [[ćevapčići]] (caseless sausages made of minced meat, which is always grilled and seasoned), [[pljeskavica]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[kajmak]] (a dairy product similar to [[clotted cream]]), [[gibanica]] (cheese and kajmak pie), [[ajvar]] (a roasted red pepper spread), [[proja]] (cornbread), and [[kačamak]] (corn-flour porridge).{{sfn|Albala|2011|pp=329–330}}

Serbians claim their country as the birthplace of [[rakia]] (''rakija''), a highly alcoholic drink primarily distilled from fruit. Rakia in various forms is found throughout the Balkans, notably in Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia, Montenegro, Hungary and Turkey. [[Slivovitz]] (''šljivovica''), a plum brandy, is a type of rakia which is considered the national drink of Serbia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.serbia.travel/about-serbia/typically-serbian/food/ |title=Food |publisher=serbia.travel |accessdate=20 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420144616/https://www.serbia.travel/about-serbia/typically-serbian/food/ |archivedate=20 April 2013  }}</ref>

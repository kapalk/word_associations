Beside Bohemia itself, the [[List of Bohemian monarchs|King of Bohemia]] ruled the [[lands of the Bohemian Crown]], holding a [[Prince-elector|vote in the election of]] the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]; and [[Prague]] was the imperial seat in periods between the 14th and 17th century. In the [[Hussite Wars]] of the 15th century driven by the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Bohemian Reformation]], the kingdom faced economic embargoes and defeated five consecutive [[crusades]] proclaimed by the leaders of the [[Catholic Church]].

Following the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, the whole Crown of Bohemia was gradually integrated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] alongside the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The Protestant [[Bohemian Revolt]] (1618–20) against the Catholic [[Habsburgs]] led to the [[Thirty Years' War]]. After the [[Battle of the White Mountain]], the Habsburgs consolidated their rule, eradicated Protestantism and reimposed Catholicism, and also adopted a policy of gradual [[Germanization]].

In 1968, increasing dissatisfaction with the regime culminated in a reform movement known as the [[Prague Spring]], which ended in a [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]]. Czechoslovakia remained occupied until the 1989 [[Velvet Revolution]], when the communist regime collapsed and market economy was reintroduced. On 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peacefully dissolved]], with its constituent states becoming the independent states of the Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]].

The traditional English name "Bohemia" derives from Latin "Boiohaemum", which means "home of the [[Boii]]".  The current English name comes from the [[Polish language|Polish]] ethnonym associated with the area, which ultimately comes from the Czech word ''Čech''.<ref name="CollinsDictionary">{{cite web|title=Czech definition and meaning|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/czech|website=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins|Collins]]|accessdate=19 November 2012|quote="'''C19: from Polish, from Czech ''Čech'''''"}}</ref><ref name="American Heritage Dictionary">{{cite web|title=Czech|url=https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=Czech|website=[[American Heritage Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|accessdate=24 January 2018|quote="'''[Polish, from Czech ''Čech''.]'''"}}</ref><ref name="OxfordDictionary">{{cite web|title=Czech - Definition in English|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/czech|website=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[Oxford University]]|accessdate=11 April 2018|quote="'''Origin  Polish spelling of Czech ''Čech''.'''"}}</ref> The name comes from the Slavic tribe ({{lang-cs|Češi, Čechové}}) and, according to legend, their leader [[Lech, Čech, and Rus|Čech]], who brought them to Bohemia, to settle on [[Říp Mountain]]. The etymology of the word ''Čech'' can be traced back to the [[Proto-Slavic]] root ''*čel-'', meaning "member of the people; kinsman", thus making it [[cognate (linguistics)|cognate]] to the Czech word ''[[:wiktionary:člověk|člověk]]'' (a person).<ref>{{cite web|last=Spal|first=Jaromír|title=Původ jména Čech|url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=4320|publisher=Naše řeč|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>

The country has been traditionally divided into three lands, namely [[Bohemia]] (''Čechy'') in the west, [[Moravia]] (''Morava'') in the east, and [[Czech Silesia]] (''Slezsko''; the smaller, south-eastern part of [[Silesia|historical Silesia]], most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast. Known as the ''lands of the Bohemian Crown'' since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including ''Czech/Bohemian lands'', ''Bohemian Crown'', ''Czechia'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/letter/from-bohemia-to-czechia|title=From Bohemia to Czechia - Radio Prague}}</ref> and the ''lands of the Crown of [[Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Saint Wenceslas]]''. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]] in 1918, the new name of ''Czechoslovakia'' was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within the one country.

After Czechoslovakia dissolved in 1992, the Czech part lacked a common English short name. The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended the English name ''Czechia'' in 1993, and the Czech government [[Name of the Czech Republic#Adoption of Czechia|approved ''Czechia'']] as the official short name in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vláda schválila doplnení jednoslovného názvu Cesko v cizích jazycích do databází OSN|date=May 5, 2016|url=https://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/archiv_zprav/rok_2016/tiskove_zpravy/x_2016_05_02_vlada_schvalila_czechia.html|language=Czech|website=Ministerstvo zahraničních věcí České republiky|access-date=August 28, 2018|trans-title=The government has approved the addition of one-word Czech name in foreign languages to UN databases}}</ref>

Archaeologists have found evidence of prehistoric human settlements in the area, dating back to the [[Paleolithic]] era. The [[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]], together with a few others from nearby locations, is the oldest known [[ceramic]] article in the world.

In the [[classical era]], from the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, the [[Boii]] gave their name to Bohemia. The Boii founded a city on the site of modern Prague, and some of its ruins are now a tourist attraction. According to a 2000 study by Semino, 35.6% of Czech males have y-chromosome haplogroup R1b,  which is common among Celts but rare among Slavs. There are claims among modern Czechs that the Czech people are as much descendants of the Boii as they are from the later Slavic invaders (as well as the historical Germanic peoples of Czech lands) Later in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there. Their king [[Maroboduus]] is the first documented ruler of Bohemia. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe. Most of the Czech rivers have Celtic or old Germanic name origin.

[[Slavs]] from the [[Black Sea]]–[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region settled in the area (a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from [[Siberia]] and Eastern Europe: [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). In the sixth century, they moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia and some of present-day Austria and Germany.

During the 7th century, the Frankish merchant [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], became the ruler of the first known Slavic state in Central Europe, [[Samo's Empire]]. The principality of [[Great Moravia]], controlled by [[House of Mojmir|Moymir dynasty]], arose in the 8th century and reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of [[Svatopluk I of Moravia]]) when it held off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a crucial role being played by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mission of [[Cyril and Methodius]]. They created the artificial language [[Old Church Slavonic]], the first literary and liturgic language of the [[Slavs]], and the [[Glagolitic alphabet]].

=== Bohemia ===
{{Main|Bohemia}}
[[File:Duchy of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire in 11th century.svg|thumb|left|The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 11th century]]
The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. In 10th century [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia]] conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]] and expanded farther to the east. The Duchy of Bohemia, raised to the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in 1198, was from 1002 until 1806 an [[Imperial State]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] alongside the [[Kingdom of Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and numerous other territories such as the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and various [[Papal States]]. The kingdom was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]].

In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Přemysl Ottokar I]] (bearing the title "king" from 1198) extracted the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the [[Duchy]] of Bohemia was raised to a [[Realm|Kingdom]]. The bull declared that the King of Bohemia would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in imperial councils. German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. Germans populated towns and mining districts and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of Bohemia. In 1235, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]]. After the [[Battle of Legnica]] in Poland, the Mongols carried their raids into Moravia, but were defensively defeated at the fortified town of [[Olomouc]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grousset |first1=René |title=The Empire of the Steppes |date=1970 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHzGvqRbV_IC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> The Mongols subsequently invaded and defeated Hungary.<ref>Jan Dugosz, Maurice Michael (1997) ''The Annals of Jan Dlugosz'', IM Publications, {{ISBN|1-901019-00-4}}</ref>

King [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|Přemysl Otakar II]] earned the nickname ''Iron and Golden King'' because of his military power and wealth. He acquired Austria, [[Styria]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Carniola]], thus spreading the Bohemian territory to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. He met his death at the [[Battle on the Marchfeld]] in 1278 in a war with his rival, King [[Rudolph I of Germany]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiv.radio.cz/history/history03.html |title=The rise and fall of the Przemyslid Dynasty |publisher=Archiv.radio.cz |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217231510/http://archiv.radio.cz/history/history03.html |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df= }}</ref> Ottokar's son [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia|Wenceslaus II]] acquired the Polish crown in 1300 for himself and the Hungarian crown for his son. He built a great empire stretching from the [[Danube river]] to the [[Baltic Sea]]. In 1306, the last king of Přemyslid line [[Wenceslaus III of Bohemia|Wenceslaus III]] was murdered in mysterious circumstances in Olomouc while he was resting. After a series of dynastic wars, the [[House of Luxembourg]] gained the Bohemian throne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panovnici.cz/vaclav-II-kral|title=Václav II. český král|work=panovnici.cz}}</ref>

The 14th century, in particular, the reign of the [[List of rulers of Bohemia|Bohemian king]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] (1316–1378), who in 1346 became [[King of the Romans]] and in 1354 both [[King of Italy]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]], is considered the Golden Age of Czech history. Of particular significance was the founding of [[Charles University in Prague]] in 1348, [[Charles Bridge]], [[Charles Square]]. Much of [[Prague Castle]] and the [[cathedral of Saint Vitus]] in [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] were completed during his reign. He unified [[Brandenburg]] (until 1415), [[Lusatia]] (until 1635), and [[Silesia]] (until 1742) under the Bohemian crown.

[[Bohemian Reformation]] started around 1402 by [[Jan Hus]]. Although Hus was named a heretic and burnt in [[Konstanz|Constance]] in 1415, his followers (led by warlords [[Jan Žižka]] and [[Prokop the Great]]) seceded from the Catholic Church and in the [[Hussite Wars]] (1419–1434) defeated five crusades organized against them by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]]. [[Petr Chelčický]] continued with the [[Hussites|Hussite movement]]. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemian and Moravian lands were considered Hussites. Hussite [[George of Podebrady]] was even a king. Hus's thoughts were a major influence on the later [[Lutheranism]]. [[Martin Luther]] himself said "we are all Hussites, without having been aware of it" and considered himself as Hus's direct successor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.luther2017.de/en/reformation/and-its-people/jan-hus/|title=Mentor and precursor of the Reformation}}</ref>

After 1526 Bohemia came increasingly under [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] control as the Habsburgs became first the elected and then in 1627 the hereditary rulers of Bohemia. The [[Austrian Habsburgs#Division of the house: Spanish and Austrian Habsburgs|Austrian Habsburgs]] of the 16th century, the founders of the central European [[Habsburg Monarchy]], were buried in Prague. Between 1583–1611 Prague was the official seat of the Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and his court.

The [[Defenestrations of Prague|Defenestration of Prague]] and subsequent revolt against the Habsburgs in 1618 marked the start of the [[Thirty Years' War]], which quickly spread throughout Central Europe. In 1620, the rebellion in Bohemia was crushed at the [[Battle of White Mountain]], and the ties between Bohemia and the Habsburgs' hereditary lands in Austria were strengthened. The leaders of the [[Bohemian Revolt]] were [[Old Town Square execution|executed in 1621]]. The nobility and the middle class Protestants had to either convert to Catholicism or leave the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Protestantism in Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic)|url=http://www.museeprotestant.org/en/notice/protestantism-in-the-republic-of-czechoslovakia/|website=Virtual Museum of Protestantism|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref>

The following period, from 1620 to the late 18th century, has often been called colloquially the "Dark Age". The population of the [[Czech lands]] declined by a third through the expulsion of Czech Protestants as well as due to the war, disease and famine.<ref>Oskar Krejčí, Martin C.

The reigns of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and co-regent from 1765, were characterized by [[enlightened absolutism]]. In 1740, most of Silesia (except the southernmost area) was seized by King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in the [[Silesian Wars]]. In 1757 the Prussians invaded Bohemia and after the [[Battle of Prague (1757)]] occupied the city. More than one quarter of Prague was destroyed and [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] also suffered heavy damage. Frederick was defeated soon after at the [[Battle of Kolín]] and had to leave Prague and retreat from Bohemia. In 1770 and 1771 [[Famines in Czech lands|Great Famine]] killed about one tenth of the Czech population, or 250,000 inhabitants, and radicalized the countryside leading to peasant uprisings.<ref>"''The Cambridge economic history of Europe: The economic organization of early modern Europe''".

[[Joseph Radetzky von Radetz]], born to a noble Czech family, was a [[field marshal]] and chief of the general staff of the Austrian Empire army during these wars.

The end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1806 led to degradation of the political status of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Bohemia lost its position of an [[Prince-elector|electorate]] of the Holy Roman Empire as well as its own political representation in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hlavačka|first1=Milan|title=Formování moderního českého národa 1815–1914|journal=Historický Obzor|date=2009|volume=20|issue=9/10|page=195|language=Czech}}</ref> Bohemian lands became part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and later of [[Austria–Hungary]].

In 1866 Austria was defeated by Prussia in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (see also [[Battle of Königgrätz]] and [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]]). The Austrian Empire needed to redefine itself to maintain unity in the face of nationalism. At first it seemed that some concessions would be made also to Bohemia, but in the end the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] effected a compromise with Hungary only. The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] and the never realized coronation of Franz Joseph as King of Bohemia led to a huge disappointment of Czech politicians.<ref name="auto" /> The Bohemian Crown lands became part of the so-called [[Cisleithania]] (officially "The Kingdoms and Lands represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]]").

Prague [[Pacifism|pacifist]] [[Bertha von Suttner]] was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1905. In the same year, the Czech Social Democratic and progressive politicians (including [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]]) started the fight for universal suffrage. The first elections under [[Universal suffrage|universal male suffrage]] were held in 1907. The last King of Bohemia was [[Charles I of Austria]] who ruled in 1916–1918.

An estimated 1.4&nbsp;million Czech soldiers fought in World War I, of whom some 150,000 died. Although the majority of Czech soldiers fought for the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], more than 90,000 Czech volunteers formed the [[Czechoslovak Legion]]s in France, Italy and Russia, where they fought against the [[Central Powers]] and later against [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] troops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/cz/zpravy/105664 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120914064737/http://www.radio.cz/cz/zpravy/105664 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 September 2012 |title=Radio Praha – zprávy |accessdate=13 September 2014 }}</ref> In 1918, during the collapse of the Habsburg Empire at the end of World War I, the independent republic of [[Czechoslovakia]], which joined the winning Allied powers, was created, with [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] in the lead.

Although the [[First Czechoslovak Republic]] was a [[unitary state]], it provided what were at the time rather extensive rights to its minorities and remained the only democracy in this part of Europe in the interwar period. The effects of the [[Great Depression]] including high unemployment and massive propaganda from Nazi Germany, however, resulted in discontent and strong support among ethnic Germans for a break from Czechoslovakia.

[[Adolf Hitler]] took advantage of this opportunity and using [[Konrad Henlein]]'s separatist [[Sudeten German Party]], gained the largely German speaking [[Sudetenland]] (and its substantial [[Maginot Line]]-like [[Czechoslovak border fortifications|border fortifications]]) through the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]] (signed by [[Nazi Germany]], France, Britain, and Italy). Czechoslovakia was not invited to the conference, and Czechs and Slovaks call the Munich Agreement the [[Western betrayal|Munich Betrayal]] because France (which had an alliance with Czechoslovakia) and Britain gave up Czechoslovakia instead of facing Hitler, which later proved inevitable.

Despite the mobilization of 1.2&nbsp;million-strong Czechoslovak army and the Franco-Czech military alliance, Poland annexed the [[Teschen conflict|Zaolzie]] area around [[Český Těšín]]; Hungary gained parts of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus as a result of the [[First Vienna Award]] in November 1938. The remainders of Slovakia and the Subcarpathian Rus gained greater autonomy, with the state renamed to "[[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czecho-Slovakia]]". After Nazi Germany threatened to annex part of Slovakia, allowing the remaining regions to be partitioned by Hungary and Poland, Slovakia chose to maintain its national and territorial integrity, seceding from Czecho-Slovakia in March 1939, and allying itself, as demanded by Germany, with Hitler's coalition.<ref>Gerhard L.

The remaining Czech territory was [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|occupied by Germany]], which transformed it into the so-called [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. The protectorate was proclaimed part of the Third Reich, and the president and prime minister were subordinated to the Nazi Germany's ''[[Protector (title)|Reichsprotektor]]''. Subcarpathian Rus declared independence as the Republic of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]] on 15 March 1939 but was invaded by Hungary the same day and formally annexed the next day. Approximately 345,000 Czechoslovak citizens, including 277,000 Jews, were killed or executed while hundreds of thousands of others were sent to prisons and [[Nazi concentration camps]] or used as forced labor. Up to two-thirds of the citizens were in groups targeted by the Nazis for deportation or death.<ref>Stephen A. Garrett (1996).

There was [[Resistance in German-occupied Czechoslovakia|Czech resistance to Nazi occupation]], both at home and abroad, most notably with the [[Operation Anthropoid|assassination of Nazi German leader]] [[Reinhard Heydrich]] by Czechoslovakian soldiers [[Jozef Gabčík]] and [[Jan Kubiš]] in a Prague suburb on 27 May 1942. On 9 June 1942 Hitler ordered bloody reprisals against the Czechs as a response to the Czech anti-Nazi resistance. The [[Edvard Beneš]]'s [[Czechoslovak government-in-exile]] and its army fought against the Germans and were acknowledged by the Allies; Czech/Czechoslovak troops fought from the very beginning of the war in Poland, France, the UK, North Africa, the Middle East and the Soviet Union (see [[I Corps (Czechoslovakia)|I Czechoslovakian Corps]]). The German occupation ended on 9 May 1945, with the arrival of the Soviet and American armies and the [[Prague uprising]]. An estimated 140,000 Soviet soldiers died in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JyN0hlKcfTcC&pg=PA409#v=onepage A Companion to Russian History]''".

In 1945–1946, almost the entire German-speaking minority in Czechoslovakia, about 3 million people, [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II#Czechoslovakia|were expelled]] to Germany and Austria (see also [[Beneš decrees]]). During this time, thousands of Germans were held in prisons and detention camps or used as forced labor. In the summer of 1945, there were several massacres, such as the [[Postoloprty]] massacre. Research by a joint German and Czech commission of historians in 1995 found that the death toll of the expulsions was at least 15,000 persons and that it could range up to a maximum of 30,000 dead.<ref name="ReferenceC">Gemeinsame Deutsch-Tschechischee Historikerkommission,

Following a Soviet-organized referendum, the Subcarpathian Rus never returned under Czechoslovak rule but became part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]], as the [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] in 1946.

Czechoslovakia uneasily tried to play the role of a "bridge" between the West and East. However, the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]] rapidly increased in popularity, with a general disillusionment with the West, because of the pre-war [[Munich Agreement]], and a favourable popular attitude towards the Soviet Union, because of the Soviets' role in liberating Czechoslovakia from German rule. In the [[Czechoslovakian parliamentary election, 1946|1946 elections]], the Communists gained 38%<ref>F. Čapka: [http://www.libri.cz/databaze/dejiny/text/t98.html Dějiny zemí Koruny české v datech].

They formed a coalition government with other parties of the [[National Front (Czechoslovakia)|National Front]] and moved quickly to consolidate power. A significant change came in 1948 with [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'état|coup d'état by the Communist Party]]. The Communist [[People's Militias (Czechoslovakia)|People's Militias]] secured control of key locations in Prague, and a single party government was formed.

[[File:10 Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia - Flickr - The Central Intelligence Agency.jpg|thumb|The [[Prague Spring]] political liberalization of the communist regime was stopped by the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]].]]
For the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948–1989)|next 41 years]], Czechoslovakia was a Communist state within the [[Eastern Bloc]]. This period is characterized by lagging behind the West in almost every aspect of social and economic development. The country's GDP per capita fell from the level of neighboring Austria below that of Greece or Portugal in the 1980s. The Communist government completely [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the [[means of production]] and established a [[Planned economy|command economy]]. The economy grew rapidly during the 1950s but slowed down in the 1960s and 1970s and stagnated in the 1980s.

The political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s, including numerous [[show trial]]s (the most famous victims: [[Milada Horáková]] and [[Rudolf Slánský]]) and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners, but became more open and tolerant in the late 1960s, culminating in [[Alexander Dubček]]'s leadership in the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], which tried to create "[[socialism with a human face]]" and perhaps even introduce political [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. This was forcibly ended by [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] by all [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries with the exception of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] on 21 August 1968. Student [[Jan Palach]] became a symbol of resistance to the occupation, when he committed [[self-immolation]] as a political protest.

The invasion was followed by a harsh program of "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|Normalization]]" in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Until 1989, the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition. Dissidents published [[Charter 77]] in 1977, and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988. Between 1948 and 1989 about 250,000 Czechs and Slovaks were sent to prison for political reasons, and over 400,000 emigrated.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4388764.stm|title=Czech schools revisit communism|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

=== Velvet Revolution and the European Union ===
{{Main|Velvet Revolution|Dissolution of Czechoslovakia}}
[[File:Vaclav Havel cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Václav Havel]], first [[President of the Czech Republic]]]]

In November 1989, Czechoslovakia returned to a liberal democracy through the peaceful "[[Velvet Revolution]]" (led by [[Václav Havel]] and his [[Civic Forum]]). However, Slovak national aspirations strengthened (see [[Hyphen War]]) and on 1 January 1993, the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|country peacefully split]] into the independent Czech Republic and [[Slovakia]]. Both countries went through economic reforms and [[privatisation]]s, with the intention of creating a [[market economy]]. This process was largely successful; in 2006 the Czech Republic was recognized by the World Bank as a "developed country",<ref name="worldbank06" /> and in 2009 the [[Human Development Index]] ranked it as a nation of "Very High Human Development".<ref name="hdi09">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2009|work=UNDP.org |accessdate=25 April 2010}}</ref>

From 1991, the Czech Republic, originally as part of Czechoslovakia and since 1993 in its own right, has been a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] and from 1995, the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]. The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the Czech Republic joined the [[Schengen Area]]. Until 2017, either the [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]] (under [[Miloš Zeman]], [[Vladimír Špidla]], [[Stanislav Gross]], [[Jiří Paroubek]] and [[Bohuslav Sobotka]]), or [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|liberal-conservatives]] (under [[Václav Klaus]], [[Mirek Topolánek]] and [[Petr Nečas]]) led the government of the Czech Republic.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of the Czech Republic}}
[[File:CzechRepublic-geographic map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map]]
The Czech Republic lies mostly between latitudes [[48th parallel north|48°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]] (a small area lies north of 51°), and longitudes [[12th meridian east|12°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]].

The Czech landscape is exceedingly varied. [[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkonoše]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sněžka]] at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder]] River ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).

Water from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|adj=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Western European broadleaf forests]], Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.

There are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is [[Krkonoše National Park]] ([[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]]), and the others are [[Šumava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), [[Podyjí National Park]], [[Bohemian Switzerland]].

The three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly the core countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond almost perfectly with the river basins of the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).

The Czech Republic mostly has a temperate [[oceanic climate]], with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters. The temperature difference between summer and winter is relatively high, due to the landlocked geographical position.<ref>R. Tolasz, ''Climate Atlas of the Czech Republic'', Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, Prague, 2007. {{ISBN|80-244-1626-3}}, graphs 1.5 and 1.6</ref>

Within the Czech Republic, temperatures vary greatly, depending on the elevation. In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[Bílý Potok (Liberec District)|Bílý Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of [[Prague]]. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.

At the highest peak of [[Sněžka]] ({{convert|1603|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=or}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|0}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, [[Prague]], has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.

The coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is usually snow in the mountains and sometimes in the major cities and lowlands. During March, April and May, the temperature usually increases rapidly, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary widely during the day. Spring is also characterized by high water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.

The warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} – {{convert|30|C-change|F-change}} higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.

Autumn generally begins in September, which is still relatively warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below {{convert|15|C|F}} or {{convert|10|C|F}} and [[deciduous]] trees begin to shed their leaves. By the end of November, temperatures usually range around the freezing point.

The coldest temperature ever measured was in Litvínovice near [[České Budějovice]] in 1929, at {{convert|-42.2|C|F}} and the hottest measured, was at {{convert|40.4|C|F}} in [[Dobřichovice]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Czech absolute record temperature registered near Prague|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-absolute-record-temperature-registered-near-prague/830626|work=České noviny|publisher=ČTK|accessdate=20 August 2012}}</ref>

Most rain falls during the summer. Sporadic rainfall is relatively constant throughout the year (in Prague, the average number of days per month experiencing at least 0.1&nbsp;mm of rain varies from 12 in September and October to 16 in November) but concentrated heavy rainfall (days with more than 10&nbsp;mm per day) are more frequent in the months of May to August (average around two such days per month).<ref>R.

The Czech Republic is a pluralist multi-party [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], with the [[President of the Czech Republic|President]] as [[head of state]] and [[Prime Minister of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] as [[head of government]]. The [[Parliament of the Czech Republic|Parliament]] (''Parlament České republiky'') is bicameral, with the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic|Chamber of Deputies]] ({{lang-cs|Poslanecká sněmovna}}) (200 members) and the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Senate]] ({{lang-cs|Senát}}) (81 members).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.psp.cz/en/docs/laws/constitution.html |title=The Constitution of the Czech Republic – Article 16 |publisher=Czech Republic |accessdate=8 August 2015}}</ref>

The president is a formal head of state with limited and specific powers, most importantly to return bills to the parliament, appoint members to the board of the [[Czech National Bank]], nominate [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|constitutional court]] judges for the Senate's approval and dissolve the Chamber of Deputies under certain special and unusual circumstances. The president and vice president of the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Court]] are appointed by the President of the Republic. He also appoints the prime minister, as well the other members of the cabinet on a proposal by the prime minister. From 1993 until 2012, the [[President of the Czech Republic]] was selected by a joint session of the parliament for a five-year term, with no more than two consecutive terms (2x [[Václav Havel]], 2x [[Václav Klaus]]). Since 2013 the presidential election is direct.<ref>{{cite news|title=Klaus signs Czech direct presidential election implementing law|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/tema/zpravy/klaus-signs-czech-direct-presidential-election-implementing-law/823441|publisher=Czech Press Agency|date=1 August 2012|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> [[Miloš Zeman]] was the first [[Czech presidential election, 2013|directly elected]] Czech President.

The [[Government of the Czech Republic]]'s exercise of executive power derives from the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]].

The [[Member of Parliament#Czech Republic|members of the Chamber of Deputies]] are elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]], with a 5% [[election threshold]]. There are 14 voting districts, identical to the country's administrative regions. The Chamber of Deputies, the successor to the [[Czech National Council]], has the powers and responsibilities of the now defunct federal parliament of the former Czechoslovakia.

The members of the Senate are elected in single-seat [[electoral district|constituencies]] by two-round [[Two-round system|runoff voting]] for a six-year term, with one-third elected every even year in the autumn. The first election was in 1996, for differing terms. This arrangement is modeled on the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], but each constituency is roughly the same size and the voting system used is a two-round runoff.

The Czech Republic is a [[unitary state]] with a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law system]] based on the continental type, rooted in Germanic legal culture. The basis of the legal system is the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic]] adopted in 1993. The [[Criminal code|Penal Code]] is effective from 2010. A new [[Civil code]] became effective in 2014. The court system includes district, county and supreme courts and is divided into civil, criminal, and administrative branches. The Czech judiciary has a [[triumvirate]] of supreme courts. The [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]] consists of 15 constitutional judges and oversees violations of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Constitution]] by either the legislature or by the [[Government of the Czech Republic|government]]. The [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Court]] is formed of 67 judges and is the court of highest appeal for almost all [[legal case]]s heard in the Czech Republic. The [[Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic|Supreme Administrative Court]] decides on issues of procedural and administrative propriety. It also has jurisdiction over many political matters, such as the formation and closure of political parties, jurisdictional boundaries between government entities, and the eligibility of persons to stand for public office. The Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court are both based in [[Brno]], as is the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office.

{{Main|Army of the Czech Republic}}
The [[Army of the Czech Republic|Czech armed forces]] consist of the [[Czech Land Forces]], the [[Czech Air Force]] and of specialized support units. The armed forces are managed by the [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Defence]]. The [[President of the Czech Republic]] is [[Commander-in-chief]] of the armed forces. In 2004 the army transformed itself into a fully professional organization and compulsory military service was abolished. The country has been a member of [[NATO]] since 12 March 1999. Defense spending is approximately 1.04% of the GDP (2015).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mocr.army.cz/finance-a-zakazky/resortni-rozpocet/resortni-rozpocet-5146/ |title=Resortní rozpočet |publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic]] |access-date=8 August 2015}}</ref> The armed forces are charged with protecting the Czech Republic and its allies, promoting global security interests, and contributing to NATO.

Currently, as a member of NATO, the Czech military are participating in [[Kosovo Force|KFOR]] and [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] (renamed to [[Resolute Support Mission|Resolute Support]]) operations and have soldiers in [[Afghanistan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Operation Atalanta|Somalia]], [[Israel]] and [[Mali]].

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{See also|Regions of the Czech Republic|List of districts of the Czech Republic}}
Since 2000, the Czech Republic has been divided into [[Regions of the Czech Republic|thirteen regions]] ([[Czech language|Czech]]: [[wikt:en:kraj#Czech|''kraje'', singular ''kraj'']]) and the capital city of [[Prague]]. Every region has its own elected regional assembly (''krajské zastupitelstvo'') and ''hejtman'' (a regional governor). In Prague, the assembly and presidential powers are executed by the city council and the mayor.

The older seventy-six [[List of districts of the Czech Republic|districts]] (''okresy'', singular ''[[okres]]'') including three "statutory cities" (without Prague, which had special status) lost most of their importance in 1999 in an administrative reform; they remain as territorial divisions and seats of various branches of state administration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/article/36046|title=The death of the districts|accessdate=13 September 2014}}</ref>

=== Energy ===
{{Main|Energy in the Czech Republic}}
[[File:Nuclear.power.plant.Dukovany.jpg|thumb|[[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station]]]]
Production of Czech electricity exceeds consumption by about 10 [[Kilowatt hour|TWh]] per year, which are exported. [[Nuclear power]] presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]]; and 4.6 percent from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is [[Temelín Nuclear Power Station]], another [[nuclear power plant]] is in [[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station|Dukovany]].

The Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[Lignite|brown coal]] as a source of energy. Natural gas is procured from Russian [[Gazprom]], roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption and from Norwegian companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth. Russian gas is imported via Ukraine ([[Druzhba pipeline]]), Norwegian gas is transported through Germany. Gas consumption (approx. 100 TWh in 2003–2005) is almost double electricity consumption. South Moravia has small [[Oil and gas deposits in the Czech Republic|oil and gas deposits]].

=== Science and philosophy ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2019}}
The Czech lands have a long and rich scientific tradition. The research based on cooperation between [[List of universities in the Czech Republic|universities]], [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Academy of Sciences]] and specialized research centers brings new inventions and impulses in this area. Important inventions include the modern [[contact lens]], the separation of modern [[blood type]]s, the modern genetics, many inventions in nanotechnologies and the production of [[Semtex]] [[plastic explosive]].

==== Humanities ====
[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Jan Hus]] (1369 – 1415) is a key figure of the [[Bohemian Reformation]] and inspired the pre-[[Protestant]] [[Hussite movement]].]]
[[Cyril and Methodius]] laid the foundations of education and the Czech theological thinking in the 9th century. Original theological and philosophical stream – [[Hussitism]] – originated in the Middle Ages. It was represented by [[Jan Hus]], [[Jerome of Prague]] or [[Petr Chelčický]]. At the end of the Middle Ages, [[Jan Amos Comenius]] substantially contributed to the development of modern pedagogy. Jewish philosophy in the Czech lands was represented mainly by [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (known for the legend of the [[Golem]] of Prague). [[Bernard Bolzano]] was the personality of German-speaking philosophy in the Czech lands. [[Bohuslav Balbín]] was a key Czech philosopher and historian of the Baroque era. He also started the struggle for rescuing the Czech language. This culminated in the [[Czech national revival]] in the first half of the 19th century. Linguistics ([[Josef Dobrovský]], [[Pavel Jozef Šafařík]], [[Josef Jungmann]]), etnography ([[Karel Jaromír Erben]], [[František Ladislav Čelakovský]]) and history ([[František Palacký]]) played a big role in revival. Palacký was the eminent personality. He wrote the first synthetic history of the Czech nation. He was also the first Czech modern politician and geopolitician (see also [[Austro-Slavism]]). He is often called "The Father of the Nation".

In the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century there was a huge development of social sciences. [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] laid the foundations of Czech sociology. [[Konstantin Jireček]] founded Byzantology (see also [[Jireček Line]]). [[Alois Musil]] was a prominent orientalist, [[Emil Holub]] ethnographer. [[Lubor Niederle]] was a founder of modern Czech archeology. [[Sigmund Freud]] established psychoanalysis. [[Edmund Husserl]] defined a new philosophical doctrine – phenomenology. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] brought genuine economic ideas of "creative destruction" of capitalism. [[Hans Kelsen]] was significant legal theorist. [[Karl Kautsky]] influenced the history of Marxism. On the contrary, economist [[Eugen Böhm von Bawerk]] led a campaign against Marxism. [[Max Wertheimer]] was one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology. Musicologists [[Eduard Hanslick]] and [[Guido Adler]] influenced debates on the development of classical music in Vienna.

The new Czechoslovak republic (1918–1938) wanted to develop sciences. Significant linguistic school was established in Prague – [[Prague Linguistic Circle]] ([[Vilém Mathesius]], [[Jan Mukařovský]], [[René Wellek]]), moreover linguist [[Bedřich Hrozný]] deciphered the ancient Hittite language and linguist [[Julius Pokorny]] deepened knowledge about Celtic languages. Philosopher [[Herbert Feigl]] was a member of the Vienna Circle. [[Ladislav Klíma]] has developed a special version of Nietzschean philosophy. In the second half of the 20th century can be mentioned philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]] who is considered one of the leading theoreticians on the issue of nationalism. Also Czech historian [[Miroslav Hroch]] analyzed modern nationalism. [[Vilém Flusser]] developed the philosophy of technology and image. Marxist [[Karel Kosík]] was a major philosopher in the background of the Prague Spring 1968. [[Jan Patočka]] and [[Václav Havel]] were the main ideologists of the Charter 77. [[Egon Bondy]] was a major philosophical spokesman of the Czech underground in the 1970s and 1980s. Czech Egyptology has scored some successes, its main representative is [[Miroslav Verner]]. Czech psychologist [[Stanislav Grof]] developed a method of "Holotropic Breathwork". Experimental archaeologist [[Pavel Pavel]] made several attempts, they had to answer the question how ancient civilizations transported heavy weights.

Christianization in the 9th and 10th centuries introduced [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. After the [[Bohemian Reformation]], most Czechs became [[Hussites|followers]] of [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chelčický]] and other regional [[Protestant Reformers]]. [[Taborites]] and [[Utraquists]] were major [[Hussite]] groups. During the [[Hussite Wars]], Utraquists sided with the Catholic Church. Following the joint Utraquist—Catholic victory, Utraquism was accepted as a distinct form of Christianity to be practiced in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] by the [[Catholic Church]] while all remaining Hussite groups were prohibited. After the [[Reformation]], some Bohemians went with the [[Lutheranism|teachings of Martin Luther]], especially [[Sudeten Germans]]. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly [[anti-Catholic]] stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions (notably Taborites) were revived. After the [[Habsburgs]] regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Catholicism—even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A long history of resistance to the Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing [[secularization]]. Protestantism never recovered after the [[Counter-Reformation]] was introduced by the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian Habsburgs]] in 1620.

According to the 2011 census, 34% of the population stated they had no religion, 10.3% was Catholic, 0.8% was [[Protestant]] (0.5% [[Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren|Czech Brethren]] and 0.4% [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church|Hussite]]<ref>The [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] contains mixed Protestant, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and national elements. Classifying it as either one is disputable. For more details and dispute about this, see [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]].</ref>), and 9% followed other forms of religion both denominational or not (of which 863 people answered they are [[Neopaganism|Pagan]]). 45% of the population did not answer the question about religion.<ref name="Czech Statistical Office" /> From 1991 to 2001 and further to 2011 the adherence to Catholicism decreased from 39% to 27% and then to 10%; Protestantism similarly declined from 3.7% to 2% and then to 0.8%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.czso.cz/csu/2008edicniplan.nsf/engt/24003E05ED/$File/4032080119.pdf|title= Population by denomination and sex: as measured by 1921, 1930, 1950, 1991 and 2001 censuses|language=Czech, English|accessdate=9 March 2010|publisher=Czech Statistical Office}}</ref>

[[Venus of Dolní Věstonice]] is the treasure of prehistoric art. [[Theodoric of Prague]] was the most famous Czech painter in the Gothic era. For example, he decorated the castle Karlstejn. In the Baroque era, the famous painters were [[Wenceslaus Hollar]], [[Jan Kupecký]], [[Karel Škréta]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]] or [[Petr Brandl]], sculptors [[Matthias Braun]] and [[Ferdinand Brokoff]]. In the first half of the 19th century, [[Josef Mánes]] joined the romantic movement. In the second half of the 19th century had the main say the so-called "National Theatre generation": sculptor [[Josef Václav Myslbek]] and painters [[Mikoláš Aleš]], [[Václav Brožík]], [[Vojtěch Hynais]] or [[Julius Mařák]]. At the end of the century came a wave of [[Art Nouveau]]. Alfons Mucha became the main representative. He is today the most famous Czech painter.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He is mainly known for [[Art Nouveau]] posters and his cycle of 20 large canvases named [[the Slav Epic]], which depicts the history of Czechs and other [[Slavs]].

{{As of|2012}}, [[the Slav Epic]] can be seen in the Veletržní Palace of the [[National Gallery in Prague]], which manages the largest collection of art in the Czech Republic. [[Max Švabinský]] was another important Art nouveau painter. The 20th century brought avant-garde revolution. In the Czech lands mainly expressionist and cubist: [[Josef Čapek]], [[Emil Filla]], [[Bohumil Kubišta]], [[Jan Zrzavý]]. Surrealism emerged particularly in the work of [[Toyen]], [[Josef Šíma]] and [[Karel Teige]]. In the world, however, he pushed mainly [[František Kupka]], a pioneer of abstract painting. As illustrators and cartoonists in the first half of the 20th century gained fame [[Josef Lada]], [[Zdeněk Burian]] or [[Emil Orlík]]. Art photography has become a new field ([[František Drtikol]], [[Josef Sudek]], later [[Jan Saudek]] or [[Josef Koudelka]]).

The earliest preserved stone buildings in Bohemia and Moravia date back to the time of the [[Christianization]] in the 9th and 10th century. Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] ([[St. George's Basilica, Prague|St. George's Basilica]], [[St. Procopius Basilica in Třebíč]]). During the 13th century it was replaced by the [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] ([[Charles Bridge]], [[Bethlehem Chapel]], [[Old New Synagogue]], [[Sedlec Ossuary]], [[Old Town Hall (Prague)|Old Town Hall]] with [[Prague astronomical clock]], [[Church of Our Lady before Týn]]). In the 14th century Emperor Charles IV invited to his court in Prague talented architects from France and Germany, [[Matthias of Arras]] and [[Peter Parler]] ([[Karlštejn]], [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], [[St. Barbara's Church, Kutná Hora|St. Barbara's Church in Kutná Hora]]). During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as many monasteries ([[Strahov Monastery]], [[Špilberk]], [[Křivoklát Castle]], [[Vyšší Brod Monastery]]). During the [[Hussite wars]], many of them were damaged or destroyed.

The [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be slowly mixed with Renaissance elements (architects [[Matěj Rejsek]], [[Benedikt Rejt]] and their [[Powder Tower]]). An outstanding example of the pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the [[Royal Summer Palace]], which was situated in a newly established garden of [[Prague Castle]]. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving a massive influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious châteaux with elegant arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens ([[Litomyšl Castle]], [[Hluboká Castle]]).<ref name=architecture>{{cite web|title=History of Czech Architecture|url=http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|website=eu2009.cz|publisher=Czech Presidency of the European Union|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.<ref name=czecharchitecture>{{cite web|title=The History of Architecture|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|website=www.czech.cz|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

In the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia. Very outstanding are the architectural projects of the Czech nobleman and imperial generalissimo [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] from the 1620s ([[Wallenstein Palace]]). His architects Andrea Spezza and [[Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni|Giovanni Pieroni]] reflected the most recent Italian production and were very innovative at the same time. [[Czech Baroque architecture]] is considered to be a unique part of the European cultural heritage thanks to its extensiveness and extraordinariness ([[Kroměříž Castle]], [[Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc]], [[St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)|St. Nicholas Church at Malá Strana]], [[Karlova Koruna Chateau]]). In the first third of the 18th century the Bohemian lands were one of the leading artistic centers of the Baroque style. In Bohemia there was completed the development of the Radical Baroque style created in Italy by [[Francesco Borromini]] and [[Guarino Guarini]] in a very original way.<ref name=kotalik>{{cite book|last=Kotalík|first=Jiří|title=Architektura barokní|year=2002|publisher=Správa Pražského hradu a DaDa|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-86161-38-9|page=13|edition=Deset století architektury|language=Czech}}</ref> Leading architects of the Bohemian Baroque were [[Jean Baptiste Mathey|Jean-Baptiste Mathey]], [[František Maxmilián Kaňka]], [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]], and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]].

In the 18th century Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity – the ''Baroque Gothic style'', a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles. This was not a simple return to Gothic details, but rather an original Baroque transformation. The main representative and originator of this style was [[Jan Blažej Santini-Aichel]], who used this style in renovating medieval monastic buildings or in [[Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk]].<ref name=architecture />

During the 19th century, the [[Revival architecture|revival architectural styles]] were very popular in the Bohemian monarchy. Many churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed many new buildings in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] styles ([[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], [[Lednice–Valtice Cultural Landscape]], [[Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Brno|Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Brno]]). At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the new art style appeared in the Czech lands – [[Art Nouveau]]. The best-known representatives of Czech Art Nouveau architecture were [[Osvald Polívka]], who designed the [[Municipal House]] in Prague, [[Josef Fanta]], the architect of the [[Praha hlavní nádraží|Prague Main Railway Station]], [[Jan Letzel]], [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Jan Kotěra]].

Bohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the [[Cubism]] of painting and sculpture into architecture ([[House of the Black Madonna]]). During the first years of the independent Czechoslovakia (after 1918), a specifically Czech architectural style, called ''Rondo-Cubism'', came into existence. Together with the pre-war [[Cubism#Czech Cubist architecture|Czech Cubist architecture]] it is unparalleled elsewhere in the world. The first Czechoslovak president [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]] invited the prominent [[Slovenia|Slovene]] architect [[Jože Plečnik]] to Prague, where he modernized the [[Prague Castle|Castle]] and built some other buildings ([[Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord]]).

Between World Wars I and II, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style in the newly established Czechoslovak Republic. In the city of Brno, one of the most impressive functionalist works has been preserved – [[Villa Tugendhat]], designed by the architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=architecture /> The most significant Czech architects of this era were [[Adolf Loos]], [[Pavel Janák]] and [[Josef Gočár]].

After World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became strongly Soviet influenced. [[Hotel International Prague|Hotel International]] in Prague is a brilliant example of the so-called [[Socialist realism]], the Stalinistic art style of the 1950s. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement known as the ''[[Brussels style]]'' (named after the Brussels World's Fair [[Expo 58]]) became popular in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. [[Brutalism]] dominated in the 70s and 80s ([[Kotva Department Store]]).

Even today, the Czech Republic is not shying away from the most modern trends of international architecture. This fact is attested to by a number of projects by world-renowned architects ([[Frank Gehry]] and his [[Dancing House]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Ricardo Bofill]], and [[John Pawson]]). There are also contemporary Czech architects whose works can be found all over the world ([[Vlado Milunić]], [[Eva Jiřičná]], [[Jan Kaplický]]).<ref name=architecture />

In a strict sense, [[Czech literature]] is the literature written in the [[Czech language]]. A more liberal definition incorporates all literary works written in the Czech lands regardless of language. The literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in [[Latin]] and German or even [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Thus [[Franz Kafka]], who—while bilingual in Czech and German{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164–210}}—wrote his works (''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'') in German, during the era of Austrian rule, can represent the [[Czech literature|Czech]], German or [[Austrian literature]] depending on the point of view.

Influential Czech authors who wrote in Latin include [[Cosmas of Prague]] († 1125), [[Martin of Opava]] († 1278), [[Peter of Zittau]] († 1339), [[Jan Hus|John Hus]] († 1415), [[Bohuslav Hasištejnský z Lobkovic]] (1461–1510), [[Jan Dubravius]] (1486–1553), [[Tadeáš Hájek]] (1525–1600), [[Johannes Vodnianus Campanus]] (1572–1622), [[John Amos Comenius]] (1592–1670), and [[Bohuslav Balbín]] (1621–1688).

In the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of the German [[Minnesang]] and courtly literature ([[Reinmar von Zweter]], [[Heinrich von Freiberg]], Ulrich von Etzenbach, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]). The most famous Czech medieval German-language work is the ''Ploughman of Bohemia'' (''[[Der Ackermann aus Böhmen]]''), written around 1401 by [[Johannes von Tepl]]. The heyday of Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century, which is represented by the well-known names of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Max Brod]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Egon Kisch|Egon Erwin Kisch]], and others.

[[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translations]] played an important role in the development of Czech literature and the standard Czech language. The oldest Czech translation of the [[Psalms]] originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488 ([[Prague Bible]]). The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593 and is known as the [[Bible of Kralice]]. The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.

Czech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages ([[Chronicle of Dalimil]]); the Hussite period ([[Tomáš Štítný ze Štítného]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chelčický]]); the [[Renaissance humanism]] ([[Henry the Younger of Poděbrady]], [[Luke of Prague]], [[Wenceslaus Hajek]], [[Jan Blahoslav]], [[Daniel Adam z Veleslavína]]); the Baroque period ([[John Amos Comenius]], [[Adam Václav Michna z Otradovic]], [[Bedřich Bridel]], [[Jan František Beckovský]]); the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century ([[Václav Matěj Kramerius]], [[Karel Hynek Mácha]], [[Karel Jaromír Erben]], [[Karel Havlíček Borovský]], [[Božena Němcová]], [[Ján Kollár]], [[Josef Kajetán Tyl]]), modern literature in second half of the 19th century ([[Jan Neruda]], [[Alois Jirásek]], [[Viktor Dyk]], [[Jaroslav Vrchlický]], [[Julius Zeyer]], [[Svatopluk Čech]]); the avant-garde of the interwar period ([[Karel Čapek]], [[Jaroslav Hašek]], [[Vítězslav Nezval]], [[Jaroslav Seifert]], [[Jiří Wolker]], [[Vladimír Holan]]); the years under Communism and the Prague Spring ([[Josef Škvorecký]], [[Bohumil Hrabal]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Arnošt Lustig]], [[Václav Havel]], [[Pavel Kohout]], [[Ivan Klíma]]); and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic ([[Ivan Martin Jirous]], [[Michal Viewegh]], [[Jáchym Topol]], [[Patrik Ouředník]], [[Kateřina Tučková]]).

Noted journalists include [[Julius Fučík (journalist)|Julius Fučík]], [[Milena Jesenská]], and [[Ferdinand Peroutka]].

[[Jaroslav Seifert]] was the only Czech writer awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. The famous antiwar comedy novel ''[[The Good Soldier Švejk]]'' by [[Jaroslav Hašek]] is the most translated Czech book in history. It was adapted by [[Karel Steklý]] in two color films ''[[The Good Soldier Schweik (1956 film)|The Good Soldier Schweik]]'' in 1956 and 1957. Widely translated Czech books are also Milan Kundera's ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' and Karel Čapek's ''[[War with the Newts]]''.

The international literary award the [[Franz Kafka Prize]] is awarded in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franzkafka-soc.cz/cena-franze-kafky/|title=Společnost Franze Kafky – Cena Franze Kafky|website=www.franzkafka-soc.cz}}</ref>

Czech literature and culture played a major role on at least two occasions when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

{{Main|Music of the Czech Lands|Moravian traditional music}}

The musical tradition of the Czech lands arose from first church hymns, whose first evidence is suggested at the break of 10th and 11th century. The first significant pieces of Czech music include two chorales, which in their time performed the function of anthems: "Hospodine pomiluj ny" ([[Hospodine pomiluj ny|Lord, Have Mercy on Us]]) from around 1050, unmistakably the oldest and most faithfully preserved popular spiritual song to have survived to the present, and the [[hymn]] "Svatý Václave" ([[Saint Wenceslas]]) or "[[Saint Wenceslas Chorale]]" from around 1250.<ref>The chronicles of Beneš Krabice of Veitmil – the hymn "Svatý Václave" mentioned there as old and well-known in the end of the 13th century [http://www.clavmon.cz/clavis/FRRB/chronica/CRONICA%20ECCLESIAE%20PRAGENSIS.htm]</ref> Its roots can be found in the 12th century and it still belongs to the most popular religious songs to this day. In 1918, in the beginning of the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] state, the song was discussed as one of the possible choices for the national anthem. The authorship of the anthem "Lord, Have Mercy on Us" is ascribed by some historians to [[Saint Adalbert of Prague]] (sv.Vojtěch), bishop of [[Prague]], living between 956 and 997.<ref>Dějiny české hudby v obrazech (History of Czech music in pictures); in Czech</ref>

The wealth of musical culture in the Czech Republic lies in the long-term high-culture classical music tradition during all historical periods, especially in the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], [[Classical period (music)|Classicism]], Romantic, [[Modernism (music)|modern classical]] music and in the [[traditional music|traditional]] folk music of Bohemia, Moravia and [[Silesia]]. Since the early era of artificial music, Czech musicians and composers have often been influenced the folk music of the region and dances (e.g. the [[polka]], which originated in Bohemia). Among the most notable Czech composers are [[Adam Michna]], [[Jan Dismas Zelenka]], [[Johann Stamitz|Jan Václav Antonín Stamic]], [[Jiří Antonín Benda]], [[Johann Baptist Wanhal|Jan Křtitel Vaňhal]], [[Josef Mysliveček]], [[Heinrich Biber]], [[Anton Reicha|Antonín Rejcha]], [[František Xaver Richter]], [[František Brixi]] and [[Jan Ladislav Dussek]] in baroque era, [[Bedřich Smetana]] and [[Antonín Dvořák]] in romanticism, [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Josef Suk (composer)|Josef Suk]], [[Leoš Janáček]], [[Bohuslav Martinů]], [[Vítězslav Novák]], [[Zdeněk Fibich]], [[Alois Hába]], [[Viktor Ullmann]], [[Ervín Schulhoff]], [[Pavel Haas]], [[Josef Bohuslav Foerster]] in modern classical music, [[Miloslav Kabeláč]] and [[Petr Eben]] in contemporary classical music.

Other examples of famous musicians, interpreters and conductors are [[František Benda]], [[Rafael Kubelík]], [[Jan Kubelík]], [[David Popper]], [[Alice Herz-Sommer]], [[Rudolf Serkin]], [[Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst]], [[Otakar Ševčík]], [[Václav Neumann]], [[Václav Talich]], [[Karel Ančerl]], [[Jiří Bělohlávek]], [[Wojciech Żywny]], [[Emma Destinnová]], [[Magdalena Kožená]], [[Rudolf Firkušný]], [[Czech Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Panocha Quartet]] or non-classical musicians: [[Julius Fučík (composer)|Julius Fučík]] (brass band), [[Karel Svoboda (composer)|Karel Svoboda]] and [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]] (film music), [[Ralph Benatzky]], [[Rudolf Friml]] and [[Oskar Nedbal]] (operetta), [[Jan Hammer]] and [[Karel Gott]] (pop), [[Jaroslav Ježek (composer)|Jaroslav Ježek]] and [[Miroslav Vitouš]] (jazz), [[Karel Kryl]] (folk).

Czech music can be considered to have been beneficial in both the European and worldwide context, several times co-determined or even determined a newly arriving era in musical art,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expats.cz/prague/article/czech-culture/czech-music-history/|title=Czech Music|date=2007-06-27}}</ref> above all of [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] era, as well as by original attitudes in [[Baroque (music)|Baroque]], [[Romantic (music)|Romantic]] and [[modern classical]] music.

The roots of Czech theatre can be found in the Middle Ages, especially in cultural life of [[gothic period]]. In the 19th century, the theatre played an important role in the national awakening movement and later, in the 20th century it became a part of the modern European theatre art. Original Czech cultural phenomenon came into being at the end of the 1950s. This project called [[Laterna magika]] (The Magic Lantern) was the brainchild of renowned film and theater director [[Alfred Radok]], resulting in productions that combined theater, dance and film in a poetic manner, considered the first [[multimedia art]] project in international context.

The most famous Czech drama is [[Karel Čapek]]'s play ''[[R.U.R.]]'', which introduced the word "[[robot]]".

=== Film ===
{{Main|Cinema of the Czech Republic}}

The tradition of Czech cinematography started in the second half of the 1890s. Peaks of the production in the era of silent movies include the historical drama ''The Builder of the Temple'' and the social and erotic (very controversial and innovative at that time) drama ''Erotikon'' directed by [[Gustav Machatý]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2015/06/gustav-machatys-erotikon-1929-ekstase-1933-cinemas-earliest-explorations-of-womens-sensuality.html|title=Gustav Machatý's Erotikon (1929) & Ekstase (1933): Cinema's Earliest Explorations of Women's Sensuality|work=Open Culture}}</ref> The early Czech [[sound film]] era was very productive, above all in mainstream genres, especially the comedies of [[Martin Frič]] or [[Karel Lamač]]. However, dramatic movies were more internationally successful. Among the most successful being the [[romantic drama]] [[Ecstasy (film)|''Ecstasy'']] by Gustav Machatý and the romantic ''The River'' by [[Josef Rovenský]].

[[File:Fabworldofjulesverne.jpg|thumb|upright|American poster of Karel Zeman's 1958 film ''A Deadly Invention'']]
After the repressive period of Nazi occupation and early communist official dramaturgy of socialist realism in movies at the turn of the 1940s and 1950s with a few exceptions such as ''[[Krakatit]]'' by [[Otakar Vávra]] or ''Men without wings'' by [[František Čáp]] (awarded by [[Palme d'Or]] of the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1946), a new era of the Czech film began with outstanding animated films by important filmmakers such as [[Karel Zeman]], a pioneer with special effects (culminating in successful films such as artistically exceptional ''Vynález zkázy'' ("A Deadly Invention"), performed in anglophone countries under the name "The Fabulous World of Jules Verne" from 1958, which combined acted drama with animation, and [[Jiří Trnka]], the founder of the modern puppet film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/About-CZ/Facts-about-the-Czech-Republic/History-of-Czech-cinematography|title=History of Czech cinematography}}</ref> This began a strong tradition of animated films ([[Zdeněk Miler]]'s ''[[Mole (Zdeněk Miler character)|Mole]]'' etc.). Another Czech cultural phenomenon came into being at the end of the 1950s. This project called ''[[Laterna magika]]'' ("The Magic Lantern"), resulting in productions that combined theater, dance and film in a poetic manner, considered the first [[multimedia art]] project in international context (mentioned also in [[#Theatre|Theatre section]] above).

In the 1960s, so called Czech New Wave (also [[Czechoslovak New Wave]]) received international acclaim. It is linked with names of [[Miloš Forman]], [[Věra Chytilová]], [[Jiří Menzel]], [[Ján Kadár]], [[Elmar Klos]], [[Evald Schorm]], [[Vojtěch Jasný]], [[Ivan Passer]], [[Jan Schmidt]], [[Juraj Herz]], [[Juraj Jakubisko]], [[Jan Němec]], Jaroslav Papoušek, etc. The hallmark of the films of this movement were long, often improvised [[dialogue]]s, [[Black comedy|black]] and [[absurdity|absurd]] humor and the occupation of non-actors. Directors are trying to preserve natural atmosphere without refinement and artificial arrangement of scenes. The unique personality of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s with original manuscript, deep psychological impact and extraordinarily high quality art is the director [[František Vláčil]]. His films [[Marketa Lazarová]], [[Údolí včel]] ("The Valley of The Bees") or [[Adelheid]] belong to the artistic peaks of Czech cinema production. The film "Marketa Lazarová" was voted the all-time best Czech movie in a prestigious 1998 poll of Czech film critics and publicists. Another internationally well-known author is [[Jan Švankmajer]] (in the beginning of the career conjoined with above mentioned project "Laterna Magika"), a filmmaker and artist whose work spans several media. He is a self-labeled [[surrealism|surrealist]] known for his animations and features, which have greatly influenced many artists worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|title= Brooding Cartoons From Jan Svankmajer |publisher= LA Times|date=19 July 1991|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1991-07-19/entertainment/ca-2291_1_political-cartoon|accessdate=24 August 2010 | first=Charles | last=Solomon}}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Czech cuisine}}
Czech cuisine is marked by a strong emphasis on meat dishes. Pork is quite common; beef and chicken are also popular. Goose, duck, rabbit and wild game are served. Fish is rare, with the occasional exception of fresh [[trout]] and [[carp]], which is served at Christmas.

[[Beer in the Czech Republic|Czech beer]] has a long and important history. The first brewery is known to have existed in 993 and the Czech Republic has the highest [[List of countries by beer consumption per capita|beer consumption per capita]] in the world. The famous "[[pilsner]] style beer" (pils) originated in the western Bohemian city of [[Plzeň]], where the world's first-ever blond lager [[Pilsner Urquell]] is still being produced, making it the inspiration for more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today. Further south the town of [[České Budějovice]], known as Budweis in German, lent its name to its beer, eventually known as [[Budweiser Budvar]]. Apart from these and other major brands, the Czech Republic also has a growing number of small breweries and mini-breweries.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Tourism is slowly growing around the Southern Moravian region too, which has been producing [[Czech wine|wine]] since the Middle Ages; about 94% of [[vineyard]]s in the Czech Republic are Moravian. Aside from [[slivovitz]], Czech beer and wine, the Czechs also produce two unique [[liquor]]s, [[Fernet Stock]] and [[Becherovka]]. [[Kofola]] is a non-alcoholic domestic [[cola]] soft drink which competes with [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] in popularity.

Some popular Czech dishes include:

* ''Vepřo knedlo zelo'': roast pork with bread dumplings and stewed cabbage
* ''[[Svíčková]] na smetaně'': roast sirloin of beef with steamed dumplings and cream of vegetable sauce
* ''Rajská (omáčka)'': beef in tomato sauce, traditionally served with dumplings
* ''Koprová'': beef in dill sauce, traditionally served with dumplings
* ''Pečená kachna'': roast duck with bread or potato dumplings and braised red cabbage
* ''[[Goulash|Guláš]]'': a variety of beef and pork goulash stews, served with dumplings or bread
* ''[[Smažený sýr]]'': fried cheese, typically served with potatoes or french fries and [[tartar sauce]]
* ''[[Potato pancake|Bramboráky]]'': potato pancakes, traditionally served with sour cabbage

There is also a large variety of local sausages, wurst, pâtés, and smoked and cured meats. Czech desserts include a wide variety of whipped cream, chocolate, and fruit pastries and tarts, crêpes, creme desserts and cheese, poppy-seed-filled and other types of traditional cakes such as ''[[Buchteln|buchty]]'', ''[[Kolach|koláče]]'' and [[Apple strudel|''štrúdl'']].

One of the most popular Czech sports is hiking, mainly in the Czech mountains. The word for "tourist" in the Czech language, ''turista'', also means "trekker" or "hiker".

There is a network of around 40,000&nbsp;km of marked short- and long-distance trails crossing the whole country and all the Czech mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expats.cz/prague/article/czech-tourism/hiking-in-the-czech-republic/p1|title=Hiking in the Czech Republic|publisher=Expats|date=2011-06-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kct.cz/cms/turisticke-znaceni-kct|title=Turistické značení KČT|publisher=KČT}}</ref>

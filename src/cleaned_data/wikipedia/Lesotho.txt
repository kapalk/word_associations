===Rule of Moshoeshoe I (1822–1868)===

The present Lesotho, then called Basutoland, emerged as a single [[body politic|polity]] under King [[Moshoeshoe I]] in 1822. Moshoeshoe, a son of Mokhachane, a minor [[tribal chief|chief]] of the Bakoteli lineage, formed his own [[clan]] and became a chief around 1804. Between 1821 and 1823, he and his followers settled at the [[Butha-Buthe]] Mountain, joining with former adversaries in resistance against the [[Mfecane|Lifaqane]] associated with the reign of [[Shaka Zulu]] from 1818 to 1828.

Subsequent evolution of the state hinged on conflicts between [[British Empire|British]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonists leaving the [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] following its seizure from the French-allied Dutch by the British in 1795, and subsequently associated with the [[Orange River Sovereignty]] and subsequent [[Orange Free State]]. [[Missionaries]] invited by Moshoeshoe I, Thomas Arbousset, Eugène Casalis and Constant Gosselin from the [[Paris Evangelical Missionary Society]], placed at [[Morija]], developed [[orthography]] and printed works in the [[Sesotho language]] between 1837 and 1855. Casalis, acting as translator and providing advice on foreign affairs, helped to set up diplomatic channels and acquire guns for use against the encroaching Europeans and the [[Griqua people]].

[[Trekboer]]s from the Cape Colony arrived on the western borders of [[Basutoland]] and claimed land rights, beginning with Jan de Winnaar, who settled in the [[Matlakeng]] area in May–June 1838. As more [[Boer]]s were moving into the area they tried to colonise the land between the two rivers, even north of the [[Caledon River|Caledon]], claiming that it had been abandoned by the Sotho people. Moshoeshoe subsequently signed a treaty with the British Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir [[George Thomas Napier]], that annexed the Orange River Sovereignty that many Boers had settled. These outraged Boers were suppressed in a brief skirmish in 1848. In 1851 a British force was defeated by the Basotho army at Kolonyama, touching off an embarrassing war for the British. After repelling another British attack in 1852, Moshoeshoe sent an appeal to the British commander that settled the dispute diplomatically, then defeated the Batlokoa in 1853.
In 1854 the British pulled out of the region, and in 1858 Moshoeshoe fought a series of wars with the Boers in the [[Free State–Basotho War]], losing a great portion of the western lowlands. The last war in 1867 ended when Moshoeshoe appealed to [[Queen Victoria]], who agreed to make Basutoland a British [[protectorate]] in 1868.

===British rule (1868–1966)===
{{further|Basutoland}}
In 1869, the British signed a treaty at [[Aliwal North]] with the Boers that defined the boundaries of Basutoland, and later Lesotho, which by ceding the western territories effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's [[Realm|Kingdom]] to half its previous size.

Following the [[cession]] in 1869, the British initially transferred functions from Moshoeshoe's capital in [[Thaba Bosiu]] to a police camp on the northwest border, [[Maseru]], until administration of Basutoland was transferred to the Cape Colony in 1871. Moshoeshoe died on 11 March 1870, marking the end of the traditional era and the beginning of the colonial era. He was buried at Thaba Bosiu. In the early years of British rule between 1871 and 1884, Basutoland was treated similarly to other territories that had been forcibly [[annexation|annexed]], much to the chagrin of the Basotho.<ref>{{cite book|title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|author=James S.

In 1884, Basutoland was restored to its status as a protectorate, with Maseru again its [[capital city|capital]], but remained under direct rule by a [[governor]], though effective internal power was wielded by traditional [[tribal chief|chiefs]].

[[File:1959 Basutoland National Council stamps.jpg|left|thumb|1959 stamps for the Basutoland National Council]]

===Independence (1966–present)===
Basutoland gained its independence from Britain and became the Kingdom of Lesotho in 1966.<ref name="hansenvaa">{{cite book|title=Reconsidering Informality: Perspectives from Urban Africa|author=Karen Tranberg Hansen, Mariken Vaa|publisher=Nordic African Institute|year=2004|isbn=91-7106-518-0|page=180}}</ref>

In January 1970, the ruling [[Basotho National Party]] (BNP) lost the [[1970 Lesotho general election|first post-independence general elections]], with 23 seats to the Basutoland Congress Party's 36. Prime Minister [[Leabua Jonathan]] refused to cede power to the [[Basotho Congress Party]] (BCP), declared himself Tona Kholo (Sesotho translation of prime minister), and imprisoned the BCP leadership.

BCP began a [[rebellion]] and then received training in [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Libyan Arab Republic|Libya]] for its [[Lesotho Liberation Army]] (LLA) under the pretense of being [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA) soldiers of the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC). Deprived of arms and supplies by the [[David Sibeko|Sibeko]] faction of the PAC in 1978, the 178-strong LLA was rescued from their [[Tanzania]]n base by the financial assistance of a [[Maoism|Maoist]] PAC officer, but they launched the [[guerrilla war]] with only a handful of old weapons. The main force was defeated in northern Lesotho, and later guerrillas launched sporadic but usually ineffectual attacks. The campaign was severely compromised when BCP's leader, [[Ntsu Mokhehle]], went to [[Pretoria]]. In the early 1980s, several Basotho who sympathised with the exiled BCP were threatened with death and attacked by the government of Leabua Jonathan. On 4 September 1981, the family of Benjamin Masilo was attacked. In the attack his 3-year-old grandson lost his life. Exactly four days later, Edgar Mahlomola Motuba, the editor of the popular newspaper [[Leselinyana la Lesotho]], was abducted from his home together with two friends and murdered.

The BNP ruled from 1966 until January 1970. What later ensued was a [[de facto]] government led by Dr. Leabua Jonathan until 1986 when a military [[coup d'état|coup]] forced it out of office. The Transitional Military Council that came to power granted executive powers to [[Moshoeshoe II of Lesotho|King Moshoeshoe II]], who was until then a [[ceremonial monarch]]. But in 1987 the King was forced into [[exile]] after coming up with a six-page memorandum on how he wanted the Lesotho's constitution to be, which would have given him more executive powers had the military government agreed. His son was installed as [[Letsie III of Lesotho|King Letsie III]].

[[File:Lesotho mountain village (5285775857).jpg|thumb|Lesotho mountain village]]
The chairman of the [[military junta]], Major General [[Justin Metsing Lekhanya]], was ousted in 1991 and replaced by Major General [[Elias Phisoana Ramaema]], who handed over power to a democratically elected government of the BCP in 1993. Moshoeshoe II returned from exile in 1992 as an ordinary citizen. After the return to democratic government, King Letsie III tried unsuccessfully to persuade the BCP government to reinstate his father (Moshoeshoe II) as [[head of state]].

In August 1994, Letsie III staged a military-backed coup that deposed the BCP government, after the BCP government refused to reinstate his father, Moshoeshoe II, according to Lesotho's constitution. The new government did not receive full international recognition. Member states of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) engaged in negotiations to reinstate the BCP government. One of the conditions Letsie III put forward for this was that his father should be re-installed as head of state. After protracted negotiations, the BCP government was reinstated and Letsie III abdicated in favour of his father in 1995, but he ascended the throne again when Moshoeshoe II died at the age of fifty-seven in a supposed road accident, when his car plunged off a mountain road during the early hours of 15 January 1996. According to a government statement, Moshoeshoe had set out at 1&nbsp;am to visit his [[cattle]] at Matsieng and was returning to [[Maseru]] through the [[Maluti Mountains]] when his car left the road.<ref name=nyt>Donald G. McNeil Jr (16 January 1996) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00E4D91139F935A25752C0A960958260 King of Tiny Land Circled by South Africa Dies in Car Plunge]. [[The New York Times]].</ref>

In 1997, the ruling BCP split over leadership disputes. [[Prime Minister]] [[Ntsu Mokhehle]] formed a new party, the [[Lesotho Congress for Democracy]] (LCD), and was followed by a majority of members of [[parliament]], which enabled him to form a new government. [[Pakalitha Mosisili]] succeeded Mokhehle as party leader and the LCD won the general elections in 1998. Although the elections were pronounced free and fair by local and international observers and a subsequent special commission appointed by SADC, the opposition political parties rejected the results.

Opposition protests in the country intensified, culminating in a peaceful demonstration outside the royal [[palace]] in August 1998. Exact details of what followed are greatly disputed, both in Lesotho and South Africa. While the [[Botswana Defence Force]] troops were welcomed, tensions with [[South African National Defence Force]] troops were high, resulting in fighting. Incidences of sporadic [[rioting]] intensified when South African troops hoisted a South African flag over the Royal Palace. By the time the SADC forces withdrew in May 1999, much of the capital of [[Maseru]] lay in ruins, and the southern provincial capital towns of [[Mafeteng]] and [[Mohale's Hoek]] had seen the loss of over a third of their commercial [[real estate]]. A number of South Africans and Basotho also died in the fighting.

An Interim Political Authority (IPA), charged with reviewing the electoral structure in the country, was created in December 1998. The IPA devised a proportional electoral system to ensure that the opposition would be represented in the [[National Assembly]]. The new system retained the existing 80 elected Assembly seats, but added 40 seats to be filled on a proportional basis. Elections were held under this new system in May 2002, and the LCD won again, gaining 54 percent of the vote. But for the first time, opposition [[political parties]] won significant numbers of seats, and despite some irregularities and threats of violence from Major General Lekhanya, Lesotho experienced its first peaceful election. Nine opposition parties now hold all 40 of the proportional seats, with the BNP having the largest share (21). The LCD has 79 of the 80 [[constituency]]-based seats. Although its elected members participate in the National Assembly, the BNP has launched several legal challenges to the elections, including a recount; none has been successful.

On 30 August 2014, an alleged abortive military "coup" took place, forcing then Prime Minister [[Thomas Thabane]] to flee to South Africa for three days.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28994193 Lesotho 'coup' forces PM Thabane to South Africa] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802202642/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-28994193# |date=2 August 2018 }}.

The Lesotho Government is a parliamentary or [[constitutional monarchy]]. The Prime Minister, [[Tom Thabane]], is [[head of government]] and has [[executive authority]]. The [[King of Lesotho]], [[Letsie III of Lesotho|Letsie III]], serves a largely ceremonial function; he no longer possesses any executive authority and is prohibited from actively participating in political initiatives.

The [[All Basotho Convention]] (ABC) leads a [[coalition government]] in the [[National Assembly of Lesotho|National Assembly]], the lower house of parliament.

The upper house of parliament, called the [[Senate of Lesotho|Senate]], is composed of 22 principal chiefs whose membership is hereditary, and 11 appointees of the king, acting on the advice of the prime minister.

The constitution provides for an independent judicial system, made up of the High Court, the Court of Appeal, Magistrate's Courts, and traditional courts that exist predominantly in rural areas. All but one of the Justices on the Court of Appeal are South African jurists. There is no trial by jury; rather, judges make rulings alone or, in the case of criminal trials, with two other judges as observers.

The constitution also protects basic [[civil liberties]], including [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of association]], [[freedom of the press]], [[freedom of assembly|freedom of peaceful assembly]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Lesotho was ranked 12th out of 48 sub-Saharan African countries in the 2008 [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]].<ref>[http://moibrahimfoundation.org "Home | Mo Ibrahim Foundation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321114046/http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/# |date=21 March 2016 }}. moibrahimfoundation.org.</ref>

Lesotho does not have a single code containing its laws; it draws them from a variety of sources including: Constitution, Legislation, Common Law, Judicial precedent, Customary Law, and Authoritative texts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/lesotho.htm |title=Millennium Web Catalog |publisher=nyulawglobal.org |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620014058/http://nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Lesotho.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010 |df= }}</ref>

[[File:Chinese Lesotho project Lesotho Parliament II.jpg|thumb|The Parliament building in Maseru]]
The Constitution of Lesotho came into force after the publication of the Commencement Order. Constitutionally, legislation refers to laws that have been passed by both houses of parliament and have been assented to by the king (section 78(1)). Subordinate legislation refers to laws passed by other bodies to which parliament has by virtue of section 70(2) of the Constitution validly delegated such legislative powers. These include government publications, ministerial orders, ministerial regulations and municipal [[by-laws]].

Although Lesotho shares with [[South Africa]], [[Botswana]], [[Swaziland]], [[Namibia]] and [[Zimbabwe]] a mixed general legal system which resulted from the interaction between the Roman-Dutch Civilian law and the [[English Common Law]], its general law operates independently. Lesotho also applies the common law, which refers to unwritten law or law from non-statutory sources, but excludes customary law. Decisions from South African courts are only persuasive, and courts refer to them in formulating their decisions. Decisions from similar jurisdictions can also be cited for their persuasive value. Magistrates' courts decisions do not become precedent since these are lower courts. They are however bound by decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. At the apex of the Lesotho justice system is the Court of Appeal, which is the final appellate forum on all matters. It has a supervisory and review jurisdiction over all the courts of Lesotho.

Lesotho has a dual legal system consisting of customary and general laws operating side by side. Customary law is made up of the customs of the Basotho, written and codified in the Laws of '''Lerotholi''' whereas general law consists of '''Roman Dutch Law''' imported from the Cape and the Lesotho statutes. The codification of customary law came about after a council was appointed in 1903 to advise the British Resident Commissioner on what was best for the [[Basotho]] in terms of laws that would govern them. Until this time, the Basotho customs and laws were passed down from generation to generation through oral tradition. The council was then given the task of codifying them, came up with the Laws of Lerotholi which are applied by customary courts today (local courts). Written works of eminent authors have persuasive value in the courts of Lesotho. These include writings of the old authorities as well as contemporary writers from similar jurisdictions.

===Districts===
[[File:Map of lesotho.png|thumb|Districts and Cities of Lesotho]]{{Main|Districts of Lesotho}}
For administrative purposes, Lesotho is divided into [[Districts of Lesotho|ten districts]], each headed by a district administrator. Each district has a capital known as a ''[[Camptown (Lesotho)|camptown]]''.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Lesotho}}
[[File:AfriSki.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Afriski]] resort in the [[Maloti Mountains]] of Lesotho]]
Lesotho covers {{convert|30355|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. It is the only independent state in the world that lies entirely above {{convert|1000|m|ft|0}} in elevation. Its lowest point of {{convert|1400|m|ft|0}} is thus the [[List of countries by lowest point|highest in the world]]. Over 80 percent of the country lies above {{convert|1800|m|ft|0}}. Lesotho is also the southernmost landlocked country in the world and is entirely surrounded by South Africa. It lies between latitudes [[28th parallel south|28°]] and [[31st parallel south|31°S]], and longitudes [[27th meridian east|27°]] and [[30th meridian east|30°E]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Lesotho}}
Because of its elevation, Lesotho remains cooler throughout the year than other regions at the same latitude. Most of the rain falls as summer [[thunderstorm]]s. [[Maseru]] and surrounding lowlands often reach {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in summer. Winters can be cold with the lowlands getting down to {{convert|-7|°C|°F|abbr=on}} and the highlands to {{convert|-18|°C|°F|abbr=on}} at times. Snow is common in the highlands between May and September; the higher peaks can experience snowfalls year-round.

Lesotho has progressed in moving from a predominantly subsistence-oriented economy to a lower middle income economy exporting natural resources and manufacturing goods. The exporting sectors have brought higher and more secure incomes to a significant portion of the population.<ref name="worldbank"/>

The global economic crisis hit the Lesotho economy hard, though: the loss of textile exports and jobs in the sector due largely to the economic slowdown in the United States which is a major export destination; reduced diamond mining and exports, including weak prices for diamonds; drop in SACU revenues due to the economic slowdown in the South African economy; and reduction in worker remittances due to weakening of the South African economy and contraction of the mining sector and related job losses in South Africa. In 2009, GDP growth slowed to 0.9 percent.<ref name="worldbank"/>

The official currency is the [[Lesotho loti|loti]] (plural: maloti), but can be used interchangeably with the [[South African rand]]. Lesotho, Swaziland, Namibia, and South Africa also form a common currency and exchange control area known as the [[Common Monetary Area]] (CMA). The loti is at par with the rand. One hundred '''lisente''' (singular: '''sente''') equal one loti.

Lesotho is a member of the [[Southern African Customs Union]] (SACU), in which tariffs have been eliminated on the trade of goods between other member countries [[Botswana]], [[Namibia]], South Africa, and [[Swaziland]]. Lesotho has received economic aid from a variety of sources, including the United States, the [[World Bank]], Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom, the [[European Union]], and Germany.

Lesotho's ethno-linguistic structure consists almost entirely of the [[Basotho]], a Bantu-speaking people: an estimated 99.7 percent of the people identify as Basotho. Basotho subgroups include the Bafokeng (''totems: '''phoka''' (dew), ''''mutla''' (hare)''), Batloung (''totem: '''tlou''' (elephant)''), Baphuthi (''totem: '''phuthi'''''), Bakuena (''totem: '''kuena''' (crocodile)''), Bataung (''totem: '''tau''' (lion)''), Batšoeneng (''totem: '''tšoene'''''), and [[Matebele]].

The main language, [[Sesotho]], is also the first official and administrative language, and it is what Basotho speak on an ordinary basis.

The internal and external security of Lesotho is the responsibility of the Defence Commission, which is established and defined by article 145 of the Lesotho national Constitution. The Prime Minister is the Chairman ''ex officio'', and there are six other Defence Commission members, namely the Commander and Deputy Commander of the Lesotho Defence Force, the Commissioner and Assistant Commissioner of the Lesotho Mounted Police Service, and the Director and Deputy Director of the Lesotho National Security Service. The Defence Commission has power to strategically direct the defence force, the police, and the prison service, but not the security service, which is answerable only to the Government. The Defence Commission has power to appoint or remove the senior staff of the defence force, police, and prison service, but not the security service, whose Director and Deputy Director are personal appointments of the Prime Minister.<ref>See article 145 of the [http://library2.parliament.go.th/giventake/content_cons/lesotho.pdf Constitution of Lesotho] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182858/http://library2.parliament.go.th/giventake/content_cons/lesotho.pdf |date= 3 March 2016 }}.</ref>

The [[Lesotho Defence Force]] (LDF) is established under article 146 of the national Constitution, and charged with the maintenance of internal security and the defence of Lesotho. Its chief officer is designated ''Commander'' by the Constitution, and usually holds the rank of [[lieutenant-general]]. The LDF has a total strength of just over 3,000. The largest component is infantry, but they are supported by small artillery, logistics, and air force units, and a single [[armoured reconnaissance]] [[Company (military unit)|company]]. Since 2000, Lesotho Defence Forces have been trained by a small contingent of Indian Army Training Team, led by a Brigadier.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The [[Lesotho Mounted Police Service]] (LMPS) is established under article 147 of the national Constitution, and charged with the maintenance of law and order. Its chief officer is designated ''Commissioner'' by the Constitution. The LMPS provides uniformed policing, criminal detection, and traffic policing. There are specialist units dealing with high-tech crime, immigration, wildlife, and terrorism. The current force has existed, despite changes of name, continuously since 1872.

The [[Lesotho National Security Service]] (LNSS) is established under article 148 of the national Constitution, and charged with the protection of national security. Its chief officer is designated ''Director'' by the Constitution. The LNSS is an intelligence service, reporting directly to the Government. The power to appoint or dismiss a Director is vested directly in the Prime Minister.

Traditional musical instruments include '''''lekolulo''''', a kind of flute used by herding boys, '''''setolo-tolo''''', played by men using their mouth, and the woman's stringed '''''thomo'''''.

The national anthem of Lesotho is "''Lesotho Fatše La Bo-ntata Rona''", which literally translates into "Lesotho, Land of Our Fore-Fathers".

The traditional style of housing in Lesotho is called a mokhoro. Many older houses, especially in smaller towns and villages, are of this type, with walls usually constructed from large stones cemented together. Baked mud bricks and especially [[concrete masonry unit|concrete blocks]] are also used nowadays, with thatched roofs still common, although often replaced by corrugated roofing sheets.

Traditional attire revolves around the [[Basotho blanket]], a thick covering made primarily of wool. The blankets are ubiquitous throughout the country during all seasons, and worn differently by men and women.

The [[Morija Arts & Cultural Festival]] is a prominent Sesotho arts and music festival. It is held annually in the historical town of Morija, where the first missionaries arrived in 1833.

===Cuisine===
The [[cuisine of Lesotho]] includes African traditions and British influences.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foodspring.com/content/lesotho/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217042157/http://foodspring.com/content/lesotho/ |archivedate=17 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
The national dish of Lesotho is Motoho, a fermented sorghum porridge eaten throughout the country.

====Traditional food====
Because Lesotho has limited food resources, a majority of families in the country raise their own food and [[livestock]] to support themselves and their families.

Some staple foods include [[Pap (food)|pap-pap]], a [[cornmeal]] [[porridge]] covered with a sauce consisting of various vegetables. [[Tea]] and locally brewed [[beer]] are popular choices for beverages.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ethnic Food of Lesotho|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/ethnic-food-lesotho-36010.html|website=USA Today|accessdate=1 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310081024/http://traveltips.usatoday.com/ethnic-food-lesotho-36010.html#|archive-date=10 March 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== In popular media ===
2018 film ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' director [[Ryan Coogler]] stated that his depiction of Wakanda was inspired by Lesotho.<ref>https://www.timeslive.co.za/sunday-times/lifestyle/2018-02-17-black-panther-director-ryan-cooglers-a-fan-of-lesotho--isixhosa/</ref><ref>https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/black-panthers-wakanda-explained.html</ref> Basotho blankets also became more known as a result of the film.<ref>https://www.businessinsider.co.za/black-panther-has-not-real-effect-on-the-south-african-sale-of-basotho-blankts-2018-3</ref>

==Social issues==
Significant levels of [[child labour]] exist in Lesotho, and the country is in the process of formulating an Action Program on the Elimination of Child Labor (APEC). According to the UN, Lesotho has the highest rape rate of any country (91.6 per 100,000 people rate for reported rape in 2008).<ref>[http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/cri_rap_rat-crime-rape-rate "Countries Compared by Crime > Rape rate.

Treatment of people with [[disability|disabilities]] is another major issue facing the country. According to the Lesotho Census 2006 around four percent of the population is thought to have some sort of disability. However, there are concerns regarding the reliability of the methodologies used and the real figure is thought to be closer to the global estimate of 15 percent. According to a survey conducted by the Lesotho National Federation of Organisations of the Disabled in conjunction with SINTEF,<ref>Yusman Kamaleri and Arne H. Eide (eds.) (2011) [http://www.lnfod.org.ls/uploads/1/2/2/5/12251792/report_lesotho_3101111.pdf Living Conditions of People with Disability in Lesotho] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402154124/http://www.lnfod.org.ls/uploads/1/2/2/5/12251792/report_lesotho_3101111.pdf# |date=2 April 2015 }}. SINTEF Technology and Society. lnfod.org.ls</ref> people with disability in Lesotho face significant social and cultural barriers which prevent them from accessing education, healthcare, and employment on an equal basis with others.

On 2 December 2008 Lesotho became the 42nd country in the world to sign the UN [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]. However, to date the treaty has yet to be domesticated. Despite lobbying efforts from disabled persons organisations, there have been no moves to develop disability specific legislation to protect the [[disability rights|rights of people with disabilities]]. Although the National Disability and Rehabilitation Policy was developed in 2011, as yet there has been no budget allocated for its implementation.

[[Sexual violence]] in Lesotho is a serious problem. International data from [[UNODC]] found the incidence of rapes recorded in 2008 by the police to be the highest in Lesotho.<ref name="unodc1">[http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls "Rape at the National Level, number of police recorded offenses".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210321/http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls# |date=29 October 2013 }} [[United Nations]].</ref>

One study in Lesotho found that 61 percent of women reported having experienced sexual violence at some point in their lives, of which 22 percent reported being physically forced to have sexual intercourse.<ref>[https://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_114115.htm "Magnitude of sexual violence in Lesotho"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201559/https://apha.confex.com/apha/133am/techprogram/paper_114115.htm# |date=29 October 2013 }}. confex.com.</ref> In the 2009 [[Demographic and Health Surveys|DHS survey]] 15.7 percent of men said that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife if she refuses to have sex with him, while 16 percent said a husband is justified to use force to have sex.<ref>[http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR241/FR241%5BNEW_completeHHQst_3March2012%5D.pdf Lesotho.

The ''Married Persons Equality Act 2006'' gives equal rights to wives in regard to their husbands, abolishing the husband's [[marital power]].<ref>Buhle Angelo Dube.

The [https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-gender-gap-report-2015/ World Economic Forum's 2015 Gender Gap Report] ranks Lesotho 61st in the world for gender parity, while neighboring South Africa ranks 17th.<ref>[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GGGR2015/cover.pdf The Global Gender Gap Report 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025104805/http://www3.weforum.org/docs/GGGR2015/cover.pdf# |date=25 October 2016 }}.

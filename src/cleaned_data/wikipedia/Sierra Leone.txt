Sierra Leone was a [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|British Crown Colony]] from [[1808]] to [[1961]]. Sierra Leone became independent from the [[United Kingdom]] on 27 April 1961, led by Sir [[Milton Margai]], who became the country's first [[Prime Minister of Sierra Leone|prime minister]]. In May 1962, Sierra Leone held its first general elections as an independent nation. On 19 April 1971, [[Siaka Stevens]]' government abolished Sierra Leone's [[parliamentary government]] system and declared Sierra Leone a [[presidential republic]]. From 1978 to 1985, Sierra Leone was a one-party state in which Stevens' APC was the only legal  political party in the country. The current [[constitution of Sierra Leone]], which includes multiparty democracy, was adopted in 1991 by the government of President [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], Stevens' hand-picked successor. On 23 March 1991, a rebel group known as the [[Revolutionary United Front]] led by a former Sierra Leone army officer [[Foday Sankoh]] launched an eleven-year brutal civil war in the country, in an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Sierra Leone government.

In April 1992, a group of junior army officers in their twenties overthrew president Momoh from power, and their leader a 25 year old captain [[Valentine Strasser]] became the world's youngest Head of State. In January 1996 [[Brigadier General]] [[Julius Maada Bio]] returned the country to multi-party democracy and the 1991 constitution was reestablished. Bio handed power to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] after his victory in the 1996 Sierra Leone presidential election. In 1997, the military overthrew President Kabbah. However, in February 1998, a coalition of West African [[Ecowas]] armed forces led by [[Nigeria]] removed the [[military junta]] from power by force and President Kabbah was reinstated as president. Sierra Leone has had an uninterrupted democracy from 1998 to present. In January 2002, President [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]] fulfilled his campaign promise by officially ending the civil war as the rebels were defeated by military force with the help and support of Ecowas, the British government, the [[African Union]], and the [[United Nations]].

[[Ethnic groups in Sierra Leone|16 ethnic groups]] inhabit Sierra Leone, each with its own language and customs. The two largest and most influential are the [[Temne people|Temne]] and [[Mende people|Mende]]. The Temne are predominantly found in the northwest of the country, and the Mende are predominant in the southeast. Comprising a small minority, about 2%, are the [[Krio people]], who are descendants of freed [[African-American]] and [[West Indian]] [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]].  Although [[English language|English]] is the [[official language]], used in schools and government administration, [[Krio language|Krio]], an [[English-based creole]], is the most widely spoken language across Sierra Leone and is spoken by 98% of the country's population. The Krio language unites all the different ethnic groups in the country, especially in their trade and social interaction.

Sierra Leone is a [[Islam|Muslim]]-majority country at about 78%, though there is an influential [[Christianity|Christian]] minority at 21%.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title = The World Factbook|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sl.html|website = www.cia.gov|access-date = 7 October 2015}}</ref> Sierra Leone is regarded as one of the most religiously tolerant states in the world. [[Muslims]] and [[Christians]] collaborate and interact with each other very peacefully, and [[religious violence]] is very rare. The major Christian and Muslim holidays are officially [[Public holidays in Sierra Leone|public holidays in the country]], including [[Christmas]], [[Easter]], [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]]

Sierra Leone has relied on mining, especially [[diamond]]s, for its economic base. It is also among the largest producers of [[titanium]] and [[bauxite]], is a major producer of [[gold]], and has one of the world's largest deposits of [[rutile]]. Sierra Leone is home to the third-largest natural harbour in the world. Despite this natural wealth, 53% of its population lived in poverty in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=sl&v=69|title=Sierra Leone Population below poverty line (%) |publisher=Indexmundi.com |date=30 June 2015 |access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref> Sierra Leone is a member of many international organisations, including the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS), the [[Mano River Union]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[African Development Bank]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].

Sierra Leone's dense tropical rainforest and swampy environment was considered impenetrable; it was also host to the [[tsetse fly]], which carried a disease fatal to horses and the [[zebu]] cattle used by the [[Mande people]]. This environmental factor protected its people from conquests by the Mande and other African empires.<ref name="brooks">[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=2789148 Christopher Fyfe, "Weighing the Probabilities"], Review: ''Landlords and Strangers: Ecology, Society and Trade in Western Africa, 1000–1630'', By George E.

===European trading===
European contacts within Sierra Leone were among the first in [[West Africa]] in the 15th century. In 1462, [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorer]] [[Pedro de Sintra]] mapped the hills surrounding what is now Freetown Harbour, naming the shaped formation ''Serra da Leoa'' or "Serra Leoa" ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for [[Lioness Mountains]]).<ref name="ReferenceA">''Kingfisher Geography encyclopedia''. {{ISBN|1-85613-582-9}}. p. 180</ref> The Spanish rendering of this geographic formation is ''Sierra Leona'', which later was adapted and, misspelled, became the country's current name. Although according to the [[professor]] C. Magbaily Fyle this could have been a misinterpretation of historians: according to him, there has been evidence of travellers calling the region ''Serra Lyoa'' well before 1462, the year when Sintra first arrived. This would imply that the identity of the person who named Sierra Leone still remains unclear.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://slconcordtimes.com/pedro-da-cintra-did-not-name-sierra-leone-an-exploration-into-available-evidence/ |title=Pedro da çintra did not name Sierra Leone: An Exploration into available evidence |last= |first= |date=22 June 2017 |website= |publisher=Sierra Leone Concord Times |access-date=26 May 2017 |quote=}}</ref>

Soon after Sintra's expedition, Portuguese traders arrived at the harbour. By 1495 they had built a fortified [[trading post]] on the coast.<ref name="LeVert">{{Cite book |last =LeVert |first =Suzanne |title =Cultures of the World: Sierra Leone |page=22|publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn =978-0-7614-2334-8 |year =2006}}</ref> The [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] and [[Kingdom of France|French]] also set up trade here, and each nation used Sierra Leone as a trading point for [[slave]]s brought by African traders from interior areas undergoing tribal wars and conflicts over territory.<ref name="Sibthorpe">{{Cite book |last =Sibthorpe |first =A.

=== Early colonies ===
Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], the British evacuated thousands of freed [[African-American]] slaves and resettled them in Canadian and Caribbean colonies and London, which gave them new lives. In 1787 the British Crown founded a settlement in Sierra Leone in what was called the "[[Province of Freedom]]". It intended to resettle some of the "Black Poor of London", mostly African-Americans freed by the British during the war. About 400 blacks and 60 whites reached Sierra Leone on 15 May 1787. The group also included some [[West Indies|West Indians]] of African descent from London. After they established [[Granville Town]], most of the first group of colonists died, owing to disease and warfare with the indigenous African peoples ([[Temne people|Temne]]), who resisted their encroachment. The 64&nbsp;remaining colonists established a second Granville Town.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Pham |first = John-Peter |title = Child Soldiers, Adult Interests: The Global Dimensions of the Sierra Leonean Tragedy |publisher = Nova Publishers |year = 2005 |pages = 4–8 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZnPFKpwoIkIC&pg=PA4 |isbn = 978-1-59454-671-6 |accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>Michael Sivapragasam, ''Why Did Black Londoners not join the Sierra Leone Resettlement Scheme 1783–1815?'' (London: Open University, 2013).</ref>

Following the Revolution, more than 3,000 [[Black Loyalists]] had also been settled in [[Nova Scotia]], where they were finally granted land. They founded [[Birchtown, Nova Scotia]], but faced harsh winters and racial discrimination from nearby [[Shelburne, Nova Scotia]]. [[Thomas Peters (black leader)|Thomas Peters]] pressed British authorities for relief and more aid; together with British abolitionist [[John Clarkson (abolitionist)|John Clarkson]], the [[Sierra Leone Company]] was established to relocate Black Loyalists who wanted to take their chances in West Africa. In 1792 nearly 1200&nbsp;persons from Nova Scotia crossed the Atlantic to build the second (and only permanent) Colony of Sierra Leone and the settlement of [[Freetown]] on 11 March 1792. In Sierra Leone they were called the [[Nova Scotian Settlers (Sierra Leone)|''Nova Scotian Settlers'']], the ''Nova Scotians'', or the ''Settlers''.

The Settlers built Freetown in the styles they knew from their lives in the [[American South]]; they also continued American fashion and American manners. In addition, many continued to practice [[Methodism]] in Freetown. Black settlers in Sierra Leone enjoyed much more autonomy in that they were more politically engaged. Black immigrants elected different levels of political representatives, 'tithingmen', who represented each dozen settlers, and 'hundreders' who represented larger amounts. This sort of representation was not available in Nova Scotia.<ref>Gilbert, Alan. ''Black Patriots and Loyalists: Fighting for Emancipation in the War for Independence''. University of Chicago 2012, p. 229</ref> The initial process of society-building in Freetown, however, was a harsh struggle. The Crown did not supply enough basic supplies and provisions, and the Settlers were continually threatened by illegal slave trading and the risk of re-enslavement.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Fyfe |first = Christopher |title = Our Children Free and Happy: Letters from Black Settlers in Africa in the 1790s|publisher = Edinburgh University Press |year = 1992}}</ref> In the 1790s, the Settlers, including adult women, voted for the first time in elections.<ref name=economist>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12775514 |title=Sierra Leone's struggle for progress |work=The Economist |date= 11 December 2008|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref> The Sierra Leone Company, controlled by London investors, refused to allow the settlers to take [[fee simple|freehold]] of the land. In 1799 some of the settlers revolted. The Crown subdued the revolt by bringing in forces of more than 500&nbsp;[[Jamaican Maroons]], whom they transported from [[Cudjoe's Town (Trelawny Town)]] via Nova Scotia in 1800. Led by Colonel Montague James, the Maroons helped the colonial forces to put down the revolt, and in the process they secured the best houses and farms.<ref>Simon Schama, ''Rough Crossings'' (London: 2005), pp. 380–383.</ref>

On 1 January 1808, [[Thomas Ludlam (colonialist)|Thomas Ludlam]], the Governor of the Sierra Leone Company and a leading abolitionist, surrendered the Company's charter. This ended its 16&nbsp;years of running the Colony. The British Crown reorganised the Sierra Leone Company as the [[African Institution]]; it was directed to improve the local economy. Its members represented both British who hoped to inspire local entrepreneurs and those with interest in the Macauley & Babington Company, which held the (British) [[monopoly]] on Sierra Leone trade.<ref>Harris, Sheldon H. (1972): ''Paul Cuffe: Black America and the African Return'', New York: Simon and Schuster, pp. 32–33, especially note 15 on p. 140.</ref>

At about the same time (following the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|abolition of the slave trade in 1807]]), British crews delivered thousands of formerly enslaved Africans to Freetown, after liberating them from illegal slave ships. These Liberated Africans or ''[[recaptives]]'' were sold for $20 a head as apprentices to the white settlers, Nova Scotian Settlers, and the Jamaican Maroons.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Some of the recaptives who were not sold as apprentices were forced to join the Navy. Many recaptives were treated poorly and even abused because some of the original settlers considered them their property. Cut off from their various homelands and traditions, the Liberated Africans were forced to assimilate to the Western styles of Settlers and Maroons. For example, some of the recaptives were forced to change their name to a more Western sounding one. Though some people happily embraced these changes because they considered it as being part of the community, some were not happy with these changes and wanted to keep their own identity. Many recaptives were so unhappy that they risked the possibility of being sold back into slavery by leaving Sierra Leone and going back to their original villages.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=Suzanne|date=5 January 2013|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Enslaved Africans: Sierra Leone, c. 1808–19|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267884583}}</ref> They built a flourishing trade in flowers and beads on the West African coast.

These returned Africans were from many areas of Africa, but principally the west coast. During the 19th century, freed black Americans, some [[Americo Liberian]] 'refugees', and particularly West Indians, also immigrated and settled in Freetown. Together these peoples created a new creole ethnicity called the [[Krio people]] (initially called Creoles) and a trading language, [[Krio language|Krio]], which became commonly used among many of the ethnicities in the country.

=== Colonial era (1800–1960) ===
{{Main|Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate}}
The settlement of Sierra Leone in the 1800s was unique in that the population was composed of displaced Africans who were brought to the colony after the Spanish abolition of the slave trade in 1807. Upon arrival in Sierra Leone, each "recaptive" was given a registration number, and information on their physical qualities would be entered into the Register of Liberated Africans. However, oftentimes the documentation would be overwhelmingly subjective and would result in inaccurate entries, making them difficult to track. In addition, differences between the Register of Liberated Africans of 1808 and the List of Captured Negroes of 1812 (which emulated the 1808 document) revealed some disparities in the entries of the recaptives, specifically in the names; many recaptives decided to change their given names to more [[anglicised]] versions which contributed to the difficulty in tracking them after they arrived in Sierra Leone.

According to the British Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in 1807, the recaptives could be subject to apprenticeships led by British colonists in Sierra Leone and the males enlisted into the Army or Navy. In many instances, the recaptives who were assigned to apprenticeships were sold for $20, giving the apprenticeship system qualities similar to slavery.<ref name="Schwartz 2012">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Suzanne|date=2012|title=Reconstructing the Life Histories of Liberated Africans: Sierra Leone in the Early Nineteenth Century|url=|journal=History in Africa|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}</ref> It is documented that the recaptive apprentices were unpaid and the settlers who they were appointed to had devices which could be used to discipline them, namely sticks. According to Suzanne Schwartz, a historian on colonial Sierra Leone, in June 1808 a group of 21 men and women ran away to the nearby native settlement of Robiss and upon recapture were imprisoned by the settlers in Sierra Leone, thus contributing to the slavery-like qualities of the apprenticeship system.<ref name="Schwartz 2012"/> [[File:Bai Bureh.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bai Bureh]], Temne leader of the [[Hut Tax War of 1898]] against British rule]]

In the early 19th century, Freetown served as the residence of the British colonial governor of the region, who also administered the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]) and the [[Gambia]] settlements. Sierra Leone developed as the educational centre of British West Africa. The British established [[Fourah Bay College]] here in 1827, which rapidly became a magnet for English-speaking Africans on the West Coast. For more than a century, it was the only European-style university in western [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

The British interacted mostly with the Krios in Freetown, who did most of the trading with the indigenous peoples of the interior. In addition, educated Krios held numerous positions in the colonial government, giving them status and good-paying positions. Following the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884–1885, the UK decided that it needed to establish more dominion over the inland areas, to satisfy what was described by the European powers as "effective occupation" of territories. In 1896 it annexed these areas, declaring them the Sierra Leone Protectorate.<ref name="harris40">Harris, David (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=B5RxmwC6aNwC&pg=PA1 ''Civil War and Democracy in West Africa: Conflict Resolution, Elections and Justice in Sierra Leone and Liberia''], I.B. Tauris. p. 40</ref> With this change, the British began to expand their administration in the region, recruiting British citizens to posts, and pushing Krios out of positions in government and even the desirable residential areas in Freetown.<ref name="harris40"/>

In addition, the British annexation of the Protectorate interfered with the sovereignty of indigenous chiefs. They designated chiefs as units of local government, rather than dealing with them individually as had been previous practice. They did not maintain relationships even with longtime allies, such as [[Bai Bureh]], chief of Kasseh, a community on the Small Scarcies River. He was later unfairly portrayed as a prime instigator of the Hut Tax war in 1898.<ref name="abraham">{{cite journal

Colonel Frederic Cardew, military governor of the Protectorate, in 1898 established a new tax on dwellings and demanded that the chiefs use their peoples to maintain roads. The taxes were often higher than the value of the dwellings, and 24 chiefs signed a petition to Cardew, stating how destructive this was; their people could not afford to take time off from their subsistence agriculture. They resisted payment of taxes. Tensions over the new colonial requirements, and the administration's suspicions about the chiefs led to the [[Hut Tax War of 1898|Hut Tax war of 1898]], also called the Temne-Mende War. The British fired first. The Northern front of majority Temne people was led by [[Bai Bureh]]. The Southern front, consisting mostly of [[Mende people]], entered conflict somewhat later and for different reasons.

For several months, Bureh's fighters had the advantage over the vastly more powerful British forces, but the British troops and Bureh's warriors suffered hundreds of fatalities.<ref>[http://www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes5.html History], Sierra-leone.org, Retrieved 17 January 2007.</ref> Bai Bureh finally surrendered on 11 November 1898 to end the destruction of his people's territory and dwellings. Although the British government recommended leniency, Cardew insisted on sending the chief and two allies into [[exile]] in the Gold Coast;<ref name="abraham"/> his government hanged 96 of the chief's warriors. Bai Bureh was allowed to return in 1905, when he resumed his chieftaincy of Kasseh.<ref name="abraham"/>

The defeat of the Temne and Mende in the Hut Tax war ended mass resistance to the Protectorate and colonial government, but intermittent rioting and labour unrest continued throughout the colonial period. Riots in 1955 and 1956 involved "many tens of thousands" of Sierra Leonians in the protectorate.<ref>Killson, Martin (1966) ''Political Change in a West African State: A Study of the Modernization Process in Sierra Leone'', Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, pp. 60; also pp. 106, 107, 110, 111, 186–188 on other riots and strikes.</ref>

Domestic [[Slavery in Africa|slavery]], which continued to be practised by local African elites, was abolished in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmintdev/923/923m21.htm |title=House of Commons – International Development – Memoranda |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> A notable event in 1935 was the granting of a monopoly on mineral mining to the [[Sierra Leone Selection Trust]], run by [[De Beers]]. The monopoly was scheduled to last 98 years. Mining of diamonds in the east and other minerals expanded, drawing labourers there from other parts of the country.

In 1924, the UK government divided Sierra Leone into a Colony and a Protectorate, with different political systems constitutionally defined for each. The Colony was Freetown and its coastal area; the Protectorate was defined as the hinterland areas dominated by local chiefs. Antagonism between the two entities escalated to a heated debate in 1947, when proposals were introduced to provide for a single political system for both the Colony and the Protectorate. Most of the proposals came from leaders of the Protectorate, whose population far outnumbered that in the colony. The Krios, led by [[I. T. A. Wallace-Johnson|Isaac Wallace-Johnson]], opposed the proposals, as they would have resulted in reducing the political power of the Krios in the Colony.

In 1951, educated protectorate leaders from different groups, including [[Sir]] [[Milton Margai]], [[Lamina Sankoh]], [[Siaka Stevens]], Mohamed Sanusi Mustapha, [[John Karefa-Smart]], Kande Bureh, Sir [[Albert Margai]], [[Amadu Wurie]] and Sir [[Banja Tejan-Sie]] joined together with the powerful [[paramount chiefs]] in the protectorate to form the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] or SLPP as the party of the protectorate. The SLPP leadership, led by Sir Milton Margai, negotiated with the British and the educated Krio-dominated colony based in Freetown to achieve independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes8.html|title=Sierra Leone Web - Sierra Leonean Heroes - Achievement of Independence|website=www.sierra-leone.org}}</ref>

Owing to the astute politics of Milton Margai of the [[Mende people|Mende]], the educated Protectorate elite was won over to join forces with the [[paramount chiefs]] in the face of Krio intransigence. Later, Margai used the same skills to win over opposition leaders and moderate Krio elements to achieve independence from the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newafricanmagazine.com/special-reports/country-reports/sierra-leone-a-nation-reborn/how-independence-was-won |title=How Independence Was Won |publisher=Newafricanmagazine.com |accessdate=19 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029212925/http://www.newafricanmagazine.com/special-reports/country-reports/sierra-leone-a-nation-reborn/how-independence-was-won |archivedate=29 October 2013  }}</ref> In November 1951, Margai oversaw the drafting of a new constitution, which united the separate Colonial and Protectorate legislatures and provided a framework for [[decolonisation]].<ref name="advocate">[http://www.advocatenations.org/html/sierra_leone.html Advocate Nations of Africa: Sierra Leone] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205062710/http://www.advocatenations.org/html/sierra_leone.html |date=5 December 2014 }}</ref> In 1953, Sierra Leone was granted local ministerial powers and Margai was elected [[Chief Minister]] of Sierra Leone.<ref name="advocate"/> The new constitution ensured Sierra Leone a parliamentary system within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref name="advocate"/> In May 1957, Sierra Leone held its first parliamentary election.

=== 1960 Independence Conference ===

=== Independence (1961) and Margai Administration (1961–1964) ===
On 27 April 1961, Sir Milton Margai led Sierra Leone to independence from Great Britain and became the country's first Prime Minister. Thousands of Sierra Leoneans took to the streets in celebration. The republic retained a parliamentary system of government and was a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. The leader of the main opposition [[All People's Congress]] (APC), Siaka Stevens, along with Isaac Wallace-Johnson, another outspoken critic of the SLPP government, were arrested and placed under [[house arrest]] in Freetown, along with sixteen others charged with disrupting the independence celebration.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/27/newsid_2502000/2502411.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 27 &#124; 1961: Sierra Leone wins independence |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=20 May 2012 |date=27 April 1961}}</ref>

In May 1962, Sierra Leone held its [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1962|first general election]] as an independent nation. The [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP) won a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of seats in parliament, and Milton Margai was re-elected as prime minister.

Margai was very popular among Sierra Leoneans during his time in power, most known for his self-effacement. He was neither corrupt nor did he make a lavish display of his power or status.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sierra-leone.org/Heroes/heroes8.html|title=Sierra Leone Web - Sierra Leonean Heroes - Achievement of Independence|website=www.sierra-leone.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}</ref> He based the government on the [[rule of law]] and the separation of powers, with multiparty political institutions and fairly viable representative structures. Margai used his conservative ideology to lead Sierra Leone without much strife. He appointed government officials to represent various ethnic groups. Margai employed a brokerage style of politics, by sharing political power among political parties and interest groups; and with the powerful paramount chiefs in the provinces, most of whom were key allies of his government.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Final years of democracy (1964–1967)===
Upon Milton Margai's unexpected death in 1964, his [[half-brother]], Sir [[Albert Margai]], was appointed as Prime Minister by parliament. Sir Albert's leadership was briefly challenged by Foreign Minister [[John Karefa-Smart]], who questioned Sir Albert's succession to the SLPP leadership position. Karefa-Smart led a prominent small minority faction within the SLPP party in opposition of Albert Margai as Prime Minister. However, Kareefa-Smart failed to receive strong support within the SLPP and the SLPP dominated members of parliament in his attempt to have Albert Margai stripped of his position as the leader of the SLPP and prime minister of the country. The large majority of SLPP members backed Albert Margai over Kareefa-Smart. Soon after Albert Margai was sworn in as Prime Minister, he dismissed several senior government officials who had served under his elder brother Milton's government, viewing them as a threat to his administration, including Kareefa-Smart.

Sir Albert resorted to increasingly [[authoritarian]] actions in response to protests and enacted several laws against the opposition [[All People's Congress]] (APC), whilst attempting to establish a [[one-party state]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Sir Albert was opposed to the colonial legacy of allowing executive powers to the Paramount Chiefs, many of whom had been key allies of his late brother Sir Milton. Accordingly, they began to consider Sir Albert a threat to the ruling houses across the country. Margai appointed many non-Creoles to the country's [[civil service]] in [[Freetown]], in an overall diversification of the civil service in the capital, which had been dominated by members of the Creole ethnic group. As a result, Albert Margai became unpopular in the Creole community, many of whom had supported Sir Milton. Margai was accused of favoring members of his own Mende ethnic group for prominent positions.

In 1967, riots broke out in Freetown against Margai's policies; in response he declared a [[state of emergency]] across the country. Sir Albert was accused of corruption and of a policy of [[affirmative action]] in favor of his own [[Mende people|Mende]] ethnic group.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Pham |first = John-Peter |title = Child soldiers, adult interests: the global dimensions of the Sierra Leonean tragedy |publisher = Nova Publishers |year = 2005 |pages = 33–35 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=ZnPFKpwoIkIC&pg=PA32 |isbn = 978-1-59454-671-6 |accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref> Although possessing the full backing of the country's security forces, he called for free and fair elections.

=== Military coups (1967–1968) ===
The APC, with its leader [[Siaka Stevens]], narrowly won a small majority of seats in Parliament over the SLPP in a closely contested [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1967|1967 general election]]. Stevens was sworn in as Prime Minister on 21 March 1967.

Within hours after taking office, Stevens was ousted in a bloodless [[military coup]] led by [[Brigadier General]] [[David Lansana]], the commander of the [[Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces|Sierra Leone Armed Forces]]. He was a close ally of Albert Margai, who had appointed him to the position in 1964. Lansana placed Stevens under [[house arrest]] in Freetown and insisted that the determination of Prime Minister should await the election of the tribal representatives to the House. Upon his release, Stevens went into exile in [[Guinea]].

On 23 March 1967, a group of military officers in the Sierra Leone Army led by Brigadier General [[Andrew Juxon-Smith]], overrode this action by a coup d'état; they seized control of the government, arresting Lansana, and suspending the constitution. The group set up the [[National Reformation Council]] (NRC), with Andrew Juxon-Smith as its chairman and Head of State of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrover.com/history/sierra_leone_history.html |title=History of Sierra Leone |publisher=Worldrover.com |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>

On 18 April 1968 a group of low ranking soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army who called themselves the [[Anti-Corruption Revolutionary Movement]] (ACRM), led by Brigadier General [[John Amadu Bangura]], [[Sergeants' Coup (Sierra Leone)|overthrew]] the NRC [[Military junta|junta]]. The ACRM junta arrested many senior NRC members. They reinstated the constitution and returned power to Stevens, who at last assumed the office of Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite book |last = Gberie|first =Lansana |title = A dirty war in West Africa: the RUF and the destruction of Sierra Leone |publisher =C.

=== One-party state (1968–1991) ===
[[File:All People's Congress political rally Sierra Leone 1968.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An [[All People's Congress|APC]] political rally in the northern town of [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]] outside the home of supporters of the rival [[Sierra Leone People's Party|SLPP]] in 1968]]

Stevens assumed power again in 1968 with a great deal of hope and ambition.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Much trust was placed upon him as he championed multi-party politics. Stevens had campaigned on a platform of bringing the tribes together under [[socialist]] principles. During his first decade or so in power, Stevens renegotiated some of what he called "useless prefinanced schemes" contracted by his predecessors, both Albert Margai of the SLPP and Juxon-Smith of the NRC. Some of these policies by the SLPP and the NRC were said to have left the country in an economically deprived state.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Stevens reorganised the country's oil refinery, the government-owned Cape Sierra Hotel, and a cement factory.<ref>David Harris. Sierra Leone: A Political History., pp. 67-70 New York: Oxford University Press, 2014. {{ISBN|9780199361762}}. $30.00</ref> He cancelled Juxon-Smith's construction of a church and mosque on the grounds of Victoria Park (since mid 2017 ''Freetown Amusement Park''). Stevens began efforts that would later bridge the distance between the provinces and the city. Roads and hospitals were constructed in the provinces, and Paramount Chiefs and provincial peoples became a prominent force in Freetown.

Under pressure of several coup attempts, real or perceived, Stevens' rule grew more and more [[authoritarian]], and his relationship with some of his ardent supporters deteriorated. He removed the SLPP party from competitive politics in general elections, some believed, through the use of violence and intimidation. To maintain the support of the military, Stevens retained the popular John Amadu Bangura as the head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces.

After the return to civilian rule, by-elections were held (beginning in autumn 1968) and an all-APC cabinet was appointed. Calm was not completely restored. In November 1968, unrest in the provinces led Stevens to declare a state of emergency across the country. Many senior officers in the Sierra Leone Army were greatly disappointed with Stevens' policies and his handling of the Sierra Leone Military, but none could confront Stevens. Brigadier General Bangura, who had reinstated Stevens as Prime Minister, was widely considered the only person who could control Stevens. The army was devoted to Bangura, and this made him potentially dangerous to Stevens. In January 1970, Bangura was arrested and charged with [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and plotting to commit a coup against the Stevens government. After a trial that lasted a few months, Bangura was [[convicted]] and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. On 29 March 1970, Brigadier Bangura was executed by hanging in Freetown.

After the execution of Bangura, a group of soldiers loyal to the executed Brigadier Bangura held a [[mutiny]] in the capital Freetown and in some other parts of the country in opposition of Stevens' government. Dozens of soldiers were arrested and [[convicted]] by a [[court martial]] in Freetown for their participation in the mutiny against president Stevens. Among the soldiers arrested was a little known army [[Corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh]], a strong supporter of Bangura. Corporal Sankoh was convicted and jailed for seven years at the Pademba Road Prison in Freetown.

In April 1971, a new republican constitution was adopted under which Stevens became president. In the 1972 by-elections the opposition SLPP complained of intimidation and procedural obstruction by the APC and militia. These problems became so severe that the SLPP boycotted the [[Sierra Leonean general election, 1973|1973 general election]]; as a result the APC won 84 of the 85 elected seats.<ref>{{Cite book |last =Rotberg |first =Robert I. |title =State failure and state weakness in a time of terror |publisher = Brookings Institution Press|year =2003 |page = 80 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=oajfCpTpgCIC&pg=PA80|isbn = 978-0-8157-7574-4|accessdate = 17 June 2014}}</ref>

An alleged plot to overthrow president Stevens failed in 1974 and its leaders were executed. In mid 1974, Guinean soldiers, requested by Stevens, were in the country to help maintain his hold on power as Stevens was a close ally of then Guinean president [[Ahmed Sekou Toure]]. In March 1976, Stevens was elected without opposition for a second five-year term as president. On 19 July 1975, 14 senior army and government officials including David Lansana, former cabinet minister Mohamed Sorie Forna (father of writer [[Aminatta Forna]]), Brigadier General Ibrahim Bash Taqi and Lieutenant Habib Lansana Kamara were executed after being convicted of allegedly attempting a coup to topple president Stevens' government.

In 1977, a nationwide student demonstration against the government disrupted Sierra Leone politics. The demonstration was quickly put down by the army and Stevens' own personal Special Security Division (SSD) force, a heavily armed paramilitary force he had created to protect him and to maintain his hold on power.<ref>[http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/1669 Politicized security forces or tribalized national politics; which is which?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901024455/http://www.newstimeafrica.com/archives/1669 |date=1 September 2012 }}. Newstime Africa. Retrieved on 26 February 2013.</ref> The SSD officers were very loyal to Stevens and were deployed across Sierra Leone to put down any rebellion or protest against Stevens' government. [[Sierra Leonean parliamentary election, 1977|A general election]] was called later that year in which corruption was again endemic; the APC won 74 seats and the SLPP 15. In 1978, the APC-dominant parliament approved a new constitution making the country a [[one-party state]]. The 1978 constitution made the APC the only legal political party in Sierra Leone.<ref name=Gberie>Gberie, Lansana (1998). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/30/ War and state collapse: The case of Sierra Leone]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University</ref> This move led to another major demonstration against the government in many parts of the country, but again it was put down by the army and Stevens' SSD forces.

Stevens is generally criticised for dictatorial methods and government corruption, but on a positive note, he kept the country stable and from collapsing into civil war. He built several government institutions that are still in use today.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Stevens also reduced ethnic polarisation in government by incorporating members of various ethnic groups into his all-dominant APC government.

Siaka Stevens retired from politics in November 1985 after being in power for eighteen years. The APC named a new presidential candidate to succeed Stevens at their last delegate conference held in Freetown in November 1985. He was [[Major General]] [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], the head of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces and Stevens' own choice to succeed him. As head of the Sierra Leone Armed Forces, Major General Momoh was very loyal to Stevens, who had appointed him to the position. Like Stevens, Momoh was also a member of the minority [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] ethnic group.

Momoh was elected president as the only contesting candidate, without any opposition, and was sworn in as Sierra Leone's second president on 28 November 1985 in Freetown. A one-party parliamentary election between APC members was held in May 1986. President Momoh appointed his former military colleague and key ally, Major General Mohamed Tarawalie to succeed him as the head of the Sierra Leone Military. Major General Tarawalie was also a strong loyalist and key supporter of president Momoh. President Momoh named James Bambay Kamara as the head of the [[Sierra Leone Police]]. Bambay Kamara was a key loyalist and strong supporter of President Momoh. Momoh broke away from former president Siaka Stevens, by integrating the powerful SSD into the Sierra Leone Police as a special [[paramilitary force]] of the Sierra Leone Police. Under President Stevens, the SSD had been a powerful personal force used to maintain his hold on power, independent from the Sierra Leone Military and Sierra Leone Police Force. The Sierra Leone Police under Bambay Kamara's leadership, was accused of physical violence, arrest and intimidation against critics of President Momoh's government.

President Momoh's strong links with the army and his verbal attacks on corruption earned him much-needed initial support among Sierra Leoneans. With the lack of new faces in the new APC cabinet under president Momoh and the return of many of the old faces from Stevens' government, criticisms soon arose that Momoh was simply perpetuating the rule of Stevens.

The next couple of years under the Momoh administration were characterised by corruption, which Momoh defused by sacking several senior cabinet ministers. To formalise his war against corruption, President Momoh announced a "[[Code of Conduct]] for Political Leaders and Public Servants." After an alleged attempt to overthrow President Momoh in March 1987, more than 60 senior government officials were arrested, including Vice President [[Francis Minah]], who was removed from office, convicted of plotting the coup, and executed by [[hanging]] in 1989 along with 5 others.

=== Sierra Leone Civil War (1991–2002) ===
{{Further|Sierra Leone Civil War}}
[[File:School destroyed by Sierra Leone Civil War.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A school in [[Koindu]] destroyed during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Civil War]]; in total 1,270 primary schools were destroyed in the War.<ref name="ilab"/>]]
In October 1990, owing to mounting pressure from both within and outside the country for political and economic reform, president Momoh set up a constitutional review commission to assess the 1978 one-party constitution. Based on the commission's recommendations a constitution re-establishing a multi-party system was approved by the exclusive APC Parliament by a 60% majority vote, becoming effective on 1 October 1991. There was great suspicion that president Momoh was not serious about his promise of political reform, as APC rule continued to be increasingly marked by abuses of power.

The brutal civil war that was going on in neighbouring [[Liberia]] played a significant role in the outbreak of fighting in Sierra Leone. [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] – then leader of the [[National Patriotic Front of Liberia]] – reportedly helped form the [[Revolutionary United Front|Revolutionary United Front (RUF)]] under the command of former Sierra Leonean army [[corporal]] [[Foday Sankoh|Foday Saybana Sankoh]], an ethnic Temne from [[Tonkolili District]] in Northern Sierra Leone. Sankoh was a British trained former army corporal who had also undergone guerrilla training in Libya. Taylor's aim was for the RUF to attack the bases of Nigerian dominated peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone who were opposed to his rebel movement in Liberia.

On 29 April 1992, a group of young soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army, led by seven army officers — Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, Captain [[Valentine Strasser]], Sargent [[Solomon Musa]], Captain [[Komba Mondeh]], Lieutenant [[Tom Nyuma]], Captain [[Julius Maada Bio]] and Captain Komba Kambo—<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |title=NPRC's Komba Kambo Speaks After Eleven Years Of Silence!: Sierra Leone News |publisher=News.sl |accessdate=17 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222185702/http://news.sl/drwebsite/exec/view.cgi?archive=2&num=106 |archivedate=22 February 2014  }}</ref> launched a [[military coup]] that sent president Momoh into [[exile]] in Guinea, and the young soldiers established the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC), with 25-year-old Captain Valentine Strasser as its chairman and Head of State of the country.<ref name="blogspot1">{{cite web|url=http://salonenow.blogspot.com/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html#!/2011/08/attempts-to-launder-maada-bios-battered.html |title=SIERRA LEONE NOW: Attempts To Launder Maada Bio's Battered Image Fail...

Sargent Solomon Musa, a childhood friend of Strasser, became the deputy chairman and deputy leader of the NPRC [[Military junta|junta]] government. Strasser became the world's youngest Head of State when he seized power just three days after his 25th birthday. The NPRC junta established the National Supreme Council of State as the military highest command and final authority in all matters, and was exclusively made up of the highest ranking NPRC soldiers, included Strasser himself and the original soldiers who toppled president Momoh.<ref name="blogspot1"/>

One of the highest ranking soldiers of the NPRC Junta, Lieutenant Sahr Sandy, a trusted ally of Strasser, was assassinated, allegedly by Major S.I.M. Turay, a key loyalist of ousted president Momoh. A heavily armed military manhunt took place across the country to find Lieutenant Sandy's killer. However, the main suspect, Major S.I.M Turay, went into hiding and fled the country to Guinea, fearing for his life. Dozens of soldiers loyal to the ousted president Momoh were arrested, including colonel Kahota M Dumbuya and Major Yayah Turay. Lieutenant Sandy was given a [[state funeral]] and his funeral prayers service at the [[cathedral]] church in Freetown was attended by many high-ranking soldiers of the NPRC junta, including Strasser himself and NPRC deputy leader Sergeant Solomom Musa

The NPRC Junta immediately suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, limited [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] and enacted a rule-by-decree policy, in which soldiers were granted unlimited powers of administrative detention without charge or trial, and challenges against such detentions in court were precluded.

The NPRC Junta maintained relations with the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and strengthened support for Sierra Leone-based [[Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group|ECOMOG]] troops fighting in Liberia. On 28 December 1992, an alleged coup attempt against the NPRC government of Strasser, aimed at freeing the detained Colonel Yahya Kanu, Colonel Kahota M.S. Dumbuya and former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, was foiled. Several Junior army officers led by Seargen Mohamed Lamin Bangura were identified as being behind the coup plot. The coup plot led to the [[firing squad]] execution of seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone Army including Colonel Kahota M Dumbuya, Major Yayah Kanu and Seargent Mohamed Lamin Bangura. Several prominent members of the Momoh government who had been in detention at the Pa Demba Road prison, including former inspector general of police Bambay Kamara, were also executed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardtimespress.org/artman/publish/article_4699.shtml |title=STANDARD TIMES PRESS SIERRA LEONE NPRC's Ruthlessness No Death Certificates For 29 Sierra Leoneans PAGE |publisher=Standardtimespress.org |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>

On 5 July 1994 the deputy NPRC leader Seargent Solomon Musu, who was very popular with the general population, particularly in Freetown, was arrested and sent into exile after he was accused of planning a coup to topple Strasser, an accusation Seargent Musa denied. Strasser replaced Musa as deputy NPRC chairman with Captain Julius Maada Bio, who was instantly promoted by Strasser to [[Brigadier]].

The NPRC proved to be nearly as ineffectual as the Momoh-led APC government in repelling the RUF. More and more of the country fell to RUF fighters, and by 1994 they held much of the diamond-rich Eastern Province and were at the edge of Freetown. In response, the NPRC hired several hundred mercenaries from the private firm [[Executive Outcomes]]. Within a month they had driven RUF fighters back to enclaves along Sierra Leone's borders, and cleared the RUF from the Kono diamond-producing areas of Sierra Leone.

With Strasser's two most senior NPRC allies and commanders Lieutenant Sahr Sandy and Lieutenant [[Solomon Musa]] no longer around to defend him, Strasser's leadership within the NPRC Supreme Council of State was not considered much stronger. On 16 January 1996, after about four years in power, Strasser was arrested in a palace coup at the Defence Headquarters in Freetown by his fellow NPRC soldiers.<ref name="FSL Vol 2 No 1">{{cite web |url=http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |title=FSL Vol 2 No 1 |publisher=Focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk |accessdate=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928012312/http://www.focus-on-sierra-leone.co.uk/Vol2_1.htm |archive-date=28 September 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Strasser was immediately flown into exile in a [[military helicopter]] to [[Conakry]], [[Guinea]].

In his first public broadcast to the nation following the 1996 coup, Brigadier Bio stated that his support for returning Sierra Leone to a democratically elected civilian government and his commitment to ending the civil war were his motivations for the coup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/How+Sierra+Leone+fell+into+the+hands+of+young+soldiers.-a0254314002 |title=How Sierra Leone fell into the hands of young soldiers|publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> Promises of a return to civilian rule were fulfilled by Bio, who handed power over to [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], of the Sierra Leone People's Party (SLPP), after the conclusion of elections in early 1996. President Kabbah took power with a great promise of ending the civil war. President Kabbah opened [[dialogue]] with the RUF and invited RUF leader Foday Sankoh for peace negotiations.

On 25 May 1997, seventeen soldiers in the Sierra Leone army led by Corporal Tamba Gborie, loyal to the detained [[Major General]] [[Johnny Paul Koroma]], launched a military coup which sent President Kabbah into exile in Guinea and they established the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC). Corporal Gborie quickly went to the SLBS FM 99.9 headquarters in Freetown to announce the coup to a shocked nation and to alert all soldiers across the country to report for guard duty. The soldiers immediately released Koroma from prison and installed him as their chairman and Head of State.

Koroma suspended the constitution, banned demonstrations, shut down all private radio stations in the country and invited the RUF to join the new junta government, with its leader Foday Sankoh as the Vice-Chairman of the new AFRC-RUF coalition junta government. Within days, Freetown was overwhelmed by the presence of the RUF combatants who came to the city in thousands. The Kamajors, a group of traditional fighters mostly from the Mende ethnic group under the command of deputy [[Defence Minister]] [[Samuel Hinga Norman]], remained loyal to President Kabbah and defended the Southern part of Sierra Leone from the soldiers.

=== Kabbah's government and the end of civil war (2002–2014) ===
{{update|section|date=February 2013}}
After nine months in office, the junta was overthrown by the Nigerian-led [[ECOMOG]] forces, and the democratically elected government of president Kabbah was reinstated in February 1998. On 19 October 1998 24 soldiers in the Sierra Leone army were executed by firing squad after they were convicted in a [[court martial]] in Freetown, some for orchestrating the 1997 coup that overthrew President Kabbah and others for failure to reverse the mutiny.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr51/019/1998/en/ Document – Sierra Leone: Imminent execution / death penalty / legal concern |Amnesty International] . Amnesty.org (1998). Retrieved on 26 February 2013.</ref>

In October 1999, the United Nations agreed to send [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to help restore order and disarm the rebels. The first of the 6,000-member force began arriving in December, and the [[UN Security Council]] voted in February 2000 to increase the force to 11,000, and later to 13,000. But in May, when nearly all [[Nigeria]]n forces had left and UN forces were trying to disarm the RUF in eastern Sierra Leone, [[Foday Sankoh|Sankoh]]'s forces clashed with the UN troops, and some 500 peacekeepers were taken [[hostage]] as the peace accord effectively collapsed. The hostage crisis resulted in more fighting between the RUF and the government as UN troops launched [[Operation Khukri]] to end the siege. The Operation was successful with Indian and British [[Special Forces]] being the main contingents.

The situation in the country deteriorated to such an extent that British troops were deployed in [[Operation Palliser]], originally simply to evacuate foreign nationals. However, the British exceeded their original mandate, and took full military action to finally defeat the rebels and restore order. The British were the catalyst for the ceasefire that ended the civil war. Elements of the [[British Army]], together with administrators and politicians, remain in Sierra Leone to this day, helping train the armed forces, improve the infrastructure of the country and administer financial and material aid. [[Tony Blair]], the Prime Minister of Britain at the time of the British intervention, is regarded as a hero by the people of Sierra Leone, many of whom are keen for more British involvement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Sierra Leoneans have been described as "The World's Most Resilient People".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bah|first=M.|title=The Worlds Most Resilient People|year=1998|publisher=Alpha|location=London}}</ref>

Between 1991 and 2001, about [[List of wars by death toll|50,000 people were killed]] in Sierra Leone's civil war. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced from their homes and many became refugees in [[Guinea]] and [[Liberia]]. In 2001, UN forces moved into rebel-held areas and began to disarm rebel soldiers. By January 2002, the war was declared over. In May 2002, [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah|Kabbah]] was re-elected president by a landslide. By 2004, the disarmament process was complete. Also in 2004, a UN-backed [[war crime]]s court began holding trials of senior leaders from both sides of the war. In December 2005, UN peacekeeping forces pulled out of Sierra Leone.

In August 2007, Sierra Leone held presidential and parliamentary elections. However, no presidential candidate won the 50% plus one vote majority stipulated in the constitution on the first round of voting. A runoff election was held in September 2007, and [[Ernest Bai Koroma]], the candidate of the main opposition APC, was elected president. Koroma was re-elected president for a second (and final) term in November 2012.

== Government and politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Sierra Leone}}
[[File:Ernest Bai Koroma.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ernest Bai Koroma]], former president of Sierra Leone]]
Sierra Leone is a constitutional republic with a [[Direct democracy|directly elected]] president and a [[unicameral legislature]]. The current system of the [[Government of Sierra Leone]] is based on the 1991 Sierra Leone Constitution. Sierra Leone has a dominant [[unitary state|unitary]] [[central government]] and a weak [[local government]]. The [[executive branch]] of the Government of Sierra Leone, headed by the [[president of Sierra Leone]] has extensive powers and influences. The president is the most powerful government official in Sierra Leone.<ref name="nyulawglobal.org">Hanatu Kabbah (November 2006).

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Sierra Leone}}
[[File:Sierra Leone Districts.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The 12 districts and 2 areas of Sierra Leone]]
The Republic of Sierra Leone is composed of four regions: the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Province]], [[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|Southern Province]], the [[Eastern Province, Sierra Leone|Eastern Province]], and the [[Western Area]]. Three provinces are further divided into 12 districts; and the Western Area is divided into two districts.

The provincial districts are divided into 149 chiefdoms, which have traditionally been led by [[paramount chiefs]], recognised by the British administration in 1896 at the time of organising the Protectorate of Sierra Leone. The Paramount Chiefs are very influential, particularly in [[villages]] and small rural towns.<ref name="tristan">[http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/history.pdf Tristan Reed and James A. Robinson, ''The Chiefdoms of Sierra Leone''], ''Scholar'', Harvard University, 15 July 2013, accessed 30 April 2014</ref> Each chiefdom has ruling families that were recognised at that time; the Tribal Authority, made up of local notables, elects the paramount chief from the ruling families.<ref name="tristan"/> Typically, chiefs have the power to "raise taxes, control the judicial system, and allocate land, the most important resource in rural areas."<ref name="daron">[http://public-prod-acquia.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/documents/pe_10_13_Robinson_0.pdf Daron Acemoglu, Tristan Reed. and James A.

Within the context of local governance, the districts are governed as ''localities''. Each has a directly elected local district council to exercise authority and carry out functions at a local level.<ref name="Renner-Thomas 2010 6–7">{{Cite book |last =Renner-Thomas |first = Ade |title = Land Tenure in Sierra Leone: The Law, Dualism and the Making of a Land Policy |publisher =AuthorHouse |year =2010 |pages = 6–7 |url =https://books.google.com/?id=RiIpW6vWVPoC&pg=PA5|isbn=978-1-4490-5866-1|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = ActionAid launches Perception survey as new local councils struggle to survive |publisher = ActionAid |url = http://www.actionaid.org/tanzania/index.aspx?PageID=3925|accessdate =26 February 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2014}}</ref> In total, there are 19 local councils: 13 district councils, one for each of the 12 districts and one for the Western Area Rural, and six municipalities also have elected local councils.

While the district councils are under the oversight of their respective provincial administrations, the municipalities are directly overseen by the Ministry of Local Government & Community Development and thus administratively independent of district and provincial administrations.

=== Military ===
{{Main|Military of Sierra Leone}}

The Military of Sierra Leone, officially the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF), are the unified armed forces of Sierra Leone responsible for the territorial security of Sierra Leone's border and defending the national interests of Sierra Leone within the framework of its international obligations. The armed forces were formed after independence in 1961, on the basis of elements of the former British [[Royal West African Frontier Force]] present in the country. The Sierra Leone Armed Forces consists of around 15,500 personnel, comprising the largest Sierra Leone Army,<ref>[http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/wafrsu/siers100.html Armed forces (Sierra Leone) Jane's Sentinel Security Assessments], June 2008</ref> the Sierra Leone Navy and the Sierra Leone Air Wing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-World-Air-Forces/Summary-Sierra-Leone.html |title=Summary (Sierra Leone) – Jane's World Air Forces |publisher=Janes.com |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref>

The president of Sierra Leone is the [[Commander in Chief]] of the military, with the Minister of Defence responsible for defence policy and the formulation of the armed forces. The current Sierra Leone Defence Minister is retired Major [[Paolo Conteh|Alfred Paolo Conteh]]. The Military of Sierra Leone also has a [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Sierra Leone)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] who is a uniformed [[military official]] responsible for the administration and the operational control of the Sierra Leone military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200511647.shtml |title=In Sierra Leone, Army Chief of Defence Staff Commends Troops |publisher=News.sl |date=26 March 2009 |author=Turay, Aruna |accessdate=20 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327084222/http://www.news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200511647.shtml |archivedate=27 March 2012  }}</ref> [[Brigadier General]] [[Alfred Nelson-Williams]] who was appointed by president Koroma succeeded the retired [[Major General]] [[Edward Sam M’boma]] on 12 September 2008 as the Chief of Defence Staff of the Military.<ref>New Vision, Freetown, 15 September 2008</ref>

Before Sierra Leone gained independence in 1961, the military was known as the Royal Sierra Leone Military Force. The military seized control in 1968, bringing the [[National Reformation Council]] into power. On 19 April 1971, when Sierra Leone became a republic, the Royal Sierra Leone Military Forces were renamed the Republic of Sierra Leone Military Force (RSLMF).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daco-sl.org/encyclopedia/1_gov/1_6rslaf.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111070308/http://www.daco-sl.org/encyclopedia/1_gov/1_6rslaf.htm |archivedate=11 January 2010 |title=Partners: Sierra Leone Armed Forces |publisher=Daco-sl.org |accessdate=20 May 2012 |deadurl=yes  }}</ref> The RSLMF remained a single-service organisation until 1979, when the Sierra Leone Navy was established. In 1995 Defence Headquarters was established, and the Sierra Leone Air Wing formed. The RSLMF was renamed as the Armed Forces of the Republic of Sierra Leone (AFRSL).

=== Law enforcement ===
Law enforcement in Sierra Leone is primarily the responsibility of the [[Sierra Leone Police]] (SLP). Sierra Leone Police was established by the [[British colony]] in 1894; it is one of the oldest police forces in West Africa. It works to prevent crime, protect life and property, detect and prosecute offenders, maintain [[public order]], ensure safety and security, and enhance access to justice. The Sierra Leone Police is headed by the [[Inspector General of Police]], the professional head of the Sierra Leone Police force, who is appointed by the [[President of Sierra Leone]].

Each one of [[Districts of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone's 14 districts]] is headed by a district police commissioner who is the professional head of their respective district. These Police Commissioners report directly to the Inspector General of Police at the Sierra Leone Police headquarters in [[Freetown]]. The current Inspector General of Police is [[Brima Acha Kamara]], who was appointed to the position by former president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]].

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Sierra Leone}}[[File:Sierra Leone Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Sierra Leone's exports]]
By the 1990s economic activity was declining and economic infrastructure had become seriously degraded. Over the next decade much of the formal economy was destroyed in the country's civil war. Since the end of hostilities in January 2002, massive infusions of outside assistance have helped Sierra Leone begin to recover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=0&sid=5f07db80-0c1e-4b66-9ebb-cfb4989d1e47@sessionmgr103|title=Economic Methodology: Paradox of Ceteris Paribus (CP) Law in the Context of...: Full Text Finder Results|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=16 September 2017}}{{Dead link|date=December 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Much of the recovery will depend on the success of the government's efforts to limit corruption by officials, which many feel was the chief cause for the civil war. A key indicator of success will be the effectiveness of government management of its diamond sector.

There is high unemployment, particularly among the youth and ex-combatants. Authorities have been slow to implement reforms in the civil service, and the pace of the privatisation programme is also slackening and donors have urged its advancement.

The currency is the [[Sierra Leonean leone|leone]]. The [[central bank]] is the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]]. Sierra Leone operates a floating [[exchange rate]] system, and foreign currencies can be exchanged at any of the commercial banks, recognised foreign exchange [[Service bureau|bureaux]] and most hotels. Credit card use is limited in Sierra Leone, though they may be used at some hotels and restaurants. There are a few internationally linked [[automated teller machine]]s that accept [[Visa card]]s in Freetown operated by ProCredit Bank.

Sierra Leone is a country that is exposed to vulnerable situations (not so as a result of the non-existence of natural wealth), but more to do with poor management of its natural wealth (linked with the concept of [[resource curse]]).<ref name="Abraham.">{{cite web |title = Economic Methodology: Paradox of Ceteris Paribus (CP) Law in the Context of Sierra Leone.|publisher = Economic Insights – Trends & Challenges |date = 3 July 2016 |url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip&db=bth&AN=120473292&site=eds-live&scope=site |accessdate = 15 September 2017}}</ref>

=== Mining ===
{{Further|Mining in Sierra Leone}}

Rich in minerals, Sierra Leone has relied on mining, especially diamonds, for its economic base. The country is among the top ten diamond producing nations. Mineral exports remain the main [[currency]] earner. Sierra Leone is a major producer of gem-quality diamonds. Though rich in diamonds, it has historically struggled to manage their exploitation and export.

Sierra Leone is known for its [[blood diamond]]s that were mined and sold to diamond conglomerates during the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war]], to buy the weapons that fuelled its atrocities.<ref>{{cite news|title=UN targets 'blood diamonds' trade|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3117421.stm|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 April 2011|date=1 August 2003}}</ref> In the 1970s and early 1980s, economic growth rate slowed because of a decline in the mining sector and increasing corruption among government officials.

Annual production of Sierra Leone's diamond estimates range between US$250 million–$300&nbsp;million. Some of that is [[Smuggling|smuggled]], where it is possibly used for [[money laundering]] or financing illicit activities. Formal exports have dramatically improved since the civil war, with efforts to improve the management of them having some success. In October 2000, a UN-approved certification system for exporting diamonds from the country was put in place and led to a dramatic increase in legal exports. In 2001, the government created a mining community development fund ([[Ministry of Mineral Resources (Sierra Leone)|DACDF]]), which returns a portion of diamond export taxes to diamond mining communities. The fund was created to raise local communities' stake in the legal diamond trade.

Sierra Leone has one of the world's largest deposits of [[rutile]], a [[titanium]] ore used as [[paint]] pigment and [[welding]] rod coatings.

=== Transport infrastructure ===
{{Main|Transport in Sierra Leone}}
[[File:Kenema-Kailahun Road.jpg|thumb|The road from [[Kenema]] to [[Kailahun District]]]]
There are a number of systems of transport in Sierra Leone, which has a road, air and water infrastructure, including a network of highways and several airports. There are {{convert|11,300|km|abbr=off}} of highways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|904|km|0|abbr=on}}<ref name="CIA"/> are paved (about 8% of the roads). Sierra Leone highways are linked to [[Conakry]], Guinea, and [[Monrovia]], Liberia.

Sierra Leone has the largest [[natural harbour]] on the African continent, allowing international shipping through the [[Queen Elizabeth II Quay]] in the [[Cline Town, Sierra Leone|Cline Town]] area of eastern Freetown or through Government Wharf in central Freetown. There are {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} of waterways in Sierra Leone, of which {{convert|600|km|0|abbr=on}} are navigable year-round. Major port cities are [[Bonthe]], [[Freetown]], [[Sherbro Island]] and [[Pepel]].

There are ten [[regional airport]]s in Sierra Leone, and one [[international airport]]. The [[Lungi International Airport]] located in the coastal town of [[Lungi, Sierra Leone|Lungi]] in Northern Sierra Leone is the primary airport for domestic and international travel to or from Sierra Leone. Passengers cross the river to Aberdeen [[Heliport]]s in Freetown by [[hovercraft]], ferry or a [[helicopter]]. Helicopters are also available from the airport to other major cities in the country. The airport has [[Pavement (material)|paved]] runways longer than {{convert|3,047|m|abbr=off}}. The other airports have unpaved runways, and seven have runways from {{convert|914|to|1,523|m|abbr=off}} long; the remaining two have shorter runways.

Sierra Leone appears on the EU list of prohibited countries with regard to the certification of airlines. This means that no airline registered in Sierra Leone may operate services of any kind within the European Union. This is due to substandard safety standards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/pdf/list_en.pdf |title=List of banned E.U. air carriers |accessdate=11 July 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325010606/http://ec.europa.eu/transport/air-ban/pdf/list_en.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009  }}. ec.europa.eu</ref>

As of May 2014 the country's only [[Lungi International Airport|international airport]] had regularly scheduled direct flights to London, Paris, Brussels and most major cities in West Africa.

In September 2014 there were many Districts with travel restrictions including Kailahun, Kenema, Bombali, Tonkolili, and Port Loko because of [[Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone|Ebola]].<ref>[http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526223.shtml Sierra Leone News : Africell Presents Second Consignment of Food to all Quarantined Homes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006141855/http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200526223.shtml |date=6 October 2014 }}.

=== Energy in Sierra Leone ===

==== Overview ====
As of 2016, access to electricity in Sierra Leone was at about 12% for the entire population. Of this 12%, about 10% of the population was located in the urban capital, Freetown. This leaves around 2% of the rural population with access to electricity.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5aec17b7ed915d42f7c6beab/Energy_Africa_Access_Campaign_-_Policy_Compact_Sierra_Leone_Final_Report.pdf|title=Energy Africa Access Campaign Policy Compact Sierra Leone Final Report|website=assets.publishing.service.gov.uk|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> The majority of the population relies on biomass fuels for their daily survival, with firewood and coal used most prevalently.<ref name=":5" /> The burning of these sources has been reported to have adverse health effects on women and children.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Eldred Tunde|last2=Nakai|first2=Satoshi|date=2012-06-19|title=Prevalence of Acute Respiratory Infections in Women and Children in Western Sierra Leone due to Smoke from Wood and Charcoal Stoves|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=9|issue=6|pages=2252–2265|doi=10.3390/ijerph9062252|pmid=22829802|pmc=3397376|issn=1660-4601}}</ref> A 2012 study was done on the correlation between Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI), and burning biomass fuels in the home.

==== Solar Energy ====
In conjunction with the UK's [[Department for International Development]] (DFID), Sierra Leone has set the goal to provide solar power to all of its citizens by 2025.<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-leone-electricity-idUSKCN0Y21Q3|title=Sierra Leone solar push aims to bring electricity to all by 2025|date=2016-05-11|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> This overarching goal has been broken down into smaller goals as well. The first of these goals is to provide solar power to at least 50,000 homes in 2016, the second is 250,000 homes by 2017, and finally to provide power to 1,000,000 people by 2020.<ref name=":8" /> This initiative falls under the [[Energy Africa]] access campaign which seeks to provide electricity to 14 different African countries by 2030.<ref name=":2" /> Previous to this compact agreement, Sierra Leone's private sector for solar energy was weak, as it provided energy to less than 5% of the target population.<ref name=":2" /> Part of the reason for this was due to the import duties and taxes and the lack of quality control.<ref name=":2" /> In order to ensure that the Energy Africa goal is met, Sierra Leone has agreed to remove its import duties and Value Added Tax (VAT) on certified solar products.<ref name=":8" /> This change will attempt to encourage foreign investment while providing affordable, quality solar products to its citizens. It is estimated that there will be a 30% to 40% cost reduction on solar products with the lack of duties and taxes.<ref name=":2" />

==== Hydroelectric power ====
As of 2012, Sierra Leone has 3 main hydroelectric plants. The first is the Guma plant which was decommissioned in 1982, the second is the Dodo Plant which is located in the Eastern Province, and finally the [[Bumbuna Dam|Bumbuna plant]].<ref name=":7" /> There is also potential for several new hydroelectric plants to be opened on the Sewa River, Pampana River, Seli River, Moa River, and Little Scarcies.<ref name=":7" /> Amongst all these projects, both finished and potential, the Bumbuna dam still remains the largest of the hydroelectric projects in Sierra Leone.<ref name=":7" /> It is located near the Seli River and Freetown and was estimated to produce about 50 megawatts of electricity.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=https://www.centreforpublicimpact.org/case-study/bumbuna-hydroelectric-plant/|title=The endgame of the Bumbuna hydroelectric plant project|website=Centre for Public Impact (CPI)|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> There were plans to increase its capacity 400 megawatts by 2017 which would cost around $750 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sierraleone-energy-idUSTRE74P6PZ20110526|title=Sierra Leone signs MoU for $750 million hydro power boost|date=2011-05-26|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> It has been projected that the Bumbuna dam could potentially reduce the amount of spending on foreign fuel and save the country at least $2 million a month.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ozatp-sierraleone-hydro-20090924-idAFJOE58N05Y20090924|title=Hydro brings light and hope to Sierra Leone|date=2009-09-24|work=Reuters|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> In the past this project received its funding of over $200 million from a combination of the [[World Bank]], the [[African Development Bank]], and the Italian company [[Salini Impregilo]].<ref name=":9" />

Sierra Leone is officially a [[secular state]], although [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] are the two main religions in the country. The constitution of Sierra Leone provides for [[freedom of religion]] and the [[Government of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone Government]] generally protects it. The Sierra Leone Government is constitutionally forbidden from establishing a [[state religion]], though Muslim and Christian prayers are usually held in the country at the beginning of major political occasions, including presidential inauguration and the official opening of the new session of Parliament.

According to a 2010 estimates by the [[Pew Research Center]]<ref>http://www.statesmansyearbook.com/entry?entry=countries_sl.RELIGION</ref> 78% of Sierra Leone's population are [[Muslims]] (mostly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]), 20.9 are [[Christians]] (mostly [[Protestantism|Protestants]]) and 1% belong to a traditional African religion or other beliefs. The Inter-Religious Council of Sierra Leone estimated that 77% of Sierra Leone's population are Muslims, 21% are Christians, and 2% are followers of traditional African religion.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/171636.pdf Sierra Leone]. state.gov</ref> Most of Sierra Leone's ethnic groups are Muslim majority, including the country's two largest ethnic groups: the [[Mende people|Mende]] and [[Temne people|Temne]].

Recently there has been an increase of [[Pentecostal]] churches, especially in Freetown.

In September 2017, a Sierra Leone-based Nigerian [[Pentecostal]] Christian pastor name Victor Ajisafe was arrested by the [[Sierra Leone Police]] and held in [[jail]] after he preached an extreme [[religious intolerance]] and a [[fanatical]] [[hate speech]] against [[Islam]] and Sierra Leonean Muslims in particular at his church [[sermon]] in the capital [[Freetown]]. Ajisafe was apparently angry and [[jealous]] after a [[Zimbabwean]] internationally renowned  Muslim [[cleric]] [[Mufti Menk]] visited Sierra Leone and had approximately over one hundred thousand people in and outside the national stadium in Freetown to listen to his Islamic sermon in his visit to Sierra Leone on 21 to 23 September 2017.<ref>http://ayvnews.com/AYVNews/index.php/news/item/4084-mufti-menk-s-visit-to-sierra-loenep</ref> Many Christian organizations in Sierra Leone, including the Council of Churches condemned Ajisafe's sermon against Islam and Muslims. Ajisafe"s church was temporarily shut down by the Sierra Leone government and his church license was temporarily suspended too. The incident brought religious tension in Sierra Leone, in a country known for its very high level of religious tolerance, as many Sierra Leonean Muslims at home and abroad were extremely angry, many called for Ajisafe to be [[deported]] back to his home country of [[Nigeria]].

Sierra Leone is home to about sixteen [[ethnic groups]], each with its own language. The largest and most influential are the [[Temne people|Temne]] at about 36%, and the [[Mende people|Mende]] at about 33%. The Temne predominate in the [[Northern Province, Sierra Leone|Northern Sierra Leone]] and the [[Western Area, Sierra Leone|areas around the capital of Sierra Leone]]. The Mende predominate in [[Southern Province, Sierra Leone|South]]-Eastern Sierra Leone (with the exception of [[Kono District]]).

The vast majority of Temne are Muslims at over 85%; and with a significant Christian minority at about 10%. The Mende are also Muslim majority at about 70℅, though with a large Christian minority at about 30%. Sierra Leone's national politics centres on the competition between the north-west, dominated by the Temne, and the south-east dominated by the Mende. The vast majority of the Mende support the [[Sierra Leone People's Party]] (SLPP); while the majority of the Temne support the [[All People's Congress]] (APC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewpeople.com/national-news/politics/item/1764-sierra-leone-the-temnes-and-the-politics-of-the-all-peoples%E2%80%99-congress-apc |title=Sierra Leone: The Temnes and the Politics of the All Peoples' Congress (APC) |publisher=Thenewpeople.com |accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref>

The Mende, who are believed to be descendants of the [[Mane people|Mane]], originally occupied the Liberian hinterland. They began moving into Sierra Leone slowly and peacefully in the eighteenth century. The Temne are thought to have come from [[Futa Jallon]], which is in present-day [[Guinea]].

The third-largest ethnic group are the [[Limba people (Sierra Leone)|Limba]] at about 6.4% of the population. The Limba are [[indigenous peoples|native]] people of Sierra Leone. They have no tradition of origin, and it is believed that they have lived in Sierra Leone since before the European encounter. The Limba are primarily found in Northern Sierra Leone, particularly in [[Bombali District|Bombali]], [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and [[Koinadugu District]]. The Limba are about 60% Christian and 40% Muslims. The Limba are close political allies of the neighbouring Temne.

Since Independence, the Limba have traditionally been very influential in Sierra Leone's politics, along with the Mende. The vast majority of Limba support the All People's Congress (APC) political party. Sierra Leone's first and second presidents, [[Siaka Stevens]] and [[Joseph Saidu Momoh]], respectively, were both ethnic Limba. Sierra Leone's current [[Defense Minister]] [[Paolo Conteh|Alfred Paolo Conteh]] is an ethnic Limba.
 
One of the biggest minority ethnic groups are the [[Fula people|Fula]] at around 3.4% of the population. Descendants of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Fula migrant settlers from the [[Fouta Djalon]] region of Guinea, they live primarily in the northeast and the western area of Sierra Leone. The Fula are virtually all Muslims at over 99℅. The Fula are primarily [[merchant|traders]], and many live in middle-class homes. Because of their trading, the Fulas are found in nearly all parts of the country.

The other ethnic groups are the [[Mandingo people of Sierra Leone|Mandingo]] (also known as [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]]). They are descendants of [[Merchant|traders]] from Guinea who migrated to Sierra Leone during the late nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries. The Mandika are predominantly found in the east and the northern part of the country. They predominate in the large towns, most notably [[Karina, Sierra Leone|Karina]], in Bombali District in the north; [[Kabala, Sierra Leone|Kabala]] and [[Falaba]] in Koinadugu District in the north; and [[Yengema]], [[Kono District]] in the east of the country. Like the Fula, the Mandinka are virtually all Muslims at over 99℅. Sierra Leone's third president [[Ahmad Tejan Kabbah]], and Sierra Leone's first Vice-President [[Sorie Ibrahim Koroma]] were both ethnic Mandingo.

Next in proportion are the [[Kono people|Kono]], who live primarily in [[Kono District]] in Eastern Sierra Leone. The Kono are descendants of migrants from Guinea; today their workers are known primarily as diamond miners. The majority of the Kono ethnic group are Christians, though with an influential Muslim minority. Sierra Leone's former Vice-President [[Samuel Sam-Sumana|Alhaji Samuel Sam-Sumana]] is an ethnic Kono.

The small but significant [[Krio people]] (descendants of freed African American, [[West Indian]] and Liberated African slaves who settled in Freetown between 1787 and about 1885) make up about 3% of the population. They primarily occupy the capital city of [[Freetown]] and its surrounding [[Western Area]]. Krio culture reflects the Western culture and ideals within which many of their ancestors originated – they also had close ties with British officials and colonial administration during years of development.

The Krio have traditionally dominated Sierra Leone's judiciacy and Freetown's elected city council. One of the first ethnic groups to become educated according to Western traditions, they have traditionally been appointed to positions in the civil service, beginning during the colonial years. They continue to be influential in the civil service. The vast majority of Krios are Christians at about 90%, though with a small but significant Muslim minority at 10% known locally as Oku.

Other minority ethnic groups are the [[Kuranko people|Kuranko]], who are related to the Mandingo, and are largely Muslims. The Kuranko are believed to have begun arriving in Sierra Leone from Guinea in about 1600 and settled in the north, particularly in [[Koinadugu District]]. The Kuranko are primarily farmers; leaders among them have traditionally held several senior positions in the Military. The current Governor of the [[Bank of Sierra Leone]] [[Kaifala Marah]] is an ethnic Kuranko. The Kuranko are largely Muslim majority.

The [[Loko people|Loko]] in the north are native people of Sierra Leone, believed to have lived in Sierra Leone since the time of European encounter. Like the neighbouring Temne, the Loko are Muslim majority. The [[Susu people|Susu]] and their related [[Yalunka people|Yalunka]] are traders; both groups are primarily found in the far north in [[Kambia District|Kambia]] and Koinadugu District close to the border with Guinea. The Susu and Yalunka are both descendants of migrants from Guinea; and they both are virtually all Muslims at over 99%.

The [[Kissi people|Kissi]] live further inland in South-Eastern Sierra Leone. They predominate in the large town of [[Koindu]] and its surrounding areas in Kailahun District. The vast majority of Kissi are Christians. The much smaller [[Vai people|Vai]] and [[Kru people|Kru]] peoples are primarily found in [[Kailahun District|Kailahun]] and Pujehun Districts near the border with Liberia. The Kru predominate in the Kroubay neighbourhood in the capital Freetown. The Vai are largely Muslim majority at about 90℅, while the Kru are virtually all Christians at over 99℅.

On the coast in [[Bonthe District]] in the south are the [[Sherbro people|Sherbro]]. Native to Sierra Leone, they have occupied [[Sherbro Island]] since it was founded. The Sherbro are primarily [[fisherman]] and [[farmers]], and they are predominantly found in Bonthe District. The Sherbro are virtually all Christians, and their paramount chiefs had a history of intermarriage with British colonists and traders.

A small number of Sierra Leoneans are of partial or full [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] ancestry, descendants of traders who first came to the nation in the 19th century. They are locally known as Sierra Leonean-Lebanese. The Sierra Leonean-Lebanese community are primarily traders and they mostly live in middle-class households in the urban areas, primarily in [[Freetown]], [[Bo, Sierra Leone|Bo]], [[Kenema]], [[Koidu|Koidu Town]] and [[Makeni]].

== Gender equality  ==

==== Household ====
Although women account for about 50 percent of the population in Sierra Leone, only 28 percent are household heads.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=https://www.statistics.sl/images/StatisticsSL/Documents/Census/2015/sl_2015_phc_thematic_report_on_gender.pdf|title=Sierra Leone 2015 Population and Housing Census Thematic Report on Gender |author=Fatou Taqi |author2=Marian Vinnie-Wilson |author3=Alimatu Vandi |first=Fatou, Marian, Alimatu|date=2015|website=|access-date=}}</ref> As in the rest of the countries, education is a key factor in succeeding in aspects such as a well-paid jobs and covering the needs of a house. Rural areas are the most common to lack access to education having only male-headed four percent ahead of females with basic education and 1.2 percent more at post-graduate level.<ref name=":03" />

In Sierra Leone, normally, men are automatically positioned as household heads; and their status does not change if their marital status changes over time.<ref name=":03" /> However, female household does change depending on their marital status. A woman can be the head of the house only if she remains single for the rest of her life. But if a woman gets married, she will not be entitled as the head of the house anymore.<ref name=":03" /> Females can take over the household head if they become widowed or divorced.<ref name=":03" />

In the labor field, it is expected that the household will financially provide the needs of the family. However, females face gender discrimination making them the target of lower incomes and financial struggle.<ref name=":03" /> In numbers, females present a lower per cent (6.3) versus males (15.2) when it comes to be paid employees.<ref name=":03" />

==== War ====
Children who have been forced to be part of a war have experienced severe mental and emotional damage in Sierra Leone. However, the damage and way to deal with the effects of war depends on the gender of the kids. Both genders experienced and were involved in high levels of violence. Females, experiencing higher levels of rapes,  presented greater signs of depression and anxiety.<ref name=":12">{{Cite journal|date=2011-07-01|title=Sierra Leone's Child Soldiers: War Exposures and Mental Health Problems by Gender|journal=Journal of Adolescent Health|volume=49|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1016/j.jadohealth.2010.09.021|pmc=3124662|issn=1054-139X|last1=Betancourt|first1=Theresa S.|last2=Borisova|first2=Ivelina I.|last3=de la Soudière|first3=Marie|last4=Williamson|first4=John}}</ref> Males, on the other hand, presented higher levels of anxiety and hostility.<ref name=":12" /> Males also showed to be more vulnerable to depression after losing a care giver.<ref name=":12" />

==== Epidemics (Ebola) ====
With women being more than half the population of Sierra Leone, they contribute in great part to the country's economy and society.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/oct/14/ebola-women-sierra-leone|title=We can no longer ignore Ebola's wider impact – particularly on women {{!}} Jeanne Kamara|last=Freetown|first=Jeanne Kamara in|date=2014-10-14|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> Sierra Leonean woman in care-giving positions were particularly susceptible to the disease because of the potential close contact with infected individuals. If and when the infected person died, women were in charge of preparing the funeral, which involves touching the infected body which in turn gave women a high risk of becoming infected.<ref name=":22" /> The vulnerability in infected women with Ebola grows when health institutions can not provide a high quality service because they are full or do not have the right equipment to treat the patients.<ref name=":22" />

==== Gender-Based Violence ====
In certain societies such as Sierra Leone, the lack of social and economic support for women makes them more vulnerable, making them the target of gender violence . By managing to repress women, men possess greater power and become the decision-maker.<ref name=":3">Goba, Sylvia. (2006) [https://search.proquest.com/docview/236983269 "Violation of women's rights through domestic violence: The Case of Sierra Leone"].  Kampala: ''Women's World''. Iss. 39/40, pp. 12-16. Via [[ProQuest]]</ref> &nbsp;The method to implement gender-based violence can vary; it can be sexual, physical, verbal, economical, or emotional.<ref name=":3" /> Violence does not respect factors such as age, socio-economical position, or education.<ref name=":3" /> Denouncing violence is hard for most women due to the honor and reputation of their family name.<ref name=":3" /> A victim, who suffers from violence, begins to lose self-confidence due to fear of reporting the aggressor or exposing family problems.<ref name=":3" /> This is why a woman who suffers from physical violence prefers not to attend with a specialist to heal her wounds.<ref name=":3" /> In some other cases, when females dare to denounce the crime, the system is very corrupt that authorities involved accept bribes from the victimizer.<ref name=":3" />

==== Female Economy ====
Small female-operated business not only could contribute to Sierra Leone's economy, it could also help women to become independent in several ways. However, women face discrimination when it comes to obtain financial, social, and cultural help to start a business.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesierraleonetelegraph.com/gender-equality-in-sierra-leone-is-an-economic-imperative/|title=Gender equality in Sierra Leone is an economic imperative|last=Thomas|first=Abdul Rashid|date=2013-09-26|access-date=2018-12-15}}</ref> It is difficult to avoid the economic paralysis in Sierra Leone given that more than half of the population in the country is women.<ref name=":4" /> Due to the lack of access to basic education, women are the least prepared when in comes to process business license, register the name or contracting.<ref name=":4" /> Not having the capital to start a new business is the biggest barrier for women.<ref name=":4" /> With the lack of technology, mostly in all Sierra Leone, it is hard to help a business to function.<ref name=":4" />

In 2014 there was an outbreak of the [[2014 West Africa Ebola outbreak|Ebola virus in West Africa]]. As of 19 October 2014, there had been 3,706 cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone, and 1,259 deaths, including that of the leading physician trying to control the outbreak, [[Sheik Umar Khan]].<ref>[http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/137091/1/roadmapsitrep22Oct2014_eng.pdf EBOLA RESPONSE ROADMAP SITUATION REPORT].

Aside from the human cost, the outbreak was severely eroding the economy. By September 2014, with the closure of borders, the cancellation of airline flights, the evacuation of foreign workers and a collapse of cross-border trade, the national deficit of Sierra Leone and other affected countries was widening to the point where the IMF was considering expanding its financial support.<ref name="IMFebola">{{cite news|title=The economic impact of Ebola may kill more people than the virus itself|url=http://www.bignewsnetwork.com/index.php/sid/225466201|date=6 September 2014|accessdate=8 September 2014|publisher=''Big News Network.com''}}</ref>

Despite efforts by the government and numerous non-governmental organisations, access has not much improved since the end of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]] in 2002, stagnating at about 50% and even declining in rural areas.<ref name="JMP water">WHO/UNICEF [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] (updated March 2010) {{cite web |url=http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/SLE_wat.pdf |title=Estimates for the use of Improved Drinking-Water Sources, Sierra Leone |accessdate=6 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226083443/http://www.wssinfo.org/fileadmin/user_upload/resources/SLE_wat.pdf |archivedate=26 December 2011  }}</ref> It is hoped that a new dam in Orugu, for which China committed financing in 2009, will alleviate [[water scarcity]].<ref name="Orugu">{{cite web|url=http://www.ooskanews.com/middle-east-africa/china-lends-288-million-usd-sierra-leone-orugu-dam |title=China Lends $28.8 Million USD to Sierra Leone for Orugu Dam |publisher=OOSKAnews |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>

According to a national survey carried out in 2006, 84% of the urban population and 32% of the rural population had access to an [[improved water source]]. Those with access in rural areas were served almost exclusively by protected wells. The 68% of the rural population without access to an improved water source relied on surface water (50%), unprotected wells (9%) and unprotected springs (9%). Only 20% of the urban population and 1% of the rural population had access to piped drinking water in their home. Compared to the 2000 survey access has increased in urban areas, but has declined in rural areas, possibly because facilities have broken down because of a lack of maintenance.<ref name="JMP water"/><ref name="Pushak">{{cite web|title=Sierra Leone's Infrastructure.

With a new decentralisation policy, embodied in the Local Government Act of 2004, responsibility for water supply in areas outside the capital was passed from the central government to local councils. In Freetown the Guma Valley Water Company remains in charge of water supply.

[[File:Sierra Leone rice farming.jpg|thumb|Rice farming in Rolako]]
Rice is the [[staple food]] of Sierra Leone and is consumed at virtually every meal daily. The rice is prepared in numerous ways, and topped with a variety of sauces made from some of Sierra Leone's favourite toppings, including [[potato]] leaves, [[cassava]] leaves, [[Corchorus|crain crain]], [[okra]] soup, [[fried fish]] and [[peanut|groundnut]] stew.<ref>{{cite book|last=Massaquoi|first=Rachel C.

Along the streets of towns and cities across Sierra Leone one can find foods consisting of fruit, vegetables and snacks such as fresh [[mangoes]], oranges, pineapple, fried [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[ginger beer]], fried potato, fried cassava with pepper sauce; small bags of popcorn or peanuts, bread, roasted corn, or skewers of grilled meat or shrimp.

Poyo is a popular Sierra Leonean drink. It is a sweet, lightly fermented [[palm wine]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Albala|first=Ken|title=Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313376276|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zG1H75z0EYYC&pg=PA165&lpg=PA165|accessdate=17 June 2014}}</ref> and is found in bars in towns and villages across the country. Poyo bars are areas of lively informal debate about politics, [[Association football|football]], basketball, entertainment and other issues.

{{Main|Media of Sierra Leone}}

[[File:Radio listener in Sierra Leone.jpg|thumb|A radio listener in [[Kailahun]]]]
Media in Sierra Leone began with the introduction of the first [[printing press]] in Africa at the start of the 19th century. A strong free journalistic tradition developed with the creation of a number of newspapers. In the 1860s, the country became a journalist hub for Africa, with professionals travelling to the country from across the continent. At the end of the 19th century, the industry went into decline, and when radio was introduced in the 1930s, it became the primary communication media in the country.

The [[Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service]] (SLBS) was created by the colonial government in 1934 making it the earliest English language radio broadcaster service in West Africa. The service began broadcasting television in 1963, with coverage extended to all the districts in the country in 1978. In April 2010, the SLBS merged with the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping radio station in Sierra Leone to form the [[Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icfj.org/node/37444 |title=At Long Last, Recruitment Begins at Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation &#124; ICFJ – International Center for Journalists |publisher=ICFJ |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=20 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194354/http://www.icfj.org/node/37444 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slbc.sl/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SLBC-REPORT-Final-Copy.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811043953/http://www.slbc.sl/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/SLBC-REPORT-Final-Copy.pdf |archivedate=11 August 2013 |title=Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) Maiden Report 2010-2011}}</ref> the government-owned current national broadcaster in Sierra Leone.

[[File:Isata Mahoi radio editor and actress.jpg|thumb|[[Isata Mahoi]] shown editing radio programmes in Talking Drum studio [[Freetown]]; she is also an actress in the Sierra Leone radio soap opera ''[[Atunda Ayenda]]'']]
Radio is the most-popular and most-trusted media in Sierra Leone, with 85% of people having access to a radio and 72% of people in the country listening to the radio daily.<ref name="BBC"/> These levels do vary between areas of the country, with the [[Western Area]] having the highest levels and [[Kailahun]] the lowest. Stations mainly consist of local commercial stations with a limited broadcast range, combined with a few stations with national coverage – [[Capital Radio Sierra Leone]] being the largest of the commercial stations.

The United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNIOSIL) ran one of the most popular stations in the country, broadcasting programs in a range of languages. The UN mission were restructured in 2008 and it was decided that the UN Radio would be merged with SLBS to form the new Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC). This merger eventually happened in 2011 after the necessary legislation was enacted. SLBC transmits radio on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and has two television services, one of which is uplinked by satellite for international consumption. FM relays of [[BBC World Service]] (in Freetown, Bo, Kenema and Makeni), [[Radio France Internationale]] (Freetown only) and [[Voice of America]] (Freetown only) are also broadcast.

Outside the capital Freetown and other major cities, television is not watched by a great many people, although Bo, Kenema and Makeni are served by their own relays of the main SLBC service. There are three free terrestrial television stations in Sierra Leone, one run by the government SLBC and the other two are private stations in Freetown, Star TV which is run by the owner of the ''Standard Times'' newspaper and AYV - Africa Young Voices. There are a number of religious funded TV stations that operate intermittently. Two other commercial TV operators (ABC and AIT) closed after they were not profitable. In 2007, a pay-per-view service was also introduced by GTV as part of a pan-African television service in addition to the nine-year-old sub-Saharan Digital satellite television service (DStv) originating from Multichoice Africa in South Africa. GTV subsequently went out of business, leaving DStv as the only provider of subscription satellite television in the country. A number of organisations planned to operate digital terrestrial subscription TV services, with Multichoice's Go TV having built infrastructure ahead of getting a licence and ultimately failing to get a license.  ITV and SATCON are currently operational.

Internet access in Sierra Leone has been sparse but is on the increase, especially since the introduction of 3G/4G cellular phone services across the country. There are several main [[internet service providers]] (ISPs) operating in the country. Freetown has [[internet cafés]] and other businesses offering internet access. Problems experienced with access to the Internet include an intermittent electricity supply and a slow connection speed in the country outside Freetown.

=== Sports ===
{{Main|Sport in Sierra Leone}}
[[File:Sierra Leone National Stadium.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Sierra Leone National Stadium]]

[[Association football|Football]] is by far the most popular sport in Sierra Leone. Children, youth and adult are frequently seen playing [[street football]] across Sierra Leone. There are organised youth and adult football tournaments across the country, and there are various primary and secondary schools with football teams across Sierra Leone.

The Sierra Leone national football team, popularly known as the [[Leone Stars]], represents the country in international competitions. It has never qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] but participated in the [[1994 African Cup of Nations|1994]] and [[1996 African Cup of Nations]]. When the national football team, the Leone Stars, have a match, Sierra Leoneans across the country come together united in support of the national team and people rush to their local radio and television stations to follow the live match. The country's national television network, The Sierra Leone Broadcasting Corporation (SLBC) broadcasts the national football team live match, along with many local radio stations across the country.

When the Leone Stars win an important match, many youth across the county rush to the street to celebrate. Many of the Sierra Leone national team footballers play for teams based in Europe although virtually all of them started professional football in the [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]]. Many of the national team footballers are celebrities across Sierra Leone and they are often well known by the general population. Some of Sierra Leonean international footballers include [[Mohamed Kallon]], [[Mohamed Bangura (footballer)|Mohamed Bangura]], [[Rodney Strasser]], [[Kei Kamara]], [[Ibrahim Teteh Bangura]], [[Mustapha Dumbuya]], [[Christian Caulker]], [[Al Bangura|Alhassan Bangura]], [[Sheriff Suma]], [[Mohamed Kamara]], [[Umaru Bangura]] and [[Julius Wobay|Julius Gibrilla Woobay]].

The [[Sierra Leone National Premier League]] is the top professional football league in Sierra Leone and is controlled by the [[Sierra Leone Football Association]]. Fourteen clubs from across the country compete in the Sierra Leone Premier League. The two biggest and most successful football clubs are [[East End Lions]] and [[Mighty Blackpool]]. East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool have an intense rivalry and when they play each other the national stadium in Freetown is often sold out and supporters of both clubs often clash with each other before and after the game. There is a huge police presence inside and outside the national stadium during a match between the two great rivals to prevent a clash. Many Sierra Leonean youth follow the local football league.

Many Sierra Leonean youth, children and adults follow the major football leagues in Europe, particularly the English [[Premier League]], Italian [[Serie A]], Spanish [[La Liga]], German [[Bundesliga]] and French [[Ligue 1]].
The [[Sierra Leone cricket team]] represents Sierra Leone in international cricket competitions, and is among the best in West Africa. It became an affiliate member of the [[International Cricket Council]] in 2002. It made its international debut at the 2004 African Affiliates Championship, where it finished last of eight teams. But at the equivalent tournament in 2006, Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League, it finished as runner-up to [[Mozambique]], and just missed a promotion to Division Two.

In 2009, the Sierra Leone Under-19 team finished second in the African Under-19 Championship in Zambia, thus qualifying for the Under-19 World Cup qualifying tournament with nine other teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/403002.html |title=Cricinfo article Uganda and Sierra Leone Win Through |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date=5 May 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref> However, the team was unable to obtain Canadian visas to play in the tournament, which was held in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/other/content/story/423890.html |title=Visa Issues End Sierra Leone's World Cup Dream |publisher=Cricinfo article |date=7 September 2009 |accessdate=20 May 2012}}</ref>

Basketball is not a very popular sport in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leone national basketball team represents Sierra Leone in international men's basketball competitions and is controlled by the Sierra Leone Basketball Federation.

The [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) is popular among a small portion of the youth population. NBA superstars [[LeBron James]], [[Kobe Bryant]] and [[Kevin Durant]] are popular among Sierra Leone's youthful population. Former NBA stars, in particular [[Michael Jordan]], [[Shaquille O'Neal]], [[Allen Iverson]] and [[Magic Johnson]] are popular in the country. Michael Jordan in particular is the most famous basketball player in the country and he is very popular among the general population. Current NBA youngstar [[Victor Oladipo]] is of Sierra Leonean descent, as his father is a native of Sierra Leone.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-03-26/sports/38042288_1_dematha-gym-dunk-contest/2 |title=Washington Post: Breaking News, World, US, DC News & Analysis |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=20 March 2014}}{{dead link|date=March 2019}}</ref>

Although tennis is not very popular in the country, up-and-coming American player [[Frances Tiafoe]] is the son of two Sierra Leoneans who emigrated to the United States.

Sierra Leone is the first African country to join the [[International Floorball Federation]].

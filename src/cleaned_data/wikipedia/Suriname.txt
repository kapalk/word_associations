'''Suriname'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|sj|ʊər|ᵻ|n|æ|m}}, {{small|US also}} {{IPAc-en|-|n|ɑː|m}}, also sometimes spelled '''Surinam'''), officially known as the '''Republic of Suriname''' ({{lang-nl|Republiek Suriname}} {{IPA-nl|reːpyˌblik syːriˈnaːmə|}}), is a country on the northeastern [[Atlantic]] coast of South America. [[Borders of Suriname|It is bordered]] by the Atlantic Ocean to the north, [[French Guiana]] to the east, [[Guyana]] to the west and [[Brazil]] to the south. At just under {{convert|165000|km2|abbr=off|sp=us}}, it is the smallest [[sovereign state]] in South America.{{refn|group=note|Both [[French Guiana]] and [[Falkland Islands]] are less extensive and populous, but they are respectively an [[overseas department]] and [[overseas region|region]] of France and an [[British Overseas Territory|overseas territory]] of the United Kingdom.}} Suriname has a population of approximately {{UN_Population|Suriname}},{{UN_Population|ref}} most of whom live on the country's north coast, in and around the capital and largest city, [[Paramaribo]].

Suriname was long inhabited by various indigenous people before being invaded and contested by European powers from the 16th century, eventually coming under [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] rule in the late 17th century. As the chief [[sugar]] colony during the [[Dutch Surinam|Dutch colonial period]], it was primarily a [[plantation economy]] dependent on African slaves and, following the abolition of slavery in 1863, indentured servants from Asia. Suriname was ruled by the Dutch-[[chartered company]] [[Sociëteit van Suriname]] between 1683 and 1795.

In 1954, Suriname became one of the [[constituent state|constituent countries]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. On 25 November 1975, the [[Suriname (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|country of Suriname]] left the Kingdom of the Netherlands to become an [[independence|independent]] state, nonetheless maintaining close economic, diplomatic, and cultural ties to its former colonizer. Suriname is considered to be a culturally [[Caribbean]] country, and is a member of the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM). While [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language of government, business, media, and education,<ref name=cia/> [[Sranan Tongo]], an English-based [[English creole|creole language]], is a widely used ''[[lingua franca]]''. Suriname is the only sovereign nation outside Europe where Dutch is spoken by a majority of the population. As a legacy of colonization, the [[people of Suriname]] are among the most diverse in the world, spanning a multitude of ethnic, religious, and linguistic groups.

== Etymology == <!--linked-->
The name ''Suriname'' may derive from an indigenous people called ''Surinen,'' who inhabited the area at the time of European contact.<ref name=Britannica>"Suriname", ''The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Encyclopædia Britannica'', Volume 5. Edition 15, ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2002, p. 547</ref>

British settlers, who founded the first European colony at Marshall's Creek<ref name="Marshall">{{Cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=paQMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA253|title=Encyclopædia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, Volume XI|edition=Ninth Edition—Popular Reprint | quote=In 1614, the states of Holland granted to any Dutch citizen a four years' monopoly of any harbour or place of commerce which he might discover in that region (Guiana). The first settlement, however, in Suriname (in 1630) was made by an Englishman, whose name is still preserved by Marshall's Creek.| author1=Baynes| first1=Thomas Spencer| year=1888 }}</ref> along the [[Suriname River]], spelled the name as "Surinam".

When the territory was taken over by the Dutch, it became part of a group of colonies known as [[Dutch colonization of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]]. The official spelling of the country's English name was changed from "Surinam" to "Suriname" in January 1978, but "Surinam" can still be found in English. A notable example is Suriname's national airline, [[Surinam Airways]]. The older English name is reflected in the English pronunciation, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|sj|ʊər|ᵻ|n|æ|m|,_|-|n|ɑː|m}}. In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the official language of Suriname, the pronunciation is {{IPA-nl|ˌsyriˈnaːmə|}}, with the main stress on the third syllable and a [[schwa]] terminal vowel.

== History ==
[[File:Maroon village, Suriname River, 1955.jpg|thumb|left|Maroon village, along [[Suriname River]], 1955.]]
{{main|History of Suriname}}

Indigenous settlement of Suriname dates back to 3,000 BC. The largest tribes were the [[Arawak]], a nomadic coastal tribe that lived from hunting and fishing. They were the first inhabitants in the area. The [[Kalina people|Carib]] also settled in the area and conquered the Arawak by using their superior sailing ships. They settled in Galibi (''Kupali Yumï,'' meaning "tree of the forefathers") at the mouth of the [[Marowijne River]]. While the larger Arawak and Carib tribes lived along the coast and savanna, smaller groups of indigenous people lived in the inland rainforest, such as the [[Akurio]], [[Trió]], [[Warrau]], and [[Wayana]].

===Colonial period===
[[File:Presidential palace, Paramaribo, Suriname.jpg|thumb|[[Presidential Palace of Suriname]]]]

{{main|Surinam (Dutch colony)}}
{{main|Willoughbyland}}
Beginning in the 16th century, [[Kingdom of France|French]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and [[Kingdom of England|English]] explorers visited the area. A century later, [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] and [[Kingdom of England|English]] settlers established [[plantation]] colonies along the many rivers in the fertile Guiana plains. The earliest documented colony in [[The Guianas|Guiana]] was an English settlement named Marshall's Creek along the Suriname River.<ref name="Marshall"/> After that there was another short-lived English colony called [[Willoughbyland]] that lasted from 1650 to 1674.

Disputes arose between the Dutch and the English for control of this territory. In 1667, during negotiations leading to the [[Treaty of Breda (1667)|Treaty of Breda]], the Dutch decided to keep the nascent plantation colony of Suriname they had gained from the English. The English were able to keep [[New Amsterdam]], the main city of the former colony of [[New Netherland]] in North America on the mid-Atlantic coast. Already a cultural and economic hub in those days, they renamed it after the Duke of York: New York City.

In 1683, the [[Society of Suriname]] was founded by the city of [[Amsterdam]], the [[Cornelis van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck|Van Aerssen van Sommelsdijck]] family, and the [[Dutch West India Company]]. The society was chartered to manage and defend the colony. The planters of the colony relied heavily on [[Slavery in Africa|African slaves]] to cultivate, harvest and process the commodity crops of coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. Planters' treatment of the slaves was notoriously bad<ref>{{cite book|author=Streissguth, Tom |title=Suriname in Pictures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hldOMJHlGQwC&pg=PA23|year= 2009|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-1-57505-964-8|pages=23–}}</ref>—historian [[C.R. Boxer]] wrote that "man's inhumanity to man just about reached its limits in Surinam"<ref>{{cite book|title=The Dutch Seaborne Empire |author=Boxer, C.R. | authorlink=C.R. Boxer|pages=271–272|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0140136180 |date=1990}}</ref>—and many slaves escaped the plantations.

With the help of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native South Americans]] living in the adjoining rain forests, these runaway slaves established a new and unique culture in the interior that was highly successful in its own right. They were known collectively in English as [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], in French as ''Nèg'Marrons'' (literally meaning "brown negroes", that is "pale-skinned negroes"), and in Dutch as ''Marrons.''  The Maroons gradually developed several independent tribes through a process of [[ethnogenesis]], as they were made up of slaves from different African ethnicities. These tribes include the [[Saramaka]], Paramaka, [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] or Aukan, [[Kwinti]], [[Aluku]] or Boni, and Matawai.

[[File:Water-front houses in Paramaribo, 1955.jpg|thumb|Waterfront houses in [[Paramaribo]], 1955.]]
The Maroons often raided plantations to recruit new members from the slaves and capture women, as well as to acquire weapons, food and supplies. They sometimes killed planters and their families in the raids; colonists built defenses, which were so important they were shown on 18th-century maps, but these were not sufficient.<ref>[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/524/ Simon M. Mentelle, "Extract of the Dutch Map Representing the Colony of Surinam"], c.1777, Digital World Library via Library of Congress. Retrieved 26 May 2013</ref>

The colonists also mounted armed campaigns against the Maroons, who generally escaped through the rain forest, which they knew much better than did the colonists. To end hostilities, in the 18th century the European colonial authorities signed several peace treaties with different tribes. They granted the Maroons sovereign status and trade rights in their inland territories, giving them autonomy.

===Abolition of slavery===
From 1861 to 1863, with the [[American Civil War]] underway, and enslaved people escaping to [[Confederate States of America|Southern]] territory controlled by the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], United States President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Presidency of Abraham Lincoln|his administration]] looked abroad for places to relocate people who were freed from enslavement and who wanted to leave the United States. It opened negotiations with the Dutch government regarding African-American emigration to and colonization of the [[Surinam (Dutch colony)|Dutch colony of Suriname]]. Nothing came of the idea, and the idea was dropped after 1864.<ref>
{{cite journal|author=Douma, Michael J. |year=2015|url=https://michaeljdouma.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/douma-cwh.pdf |title= The Lincoln Administration's Negotiations to Colonize African Americans in Dutch Suriname|journal=Civil War History|volume=61|issue=2|pages=111–137|doi=10.1353/cwh.2015.0037}}</ref>

The Netherlands abolished slavery in Suriname in 1863, under a gradual process that required enslaved people to work on plantations for 10 transition years for minimal pay, which was considered as partial compensation for their masters. After 1873, most [[freedmen]] largely abandoned the plantations where they had worked for several generations in favor of the capital city, [[Paramaribo]].

As a plantation colony, Suriname had an economy dependent on labor-intensive commodity crops. To make up for a shortage of labor, the Dutch recruited and transported contract or [[indentured]] laborers from the [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern [[Indonesia]]) and [[India]] (the latter through an arrangement with the British, who then ruled the area). In addition, during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, small numbers of laborers, mostly men, were recruited from China and the Middle East.

Although Suriname's population remains relatively small, because of this complex colonization and exploitation, it is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse countries in the world.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/country_profiles/1211306.stm |title=Suriname Country Profile |date=14 September 2012 |publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dutch.berkeley.edu/mcnl/immigration/the-netherlands/the-surinamese/ |title=Multicultural Netherlands |year=2010 |publisher=UC Berkeley |accessdate=13 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723092050/http://dutch.berkeley.edu/mcnl/immigration/the-netherlands/the-surinamese/ |archivedate=23 July 2012 }}</ref>

===Decolonization===
{{see also|Decolonization of the Americas}}
During [[World War II]], on 23 November 1941, under an agreement with the [[Dutch government-in-exile|Netherlands government-in-exile]], the United States occupied Suriname to protect the [[bauxite]] mines to support the Allies' war effort.<ref>[http://faculty.virginia.edu/setear/students/fdrneutr/Home.html World War II Timeline]. Faculty.virginia.edu. Retrieved 15 August 2012.</ref> In 1942, the Dutch government-in-exile began to review the relations between the Netherlands and its colonies in terms of the post-war period.

In 1954, Suriname became one of the constituent countries of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], along with the [[Netherlands Antilles]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In this construction, the Netherlands retained control of its defense and foreign affairs. In 1974, the local government, led by the [[National Party of Suriname]] (NPS) (whose membership was largely [[Creole peoples|Creole]], meaning ethnically African or mixed African-European) started negotiations with the Dutch government leading towards full independence, which was granted on 25 November 1975. A large part of Suriname's economy for the first decade following independence was fueled by foreign aid provided by the Dutch government.

===Independence===
[[File:Henck Arron, Beatrix, Johan Ferrier 1975.jpg|thumb|[[Henck Arron]], [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] and [[Johan Ferrier]] on 25 November 1975.]]
The first President of the country was [[Johan Ferrier]], the former governor, with [[Henck Arron]] (the then leader of the NPS) as Prime Minister. In the years leading up to independence, nearly one-third of the population of Suriname emigrated to the Netherlands, amidst concern that the new country would fare worse under independence than it had as a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Indeed, Surinamese politics soon degenerated into ethnic polarization and corruption, with the NPS using Dutch aid money for partisan purposes. Its leaders were accused of fraud in the [[Surinamese general election, 1977|1977 elections]], in which Arron won a further term, and the discontent was such that a large chunk of the population fled to the Netherlands, joining the already significant Surinamese community there.<ref>Obituary "[[The Guardian]]", 24 January 2001.</ref>

===1980 military coup===
{{main|1980 Surinamese coup d'état}}

On 25 February 1980, a [[1980 Surinamese coup d'état|military coup]] overthrew Arron's government. It was initiated by a group of sixteen sergeants, led by [[Dési Bouterse]].<ref name=cia>{{cite web|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Suriname |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ns.html |year=2013 |accessdate=4 August 2013}}</ref> Opponents of the military regime attempted counter-coups in April 1980, August 1980, 15 March 1981, and again on 12 March 1982.

Hawker escaped from prison during the fourth counter-coup attempt, but he was captured and summarily executed. Between 2&nbsp;am and 5&nbsp;am on 7 December 1982, the military, under the leadership of [[Dési Bouterse]], rounded up 13 prominent citizens who had criticized the military dictatorship and held them at [[Fort Zeelandia (Paramaribo)|Fort Zeelandia]] in Paramaribo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/9910 |title=Bouterse heeft Daal en Rambocus doodgeschoten |date=23 March 2012 |publisher=Network Star Suriname, Paramaribo, Suriname }}</ref> The dictatorship had all these men [[December murders|executed over the next three days]], along with Rambocus and [[Jiwansingh Sheombar]] (who was also involved in the fourth counter-coup attempt).

===1987 elections and constitution===
{{more citations needed|date=October 2016}}
National elections were held in 1987. The National Assembly adopted a new constitution that allowed Bouterse to remain in charge of the army. Dissatisfied with the government, Bouterse summarily dismissed the ministers in 1990, by telephone. This event became popularly known as the "Telephone Coup". His power began to wane after the 1991 elections.

The brutal [[Suriname Guerrilla War|civil war between the Suriname army and Maroons]] loyal to rebel leader [[Ronnie Brunswijk]], begun in 1986, continued and its effects further weakened Bouterse's position during the 1990s. Due to the civil war, more than 10,000 Surinamese, mostly Maroons, fled to [[French Guiana]] in the late 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blada.com/data/File/2012pdf/panoimmigr102012.pdf |title=Panorama de la population immigrée en Guyane |publisher=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=2019-02-02}}</ref>

In 1999, the Netherlands tried Bouterse ''in absentia'' on drug smuggling charges. He was [[trial in absentia|convicted]] and sentenced to prison but remained in Suriname.

===21st century===
On 19 July 2010, the former dictator [[Dési Bouterse]] returned to power when he was elected as the new President of Suriname.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10690930 ''Suriname ex-strongman Bouterse back in power''], In: ''[[BBC News]]'', 19 July 2010</ref> Before his election in 2010, he, along with 24 others, had been charged with the murders of 15 prominent dissidents in the December murders. However, in 2012, two months before the verdict in the trial, the National Assembly extended its [[amnesty]] law and provided Bouterse and the others with amnesty of these charges. He was reelected on 14 July 2015.<ref>[http://www.voanews.com/content/suriname-bouterse-secures-second-presidential-term/2862157.html Suriname's Bouterse Secures Second Presidential Term], ''Voice of America News'', 14 July 2015</ref>

The Republic of Suriname is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, based on the [[Constitution of Suriname|Constitution of 1987]]. The legislative branch of government consists of a 51-member [[unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Suriname|National Assembly]], simultaneously and popularly elected for a five-year term.

In the elections held on Tuesday, 25 May 2010, the ''Megacombinatie'' won 23 of the National Assembly seats followed by ''Nationale Front'' with 20 seats. A much smaller number, important for coalition-building, went to the "A&#8209;combinatie" and to the ''Volksalliantie.'' The parties held negotiations to form coalitions. Elections were held on 25 May 2015, and the National Assembly again elected Desire Bouterse as President.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ns.html |title=Suriname: Government |work=The World Factbook |year=2018 |accessdate=6 May 2018}}</ref>

The [[President of Suriname]] is elected for a five-year term by a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly. If at least two-thirds of the National Assembly cannot agree to vote for one presidential candidate, a People's Assembly is formed from all National Assembly delegates and regional and municipal representatives who were elected by popular vote in the most recent national election. The president may be elected by a majority of the People's Assembly called for the special election.

As head of government, the president appoints a sixteen-minister cabinet. A vice president, is normally elected for a five-year term at the same time as the president, by a simple majority in the National Assembly or People's Assembly. There is no constitutional provision for removal or replacement of the president, except in the case of resignation.

The judiciary is headed by the [[High Court of Justice of Suriname]] (Supreme Court). This court supervises the magistrate courts. Members are appointed for life by the president in consultation with the National Assembly, the State Advisory Council, and the National Order of Private Attorneys. In April 2005, the regional [[Caribbean Court of Justice]], based in [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad]], was inaugurated. As the final court of appeal, it was intended to replace the London-based [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]].

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Suriname}}
President [[Dési Bouterse]] was convicted and sentenced in the [[Netherlands]] to 11 years of imprisonment for drug trafficking. He is the main suspect in the court case concerning the 'December murders,' the 1982 assassination of opponents of military rule in [[Fort Zeelandia (Paramaribo)|Fort Zeelandia]], Paramaribo. These two cases still strain relations between the Netherlands and Suriname.<ref name="minbuza"/>

Due to Suriname's Dutch colonial history, Suriname had a long-standing special relationship with the Netherlands. The Dutch government has stated that it will only maintain limited contact with the president.<ref name="minbuza">{{cite web |url=http://www.minbuza.nl/en/news/2011/11/the-netherlands-and-suriname-are-closely-linked.html |title=The Netherlands and Suriname are closely linked |publisher=MinBuZa.nl |date=18 November 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714163522/http://www.minbuza.nl/en/news/2011/11/the-netherlands-and-suriname-are-closely-linked.html |archive-date=14 July 2014 |dead-url=yes  }}</ref>

Bouterse was elected as president of Suriname in 2010.

Since 1991, the United States has maintained positive relations with Suriname. The two countries work together through the [[Caribbean Basin Security Initiative]] (CBSI) and the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). Suriname also receives military funding from the U.S. Department of Defense.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1893.htm |title=Suriname |publisher=US Department of State |date=3 September 2013 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>

[[European Union]] relations and cooperation with Suriname are carried out both on a bilateral and a regional basis. There are ongoing EU-[[Community of Latin American and Caribbean States]] (CELAC) and EU-[[CARIFORUM]] dialogues. Suriname is party to the [[Cotonou Agreement]], the partnership agreement among the members of the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/suriname/index_en.htm |title=European Union – EEAS (European External Action Service) &#124; EU Relations with Suriname |publisher=Europa (web portal) |date=19 June 2014 |accessdate=13 July 2014}}</ref>

In the late 2000s, Suriname intensified development cooperation with other developing countries. China's South-South cooperation with Suriname has included a number of large-scale infrastructure projects, including port rehabilitation and road construction. Brazil signed agreements to cooperate with Suriname in education, health, agriculture, and energy production.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/integracion_comercio/i_INTAL_IYT_36_2013_Abdenur.pdf|title=South-South Cooperation in Suriname: New Prospects for Infrastructure Integration?|pages=95–104|journal=Integration and Trade|volume=36|year=2013|issue=17|author=Erthal Abdenur, Adriana|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108023826/http://www.iadb.org/intal/intalcdi/integracion_comercio/i_INTAL_IYT_36_2013_Abdenur.pdf|archivedate=8 January 2014}}</ref>

==Military==
{{main|Military of Suriname}}
The Armed Forces of Suriname have three branches: the Army, the Air Force, and the Navy. The President of the Republic, [[Dési Bouterse]], is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (''Opperbevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten''). The President is assisted by the Minister of Defence. Beneath the President and Minister of Defence is the Commander of the Armed Forces (''Bevelhebber van de Strijdkrachten''). The Military Branches and regional Military Commands report to the Commander.

After the creation of the [[Statute of the Kingdom of the Netherlands]], the [[Royal Netherlands Army]] was entrusted with the defense of Suriname, while the defense of the [[Netherlands Antilles]] was the responsibility of the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]]. The army set up a separate ''Troepenmacht in Suriname'' (Forces in Suriname, TRIS). Upon independence in 1975, this force was turned into the ''Surinaamse Krijgsmacht'' (SKM):, Surinamese Armed Forces. On 25 February 1980, a group of 15 [[non-commissioned officers]] and one junior SKM officer, under the leadership of [[sergeant major]] [[Dési Bouterse]], overthrew the Government. Subsequently, the SKM was rebranded as ''Nationaal Leger'' (NL), National Army.

==Administrative divisions==
{{main|Districts of Suriname|Resorts of Suriname}}
The country is divided into ten administrative districts, each headed by a district commissioner appointed by the president, who also has the power of dismissal. Suriname is further subdivided into 62 resorts (ressorten).

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Suriname}}
[[File:Suriname with disputed territories.jpg|thumb|Map of Suriname anno 2016]]
[[File:Suriname map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Suriname map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Suriname is the smallest independent country in South America. Situated on the [[Guiana Shield]], it lies mostly between latitudes [[1st parallel north|1°]] and [[6th parallel north|6°N]], and longitudes [[54th meridian west|54°]] and [[58th meridian west|58°W]]. The country can be divided into two main geographic regions. The northern, lowland coastal area (roughly above the line Albina-Paranam-Wageningen) has been cultivated, and most of the population lives here. The southern part consists of tropical [[rainforest]] and sparsely inhabited [[savanna]] along the border with [[Brazil]], covering about 80% of Suriname's land surface.

The two main mountain ranges are the [[Bakhuys Mountains]] and the [[Van Asch Van Wijck Mountains]]. [[Julianatop]] is the highest mountain in the country at {{convert|1286|m|ft}} above sea level. Other mountains include [[Tafelberg, Suriname|Tafelberg]] at {{convert|1026|m|ft}}, Mount [[Kasikasima]] at {{convert|718|m|ft}}, Goliathberg at {{convert|358|m|ft}} and Voltzberg at {{convert|240|m|ft}}.

Suriname is situated between [[French Guiana]] to the east and [[Guyana]] to the west. The southern border is shared with [[Brazil]] and the northern border is the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast. The southernmost borders with French Guiana and Guyana are disputed by these countries along the [[Maroni River|Marowijne]] and [[Courantyne River|Corantijn]] rivers, respectively, while a part of the disputed [[maritime boundary]] with Guyana was arbitrated by a tribunal convened under the rules set out in [[:s:United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea/Annex VII|Annex VII]] of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] on 20 September 2007.<ref>[[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] – [http://www.pca-cpa.org/showpage.asp?pag_id=1147 Guyana v.

Retrieved 15 August 2012.</ref>

===Climate===
Lying [[2nd parallel north|2]] to [[5th parallel north|5 degrees north]] of the [[equator]], Suriname has a very hot and wet [[tropical climate]], and temperatures do not vary much throughout the year. Average relative humidity is between 80% and 90%. Its average temperature ranges from 29 to 34 degrees Celsius (84 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit). Due to the high humidity, actual temperatures are distorted and may therefore feel up to 6 degrees Celsius (11 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter than the recorded temperature. The year has two [[wet season]]s, from April to August and from November to February. It also has two [[dry season]]s, from August to November and February to April.

===Nature reserves===
Located in the upper [[Coppename River]] [[drainage basin|watershed]], the [[Central Suriname Nature Reserve]] has been designated a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] for its unspoiled forests and [[biodiversity]]. There are many national parks in the country including Galibi National Reserve along the coast; [[Brownsberg Nature Park]] and [[Eilerts de Haan Nature Park]] in central Suriname; and the Sipaliwani Nature Reserve on the Brazilian border. In all, 16% of the country's land area is national parks and lakes, according to the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre.<ref>UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre [http://www.wdpa.org/ ''World Databbase on Protected Areas''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804170907/http://www.wdpa.org/ |date=4 August 2009 }}</ref>

== Economy ==
{{main|Economy of Suriname}}
[[File:Suriname Export Treemap.png|thumb|Suriname Exports 2012 including artificial [[corundum]]]]

Suriname's democracy gained some strength after the turbulent 1990s, and its economy became more diversified and less dependent on Dutch financial assistance. [[Bauxite]] (aluminium ore) mining continues to be a strong revenue source, and the discovery and exploitation of oil and gold has added substantially to Suriname's economic independence. Agriculture, especially rice and bananas, remains a strong component of the economy, and [[ecotourism]] is providing new economic opportunities. More than 80% of Suriname's land-mass consists of unspoiled rain forest; with the establishment of the [[Central Suriname Nature Reserve]] in 1998, Suriname signalled its commitment to conservation of this precious resource. The Central Suriname Nature Reserve became a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000.

[[File:Financien.JPG|thumb|Ministry of Finance.]]
The economy of Suriname was dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for more than 15% of GDP and 70% of export earnings up to 2016. Other main export products include rice, bananas and [[shrimp]]. Suriname has recently started exploiting some of its sizeable [[Petroleum|oil]]<ref>Rigzone (3 January 2006).

About a quarter of the people work in the agricultural sector. The Surinamese economy is very dependent on commerce, its main trade partners being the Netherlands, the United States, Canada, and [[Caribbean]] countries, mainly [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the islands of the former [[Netherlands Antilles]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Suriname-FOREIGN-TRADE.html|title=Suriname – Foreign trade|year=2010|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Nations|accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>

After assuming power in the fall of 1996, the [[Jules Wijdenbosch|Wijdenbosch]] government ended the [[structural adjustment]] program of the previous government, claiming it was unfair to the poorer elements of society. Tax revenues fell as old taxes lapsed and the government failed to implement new tax alternatives. By the end of 1997, the allocation of new Dutch development funds was frozen as Surinamese Government relations with the Netherlands deteriorated. Economic growth slowed in 1998, with decline in the mining, construction, and [[utility]] sectors. Rampant government expenditures, poor tax collection, a bloated civil service, and reduced foreign aid in 1999 contributed to the fiscal deficit, estimated at 11% of GDP. The government sought to cover this deficit through monetary expansion, which led to a dramatic increase in inflation.  It takes longer on average to register a new business in Suriname than virtually any other country in the world (694 days or about 99 weeks).<ref>The Economist, Pocket World in Figures, 2008 Edition, London: Profile Books</ref>

{{main|Demographics of Suriname|Surinamese people}}

According to the 2012 census, Suriname had a population of 541,638 inhabitants.<ref name="statistics-suriname1"/> The Surinamese populace is characterized by its high level of diversity, wherein no particular demographic group constitutes a majority. This is a legacy of centuries of Dutch rule, which entailed successive periods of forced, contracted, or voluntary migration by various nationalities and ethnic groups from around the world.

The largest ethnic group are the [[Afro-Surinamese]] which form about 37% of the population, and are usually divided into two groups: the [[Creole peoples|Creoles]] and the [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]]. Surinamese [[Maroon (people)|Maroons]], whose ancestors are mostly runaway slaves that fled to the interior, comprise 21.7% of the population; they are divided into five main groups: [[Ndyuka people|Ndyuka]] (Aucans), [[Kwinti]], [[Matawai people|Matawai]], [[Saramaka|Saramaccans]] and [[Paramaccan]]s. Surinamese [[Creole peoples|Creoles]], mixed people descending from African slaves and mostly Dutch Europeans, form 15.7% of the population. [[Indo-Surinamese|East Indians]], who form 27% of the population, are the second largest group. They are descendants of 19th-century contract workers from [[India]], hailing mostly from the modern Indian states of [[Bihar]], Jharkhand, and Eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] along the Nepali border.  [[Javanese Surinamese|Javanese]] make up 14% of the population, and like the East Indians, descend largely from workers contracted from the island of [[Java]] in the former [[Dutch East Indies]] (modern [[Indonesia]]).<ref name="javanese in suriname">{{id icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110316132831/http://unik.kompasiana.com/2011/03/14/orang-jawa-di-suriname/ Orang Jawa di Suriname (Javanese in Suriname)], ''kompasiana'' (14 March 2011)</ref> 13.4% of the population identifies as being of mixed ethnic heritage.

Other sizeable groups include the [[Chinese Surinamese|Chinese]], originating from 19th-century contract workers and some recent migration, who number over 40,000 {{As of|2011|lc=y}}; [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], primarily [[Maronites]]; [[History of the Jews in Suriname|Jews]] of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]] and [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] origin, whose center of population was the community of [[Jodensavanne]]; and [[Brazilians in Suriname|Brazilians]], many of them laborers mining for gold.<ref>"[http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/violence-erupts-surinam Violence erupts in Surinam] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102065401/http://www.rnw.nl/english/article/violence-erupts-surinam |date=2 January 2010 }}". Radio Netherlands Worldwide. 26 December 2009.</ref>

A small but influential number of [[White Surinamese|Europeans]] remain in the country, comprising about 1 percent of the population. They are descended mostly from [[Dutch people|Dutch]] 19th-century immigrant farmers, known as "[[Dutch Surinamese|Boeroes]]" (derived from ''boer'', the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word for "farmer"), and to a lesser degree other European groups, such as [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] from [[Madeira]]. Many Boeroes [[White flight|left after independence in 1975]].

Various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] make up 3.7% of the population, with the main groups being the [[Akurio people|Akurio]], [[Arawak]], [[Kalina people|Kalina]] (Caribs), [[Tiriyó people|Tiriyó]] and [[Wayana people|Wayana]]. They live mainly in the districts of [[Paramaribo]], [[Wanica District|Wanica]], [[Para District|Para]], [[Marowijne District|Marowijne]] and [[Sipaliwini District|Sipaliwini]].<ref name="joshuaproject.net">{{cite web|author=Joshua Project |url=http://www.joshuaproject.net/peopctry.php |title=Joshuaproject.net |publisher=Joshuaproject.net |accessdate=28 March 2010}}</ref>

The vast majority of Suriname's inhabitants (about 90%) live in [[Paramaribo]] or on the coast.

===Emigration===

The choice of becoming Surinamese or Dutch citizens in the years leading up to Suriname's independence in 1975 led to a mass migration to the Netherlands. This migration continued in the period immediately after independence and during military rule in the 1980s and for largely economic reasons extended throughout the 1990s. The [[Surinamese people in the Netherlands|Surinamese community]] in the [[Netherlands]] numbered 350,300 {{As of|2013|lc=y}} (including children and grandchildren of Suriname migrants born in The Netherlands); this is compared to approximately 566,000<ref name=cia /> Surinamese in Suriname itself.

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], around 272,600 people from Suriname lived in other countries in the late 2010s, in particular in the Netherlands (ca 192,000), the [[French Republic]] (ca 25,000, most of them in [[French Guiana]]),{{refn|group=note|The [[International Organization for Migration]] made a confusion regarding the number of Surinamese migrants living in French Guiana.

Suriname's religious makeup is heterogeneous and reflective of the country's multicultural character.

According to the 2012 census, 48.4% were Christians;<ref name="CENSUS2012">[http://www.statistics-suriname.org/images/Presentatie.pdf 2012 Suriname Census Definitive Results]. Algemeen Bureau voor de Statistiek – Suriname.</ref> 26.7% of Surinamese were [[Protestants]] (11.18% [[Pentecostal]], 11.16% [[Moravian Church|Moravian]], and 4.4% of various other Protestant denominations) and 21.6% were [[Roman Catholics]].

===Largest cities===
The national capital, Paramaribo, is by far the dominant urban area, accounting for nearly half of Suriname's population and most of its urban residents; indeed, its population is greater than the next nine largest cities combined. Most municipalities are located within the capital's metropolitan area, or along the densely populated coastline.

====New Year's Eve====
[[File:Kerstoudjaar 037.jpg|thumb|Pagara (red firecracker ribbons).]]
New Year's Eve in Suriname is called ''Oud jaar'', or "old year". It is during this period that the Surinamese population goes to the city's commercial district to watch "demonstrational [[fireworks]]". The bigger stores invest in these [[firecrackers]] and display them out in the streets. Every year the length of them is compared, and high praises are given for the company that has imported the largest ribbon.

These celebrations start at 10 in the morning and finish the next day. The day is usually filled with laughter, dance, music, and drinking. When the night starts, the big street parties are already at full capacity. The most popular fiesta is the one that is held at [[café 't Vat]] in the main tourist district. The parties there stop between 10 and 11 at night, after which people go home to light their pagaras (red-firecracker-ribbons) at midnight.
After 12, the parties continue and the streets fill again until daybreak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/A-Sabbatical-in-Suriname-334838.html |title=A Sabbatical in Suriname – Fun Facts, Questions, Answers, Information |publisher=Funtrivia.com |date=25 February 1980 |accessdate=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922204719/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/A-Sabbatical-in-Suriname-334838.html |archive-date=22 September 2014 |dead-url=yes  }}</ref>

From elementary school to high school there are 13 grades. The elementary school has six grades, middle school four grades and high school three grades. Students take a test in the end of elementary school to determine whether they will go to the MULO (secondary modern school) or a middle school of lower standards like LBO. Students from the elementary school wear a green shirt with jeans, while middle school students wear a blue shirt with jeans.

Students going from the second grade of middle school to the third grade have to choose between the business or science courses. This will determine what their major subjects will be. In order to go on to study math and physics, the student must have a total of 12 points. If the student has fewer points, he/she will go into the business courses or fail the grade.

Tafelberg Mountain in the centre of the country is surrounded by its own reserve – the Tafelberg Nature Reserve – around the source of the [[Saramacca River]], as is the Voltzberg Nature Reserve further north on the Coppename River at Raleighvallen. In the interior are many [[Maroon (people)|Maroon]] and [[Amerindian]] villages, many of which have their own reserves that are generally open to visitors.

Suriname is one of the few countries in the world where at least one of each [[biome]] that the state possesses has been declared a wildlife reserve. Around 30% of the total land area of Suriname is protected by law as reserves.

Other attractions include plantations such as [[Laarwijk]], which is situated along the Suriname River. This plantation can be reached only by boat via Domburg, in the north central [[Wanica District]] of Suriname.

Crime rates continue to rise in Paramaribo and armed robberies are not uncommon. According to the current U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory at the date of the 2018 report's publication, Suriname has been assessed as Level 1: exercise normal precautions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osac.gov/Pages/ContentReportDetails.aspx?cid=23564|title=OSAC|year=2018|website=osac.gov}}</ref>

The [[Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge]] is a bridge over the river Suriname between Paramaribo and Meerzorg in the Commewijne district. The bridge was built during the tenure of President [[Jules Albert Wijdenbosch]] (1996–2000) and was completed in 2000. The bridge is {{convert|52|m|ft}} high, and {{convert|1504|m|ft}} long. It connects Paramaribo with Commewijne, a connection which previously could only be made by ferry. The purpose of the bridge was to facilitate and promote the development of the eastern part of Suriname. The bridge consists of two lanes (one lane each way) and is not accessible to pedestrians.

The construction of the [[Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral, Paramaribo|Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral]] started on 13 January 1883. Before it became a cathedral it was a theatre. The theatre was built in 1809 and burned down in 1820.

Suriname is one of the few countries in the world where [[Neveh Shalom Synagogue|a synagogue]] is located next to [[Mosque Keizerstraat|a mosque]].<ref>[https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-life-and-religion/187112/way-south-of-the-border Down Suriname Way, a Tiny Community of Jews Endures], ''[[Tablet (magazine)|Tablet]]'', 8 December 2014</ref>
The two buildings are located next to each other in the centre of Paramaribo and have been known to share a parking facility during their respective religious rites, should they happen to coincide with one another.

A relatively new landmark is the Hindu [[Arya Dewaker]] temple in the Johan Adolf Pengelstraat in [[Wanica]], Paramaribo, which was inaugurated in 2001. A special characteristic of the temple is that it does not have images of the Hindu divinities, as they are forbidden in the [[Arya Samaj]], the Hindu movement to which the people who built the temple belong. Instead, the building is covered by many texts derived from the Vedas and other Hindu scriptures. The beautiful architecture makes the temple a tourist attraction.

South Africa is a [[multiethnic society]] encompassing a wide [[Culture of South Africa|variety of cultures]], [[Languages of South Africa|languages]], and [[Religion in South Africa|religions]]. Its pluralistic makeup is reflected in the [[Constitution of South Africa|constitution]]'s recognition of 11 official languages, which is the fourth highest number in the world.<ref name=safacts /><ref name=safacts /> Two of these languages are of European origin: [[Afrikaans]] developed from [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and serves as the first language of most [[coloured]] and [[White South African|white]] South Africans; [[South African English|English]] reflects the legacy of [[British colonialism]], and is commonly used in public and commercial life, though it is fourth-ranked as a spoken [[first language]]. The country is one of the few in Africa never to have had a [[coup d'état]], and [[Elections in South Africa|regular elections]] have been held for almost a century. However, the vast majority of black South Africans were not [[enfranchised]] until 1994. During the 20th century, the black majority sought to recover its rights from the dominant white minority, with this struggle playing a large role in the country's recent [[History of South Africa|history]] and politics. The [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] imposed [[apartheid]] in 1948, institutionalising previous racial segregation. After a long and sometimes violent [[Internal resistance to apartheid|struggle]] by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and other anti-apartheid activists both inside and outside the country, the repeal of discriminatory laws began in 1990.

Since 1994, all ethnic and linguistic groups have held political representation in the country's [[liberal democracy]], which comprises a [[parliamentary republic]] and [[Provinces of South Africa|nine provinces]]. South Africa is often referred to as the "[[rainbow nation]]" to describe the country's multicultural diversity, especially in the wake of apartheid.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7512700.stm |title=Rainbow Nation – dream or reality? |accessdate=10 August 2013 | work=BBC News |date=18 July 2008}}</ref> The [[World Bank]] classifies South Africa as an upper-middle-income economy, and a [[newly industrialised country]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/south-africa |title=South Africa |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref><ref name="Waugh2000">{{cite book|author=David Waugh|title=Geography: An Integrated Approach|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GH0KZZthGoC|accessdate=24 August 2013|year=2000|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=978-0-17-444706-1|pages=563, 576–579, 633, 640|chapter=Manufacturing industries (chapter 19), World development (chapter 22)}}</ref> Its economy is the second-largest in Africa, and the 34th-largest in the world.<ref name=imf2 /> In terms of [[purchasing power parity]], South Africa has the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|seventh-highest per capita income]] in Africa.

== Name ==
{{See also|Official names of South Africa}}
The name "South Africa" is derived from the country's geographic location at the southern tip of Africa. Upon formation, the country was named the [[Union of South Africa]] in English, reflecting its origin from the unification of four formerly separate British colonies. Since 1961, the long form name in English has been the "Republic of South Africa". In Dutch, the country was named ''Republiek van Zuid-Afrika'', replaced in 1983 by the [[Afrikaans]] ''Republiek van Suid-Afrika''. Since 1994, the Republic has had an official name in each of its [[Languages of South Africa|11 official languages]].

''Mzansi'', derived from the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] noun ''umzantsi'' meaning "south", is a [[Colloquialism|colloquial name]] for South Africa,<ref>{{cite book|editor1-first=Sarah|editor2-first=Achille|last=Livermon|first=Xavier|title=Johannesburg: The Elusive Metropolis|chapter=Sounds in the City|year=2008|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham|isbn=978-0-8223-8121-1|page=283|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNONyzwm420C|quote=''Mzansi'' is another black urban vernacular term popular with the youth and standing for South Africa.|editor-last=Nuttall|editor2-last=Mbembé}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mzansi DiToloki |url=http://www.deafsa.co.za/mzansi_ditoloki/ |publisher=Deaf Federation of South Africa |accessdate=15 January 2014 |quote=uMzantsi in Xhosa means 'south', Mzansi means this country, South Africa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116135926/http://www.deafsa.co.za/mzansi_ditoloki/ |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df= }}</ref> while some [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] political parties prefer the term "[[Azania]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/south-african-party-says-call-it-azania/1855679.html|title=South African Party Says Call Their Country ‘Azania’|last=Taylor|first=Darren|newspaper=VOA|access-date=18 February 2017|language=en}}</ref>

=== Prehistoric archaeology ===
South Africa contains some of the oldest archaeological and [[human fossil|human-fossil]] sites in the world.<ref>{{cite book|last= Wymer|first= John|author2= Singer, R|year= 1982|title= The Middle Stone Age at Klasies River Mouth in South Africa|location= Chicago|publisher= University of Chicago Press|isbn= 978-0-226-76103-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Guide to Klasies River|page= 11|year= 2001|url= http://academic.sun.ac.za/archaeology/KRguide2001.PDF|author= Deacon, HJ|publisher= Stellenbosch University|accessdate= 5 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/915|title= Fossil Hominid Sites of Sterkfontein, Swartkrans, Kromdraai, and Environs }}</ref> Archaeologists have recovered extensive [[fossil]] remains from a series of caves in [[Gauteng Province]]. The area, a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]], has been branded "the [[Cradle of Humankind]]". The sites include [[Sterkfontein]], one of the richest sites for [[hominin]] fossils in the world. Other sites include [[Swartkrans]], [[Gondolin Cave]] [[Kromdraai]], [[Coopers Cave]] and [[Malapa]]. [[Raymond Dart]] identified the first hominin fossil discovered in Africa, the [[Taung Child]] (found near [[Taung]]) in 1924. Further hominin remains have come from the sites of [[Makapansgat]] in [[Limpopo|Limpopo Province]], [[Cornelia, Free State|Cornelia]] and [[Florisbad]] in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State Province]], [[Border Cave]] in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province]], [[Klasies River Mouth]] in [[Eastern Cape Province]] and [[Pinnacle Point]], [[Elandsfontein cranium|Elandsfontein]] and Die Kelders Cave in [[Western Cape Province]].

These finds suggest that various hominid species existed in South Africa from about three million years ago, starting with ''[[Australopithecus africanus]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1979/6/79.06.02.x.html|title= Hominid Evolution|publisher= Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute|author= Stephen P.

[[Modern humans]] have [[Pinnacle Point|inhabited Southern Africa]] for at least 170,000 years.

Settlements of [[Bantu-speaking peoples of South Africa|Bantu-speaking peoples]], who were iron-using [[agriculturists]] and [[herder|herdsmen]], were already present south of the [[Limpopo River]] (now the northern border with Botswana and Zimbabwe) by the 4th or 5th century [[Current Era|CE]] (see [[Bantu expansion]]). They displaced, conquered and absorbed the original [[Khoisan]] speakers, the [[Khoikhoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples. The Bantu slowly moved south. The earliest [[ironworks]] in modern-day KwaZulu-Natal Province are believed to date from around 1050. The southernmost group was the [[Xhosa people]], whose language incorporates certain linguistic traits from the earlier Khoisan people. The Xhosa reached the [[Great Fish River]], in today's Eastern Cape Province. As they migrated, these larger [[Iron Age]] populations displaced or assimilated earlier peoples.
In [[Mpumalanga|Mpumalanga Province]], several stone circles have been found along with the stone arrangement that has been named [[Adam's Calendar]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Portuguese contacts ===
At the time of European contact, the dominant ethnic group were Bantu-speaking peoples who had migrated from other parts of Africa about one thousand years before. The two major historic groups were the Xhosa and [[Zulu people]]s.<!-- estimated population? -->

In 1487, the Portuguese explorer [[Bartolomeu Dias]] led the first European voyage to land in southern Africa.<ref name=domville-25>{{cite book|last=Domville-Fife|first=C.W.|title=The encyclopedia of the British Empire the first encyclopedic record of the greatest empire in the history of the world ed|year=1900|publisher=Rankin|location=London|page=25|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopediaofbr01domvuoft#page/24/mode/2up}}</ref> On 4 December, he landed at [[Walfisch Bay]] (now known as [[Walvis Bay]] in present-day Namibia). This was south of the furthest point reached in 1485 by his predecessor, the Portuguese navigator [[Diogo Cão]] ([[Cape Cross]], north of the bay). Dias continued down the western coast of southern Africa. After 8 January 1488, prevented by storms from proceeding along the coast, he sailed out of sight of land and passed the southernmost point of Africa without seeing it. He reached as far up the eastern coast of Africa as, what he called, ''Rio do Infante'', probably the present-day [[Groot River (Eastern Cape)|Groot River]], in May 1488, but on his return he saw the Cape, which he first named ''Cabo das Tormentas'' (Cape of Storms). His King, [[John II of Portugal|John II]], renamed the point ''Cabo da Boa Esperança'', or [[Cape of Good Hope]], as it led to the riches of the [[East Indies]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mackenzie |first1=W.

During the early 1800s, many Dutch settlers departed from the [[Cape Colony]], where they had been subjected to British control. They migrated to the future [[Natal (province)|Natal]], [[Orange Free State]], and [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] regions. The Boers founded the [[Boer Republics]]: the [[South African Republic]] (now Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and [[North West Province (South Africa)|North West]] provinces), the [[Natalia Republic]] (KwaZulu-Natal), and the Orange Free State (Free State).

The discovery of diamonds in 1867 and gold in 1884 in the interior started the [[Mineral Revolution]] and increased economic growth and [[immigration]]. This intensified British efforts to gain control over the indigenous peoples. The struggle to control these important economic resources was a factor in relations between Europeans and the indigenous population and also between the Boers and the British.<ref>{{cite book|author=Williams, Garner F|title=The Diamond Mines of South Africa, Vol II|year=1905|publisher=B.

The [[Anglo-Zulu War]] was fought in 1879 between the British Empire and the Zulu Kingdom. Following [[Lord Carnarvon]]'s successful introduction of [[Canadian Confederation|federation in Canada]], it was thought that similar political effort, coupled with military campaigns, might succeed with the African kingdoms, tribal areas and Boer republics in South Africa. In 1874, Sir [[Henry Bartle Frere]] was sent to South Africa as [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa|High Commissioner]] for the British Empire to bring such plans into being. Among the obstacles were the presence of the independent states of the Boers and the [[Zulu Kingdom|Kingdom of Zululand]] and its army. The Zulu nation defeated the British at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]]. Eventually, though, the war was lost, resulting in the termination of the Zulu nation's independence.

[[File:Boers 1881.gif|thumb|[[Boer]]s in combat (1881)]]
The [[Boer Republics]] successfully resisted British encroachments during the [[First Boer War]] (1880–1881) using [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics, which were well suited to local conditions. The British returned with greater numbers, more experience, and new strategy in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) but suffered heavy casualties through [[Attrition warfare|attrition]]; nonetheless, they were ultimately successful.

==== Independence ====
Within the country, anti-British policies among white South Africans focused on independence. During the Dutch and British colonial years, [[racial segregation]] was mostly informal, though some legislation was enacted to control the settlement and movement of native people, including the [[Native Location Act of 1879]] and the system of [[pass laws]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Bond|first=Patrick|title=Cities of gold, townships of coal: essays on South Africa's new urban crisis|publisher=Africa World Press|year=1999|page=140|isbn=978-0-86543-611-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Cape of Good Hope (South Africa).

Eight years after the end of the Second Boer War and after four years of negotiation, an act of the British Parliament ([[South Africa Act 1909]]) granted nominal independence, while creating the [[Union of South Africa]] on 31 May 1910. The Union was a [[dominion]] that included the former territories of the [[Cape Colony|Cape]], [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] and [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] colonies, as well as the Orange Free State republic.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|first=Frank Richardson |last=Cana |wstitle=South Africa |volume=25 |page=467}}</ref>

The [[Natives' Land Act]] of 1913 severely restricted the ownership of land by blacks; at that stage natives controlled only 7% of the country. The amount of land reserved for [[indigenous peoples]] was later marginally increased.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1913-06-19.htm |title=Native Land Act |publisher=South African Institute of Race Relations |date=19 June 1913 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014095049/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1913-06-19.htm |archivedate=14 October 2010 }}</ref>

In 1931, the union was fully sovereign from the United Kingdom with the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], which abolished the last powers of the [[British Government]] on the country. In 1934, the [[South African Party]] and [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] merged to form the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], seeking reconciliation between Afrikaners and English-speaking whites. In 1939, the party split over the entry of the Union into [[World War II]] as an [[Military history of South Africa during World War II|ally of the United Kingdom]], a move which the National Party followers strongly opposed.

==== Beginning of apartheid ====
[[File:ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg|thumb|"For use by white persons"&nbsp;– apartheid sign in English and [[Afrikaans]]]]
In 1948, the National Party was elected to power. It strengthened the racial segregation begun under Dutch and British colonial rule. Taking [[Canada]]'s [[Indian Act]] as a framework,<ref>Gloria Galloway, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/chiefs-reflect-on-apartheid-and-first-nations-as-atleo-visits-mandela-memorial/article15902124/ "Chieft Reflect on Apartheid"], ''The Globe and Mail'', 11 December 2013</ref> the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] government classified all peoples into three races and developed rights and limitations for each. The white minority (less than 20%)<ref>Beinart, William (2001). ''Twentieth-century South Africa.'' Oxford University Press. p. 202. {{ISBN|978-0-19-289318-5}}.</ref> controlled the vastly larger black majority. The legally institutionalized segregation became known as ''[[apartheid]]''. While whites enjoyed the highest [[standard of living]] in all of Africa, comparable to [[First World]] Western nations, the black majority remained disadvantaged by almost every standard, including income, education, housing, and life expectancy. The [[Freedom Charter]], adopted in 1955 by the [[Congress Alliance]], demanded a non-racial society and an end to discrimination.

=== Republic ===
On 31 May 1961, the country became a [[republic]] following [[South African republic referendum, 1960|a referendum]] in which white voters narrowly voted in favour thereof (the British-dominated [[Natal Province|Natal]] province rallied against the issue).<ref>{{cite web|title=Hendrik Frensch Verwoerd|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/people/hendrik-frensch-verwoerd|publisher=South African History Online|quote=On 5 October 1960 a referendum was held in which White voters were asked "Do you support a republic for the Union?" – 52 percent voted 'Yes'.|accessdate=9 March 2013}}</ref> [[Queen Elizabeth II]] was stripped of the title [[Queen of South Africa]], and the last [[Governor-General of the Union of South Africa|Governor-General]], [[Charles Robberts Swart]], became [[State President of South Africa|State President]]. As a concession to the [[Westminster system]], the presidency remained parliamentary-appointed and virtually powerless until [[P. W. Botha]]'s [[South African Constitution of 1983|Constitution Act of 1983]], which eliminated the office of [[Prime Minister of South Africa|Prime Minister]] and instated a near-unique "strong presidency" [[parliamentarianism|responsible to parliament]]. Pressured by other [[Commonwealth of Nations]] countries, South Africa withdrew from the organisation in 1961, and rejoined it only in 1994.

Despite [[Internal resistance to apartheid|opposition]] both within and outside the country, the government legislated for a continuation of apartheid. The security forces cracked down on internal dissent, and violence became widespread, with anti-apartheid organisations such as the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), the [[Azanian People's Organisation]] (AZAPO), and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania|Pan-Africanist Congress]] (PAC) carrying out guerrilla warfare<ref name="Biko1">{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=Nigel|last2=Alexander|first2=Amanda|last3=Mngxitama|first3=Andile|title=Biko Lives!

==== End of apartheid ====
The [[Mahlabatini Declaration]] of Faith, signed by [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi]] and [[Harry Schwarz]] in 1974, enshrined the principles of peaceful transition of power and equality for all, the first of such agreements by black and white political leaders in South Africa. Ultimately, [[F. W. de Klerk|FW de Klerk]] opened bilateral discussions with [[Nelson Mandela]] in 1993 for a transition of policies and government.

In 1990, the National Party government took the first step towards dismantling discrimination when it lifted the ban on the ANC and other political organisations. It released Nelson Mandela from prison after 27 years' serving a sentence for sabotage. A [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiation process]] followed. With approval from the white electorate in a [[South African apartheid referendum, 1992|1992 referendum]], the government continued negotiations to end apartheid. South Africa also destroyed its nuclear arsenal and acceded to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. South Africa held its first universal [[South African general election, 1994|elections in 1994]], which the ANC won by an overwhelming majority. It has been in power ever since. The country rejoined the Commonwealth of Nations and became a member of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).

[[Mafadi]] in the [[Drakensberg]] at {{convert|abbr=on|3450|m|ft}} is the highest peak in South Africa. Excluding the [[Prince Edward Islands]], the country lies between latitudes [[22nd parallel south|22°]] and [[35th parallel south|35°S]], and longitudes [[16th meridian east|16°]] and [[33rd meridian east|33°E]].

The interior of South Africa consists of a vast, in most places almost flat, plateau with an altitude of between {{convert|abbr=on|1000|m|ft}} and {{convert|abbr=on|2100|m|ft}}, highest in the east and sloping gently downwards towards the west and north, and slightly less noticeably so to the south and south-west.<ref>McCarthy, T. & Rubidge, B.

Readers Digest Association, Cape Town</ref> whose eastern, and highest, stretch is known as the [[Drakensberg]].<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica (1975); Micropaedia Vol. III, p. 655. Helen Hemingway Benton Publishers, Chicago.</ref>

The south and south-western parts of the plateau (at approximately 1100{{ndash}}1800{{nbsp}}m above sea level), and the adjoining plain below (at approximately 700{{ndash}}800{{nbsp}}m above sea level{{snds}}see map on the right) is known as the [[Karoo|Great Karoo]], which consists of sparsely populated [[scrubland]]. To the north the Great Karoo fades into the even drier and more arid Bushmanland, which eventually becomes the [[Kalahari]] desert in the very north-west of the country. The mid-eastern, and highest part of the plateau is known as the [[Highveld]]. This relatively well-watered area is home to a great proportion of the country's commercial farmlands, and contains its largest conurbation (Gauteng). To the north of Highveld, from about the 25°{{nbsp}}30'{{nbsp}}S line of latitude, the plateau slopes downwards into the [[Bushveld]], which ultimately gives way to the Limpopo lowlands or [[Veld#Highveld and Lowveld|Lowveld]].<ref name="Altas" />
[[File:Karoo Koppies.png|thumb|left|upright=2|Flat topped hills (called Karoo ''Koppies'') are highly characteristic of the southern and southwestern [[Karoo]] landscape. These hills are capped by hard, erosion resistant [[dolerite]] [[Sill (geology)|sills]]. This is solidified lava that was forced under high pressure between the horizontal [[Stratum|strata]] of the [[sedimentary rock]]s that make up most of the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo's geology]] about 180{{nbsp}}million years ago. Since then, Southern Africa has undergone a prolonged period of erosion removing the relatively soft Karoo rocks, except where they are protected by a cap of dolerite. This photograph was taken near [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]] in the Eastern Cape]]

The coastal belt, below the Great Escarpment, moving clockwise from the northeast, consists of the Limpopo Lowveld, which merges into the Mpumalanga Lowveld, below the Mpumalanga Drakensberg (the eastern portion of the Great Escarpment).<ref>Atlas of Southern Africa. (1984). p. 186. Readers Digest Association, Cape Town</ref> This is hotter, drier and less intensely cultivated than the Highveld above the escarpment.<ref name="Altas" /> The [[Kruger National Park]], located in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga in northeastern South Africa, occupies a large portion of the Lowveld covering 19,633 square kilometres (7,580 sq mi.) <ref name="Kruger National Park">{{cite web|title=Kruger National Park |url=http://www.africa.com/south-africa/travel/what-to-do/ |publisher=Africa.com |accessdate=16 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218164142/http://www.africa.com/south-africa/travel/what-to-do/ |archivedate=18 December 2014 |df= }}</ref> South of the Lowveld the annual rainfall increases as one enters KwaZulu-Natal Province, which, especially near the coast, is [[Subtropics|subtropically]] hot and humid.

The coastal belt below the south and south-western stretches of the Great Escarpment contains several ranges of [[Cape Fold Belt|Cape Fold Mountains]] which run parallel to the coast, separating the Great Escarpment from the ocean.<ref>McCarthy, T. & Rubidge, B. (2005). ''The story of earth and life''. p. 194. Struik Publishers, Cape Town.</ref><ref name="geological map">Geological map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (1970). Council for Geoscience, Geological Survey of South Africa.</ref> (These parallel ranges of fold mountains are shown on the map, above left. Note the course of the Great Escarpment to the north of these mountain ranges.) The land (at approximately 400{{ndash}}500{{nbsp}}m above sea level) between two of these ranges of fold mountains in the south (i.e. between the [[Outeniqua Mountains|Outeniqua]] and [[Langeberg]] ranges to the south and the [[Swartberg]] range to the north) is known as the [[Karoo|Little Karoo]],<ref name="Altas" /> which consists of semi-desert scrubland similar to that of the Great Karoo, except that its northern strip along the foothills of the Swartberg Mountains, has a somewhat higher rainfall and is therefore more cultivated than the Great Karoo. The Little Karoo is historically, and still, famous for its [[ostrich]] farming around the town of [[Oudtshoorn]]. The lowland area (700{{ndash}}800{{nbsp}}m above sea level) to the north of the Swartberg mountain range up to the Great Escarpment is the lowland part of the Great Karoo (see map at top right), which is climatically and botanically almost indistinguishable from the Karoo above the Great Escarpment. The narrow coastal strip between the most seaward Cape Fold Mountain range (i.e., the Langeberg{{ndash}}Outeniqua mountains) and the ocean has a moderately high year-round rainfall, especially in the [[George, Western Cape|George]]-[[Knysna]]-[[Plettenberg Bay]] region, which is known as the [[Garden Route]]. It is famous for the most extensive areas of indigenous forests in South Africa (a generally forest-poor country).

In the south-west corner of the country, the [[Cape Peninsula]] forms the southernmost tip of the coastal strip which borders the Atlantic Ocean, and ultimately terminates at the country's border with Namibia at the [[Orange River]]. The [[Cape Peninsula]] has a [[Mediterranean climate]], making it and its immediate surrounds the only portion of [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Africa south of the Sahara]] which receives most of its rainfall in winter.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica (1975); Micropaedia Vol. VI, p. 750.

The coastal belt to the north of the Cape Peninsula is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean and the first row of north-south running Cape Fold Mountains to the east. The Cape Fold Mountains peter out at about the 32°{{nbsp}}S line of latitude,<ref name="geological map" /> after which the coastal plain is bounded by the Great Escarpment itself. The most southerly portion of this coastal belt is known as the [[Swartland]] and Malmesbury Plain, which is an important wheat growing region, relying on winter rains. The region further north is known as [[Namaqualand]],<ref>Atlas of Southern Africa. (1984). p. 113. Readers Digest Association, Cape Town</ref> which becomes more and more arid as one approaches the [[Orange River]]. The little rain that falls tends to fall in winter,<ref name="Altas1" /> which results in one of the world's most spectacular displays of flowers carpeting huge stretches of ''[[veld]]'' in spring (August{{ndash}}September).

South Africa also has one possession, the small [[Subantarctic|sub-Antarctic]] [[archipelago]] of the Prince Edward Islands, consisting of [[Marion Island]] ({{convert|abbr=on|290|km2|sqmi|disp=or}}) and Prince Edward Island ({{convert|abbr=on|45|km2|sqmi|disp=or}}) (not to be confused with the [[Prince Edward Island|Canadian province of the same name]]).

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of South Africa}}
[[File:South Africa Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of South Africa]]
South Africa has a generally [[temperate climate]], due in part to being surrounded by the Atlantic and Indian Oceans on three sides, by its location in the climatically milder [[Southern Hemisphere]] and due to the average elevation rising steadily towards the north (towards the [[equator]]) and further inland. Due to this varied topography and oceanic influence, a great variety of climatic zones exist. The climatic zones range from the extreme desert of the southern [[Namib Desert|Namib]] in the farthest northwest to the lush subtropical climate in the east along the border with Mozambique and the Indian Ocean. Winters in South Africa occur between June and August.

The extreme southwest has a climate remarkably similar to that of the Mediterranean with wet winters and hot, dry summers, hosting the famous [[fynbos]] [[biome]] of [[shrubland]] and [[Albany thickets|thicket]]. This area also produces much of the wine in South Africa. This region is also particularly known for its wind, which blows intermittently almost all year. The severity of this wind made passing around the Cape of Good Hope particularly treacherous for sailors, causing many shipwrecks. Further east on the south coast, rainfall is distributed more evenly throughout the year, producing a green landscape. This area is popularly known as the [[Garden Route]].

The Free State is particularly flat because it lies centrally on the high plateau. North of the [[Vaal River]], the Highveld becomes better watered and does not experience subtropical extremes of heat. Johannesburg, in the centre of the Highveld, is at {{convert|abbr=on|1740|m|ft|0}} above sea level and receives an annual rainfall of {{convert|abbr=on|760|mm|in|1}}. Winters in this region are cold, although snow is rare.

The high Drakensberg mountains, which form the south-eastern escarpment of the Highveld, offer limited skiing opportunities in winter. The coldest place on mainland South Africa is [[Sutherland, Northern Cape|Sutherland]] in the western [[Roggeveld Mountains]], where midwinter temperatures can reach as low as {{convert|abbr=on|-15|C|F}}. The Prince Edward Islands have colder average annual temperatures, but Sutherland has colder extremes. The deep interior of mainland South Africa has the hottest temperatures: a temperature of {{convert|abbr=on|51.7|C|F|2}} was recorded in 1948 in the Northern Cape Kalahari near [[Upington, Northern Cape|Upington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.safrica.info/about/geography/geography.htm |title=South Africa's geography |publisher=Safrica.info |accessdate=30 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608121736/http://www.safrica.info/about/geography/geography.htm |archivedate=8 June 2010 |df= }}</ref> but this temperature is unofficial and was not recorded with standard equipment, the official highest temperature is {{convert|abbr=on|48.8|C|F|2}} at [[Vioolsdrif]] in January 1993.<ref>{{cite book|title=South Africa yearbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMdzAAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=South African Communication Service|page=3}}</ref>

With more than 22,000 different [[higher plants]], or about 9% of all the known species of plants on Earth,<ref>{{cite book|author1=Marco Lambertini|title=A Anturalist's Guide to the Tropics|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-46828-0|page=46|edition=Revised edition (May 15, 2000)|language=English|chapter=The Flora / The Richest Botany in the World|date=2000-05-15}}</ref> South Africa is particularly rich in plant diversity. The most prevalent biome in South Africa is the [[grassland]], particularly on the Highveld, where the plant cover is dominated by different [[Poaceae|grasses]], low [[shrub]]s, and [[acacia tree]]s, mainly [[Camelthorn tree|camel-thorn]] (''Vachellia erioloba'') and [[Whitethorn acacia|whitethorn]] (''V. constricta''). Vegetation becomes even more sparse towards the northwest due to low [[precipitation (meteorology)|rainfall]]. There are several species of water-storing [[Succulent plant|succulents]], like [[aloe]]s and [[euphorbias]], in the very hot and dry Namaqualand area. The grass and thorn [[savannah]] turns slowly into a bush savannah towards the north-east of the country, with denser growth. There are significant numbers of [[baobab]] trees in this area, near the northern end of Kruger National Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica-travel.net/pages/e_plants.htm |title=Plants and Vegetation in South Africa |publisher=Southafrica-travel.net |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

The [[fynbos]] biome, which makes up the majority of the area and plant life in the [[Cape floristic region]], one of the six [[floral kingdom]]s, is located in a small region of the Western Cape and contains more than 9,000 of those species, making it among the richest regions on earth in terms of plant diversity.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Most of the plants are [[evergreen]] hard-leaf plants with fine, needle-like leaves, such as the [[sclerophyllous]] plants. Another uniquely South African flowering plant group is the genus ''[[Protea]]''. There are around 130 different species of Protea in South Africa.

While South Africa has a great wealth of flowering plants, only 1% of South Africa is forest, almost exclusively in the humid [[KwaZulu-Cape coastal forest mosaic|coastal plain of KwaZulu-Natal]], where there are also areas of [[Southern Africa mangroves]] in river mouths. There are even smaller reserves of forests that are out of the reach of fire, known as [[Knysna-Amatole montane forests|montane forests]]. Plantations of imported tree species are predominant, particularly the non-native [[eucalyptus]] and [[pine]].

=== Conservation issues ===
South Africa has lost a large area of natural habitat in the last four decades, primarily due to overpopulation, sprawling development patterns and deforestation during the 19th century. South Africa is one of the worst affected countries in the world when it comes to invasion by [[alien species]] with many (e.g., [[Acacia mearnsii|black wattle]], [[Acacia saligna|Port Jackson willow]], ''[[Hakea]]'', ''[[Lantana]]'' and ''[[Jacaranda]]'') posing a significant threat to the native biodiversity and the already scarce water resources.

[[Climate change]] is expected to bring considerable warming and drying to much of this already [[semi-arid region]], with greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as [[heat wave]]s, flooding and drought. According to computer-generated [[climate modelling]] produced by the South African National Biodiversity Institute,<ref name="SANBI">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanbi.org/ |title=South African National Biodiversity Institute |publisher=Sanbi.org |date=30 September 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref> parts of southern Africa will see an increase in temperature by about {{Convert|1|C-change|}} along the coast to more than {{Convert|4|C-change|}} in the already hot [[hinterland]] such as the Northern Cape in late spring and summertime by 2050. The [[Cape Floral Kingdom]], being identified as one of the global [[biodiversity hotspots]], will be hit very hard by climate change. Drought, increased intensity and frequency of fire, and climbing temperatures are expected to push many rare species towards extinction.

[[File:Houses of Parliament (Cape Town).jpg|thumb|Houses of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] in Cape Town, seat of the [[legislature]]]]
South Africa is a [[parliamentary republic]], although unlike most such republics the [[President of South Africa|President]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and depends for his tenure on the [[Confidence and supply|confidence]] of [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]]. The executive, legislature and judiciary are all subject to the supremacy of the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]], and the [[Courts of South Africa|superior courts]] have the power to strike down executive actions and acts of Parliament if they are unconstitutional.

The [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]], the lower house of Parliament, consists of 400 members and is elected every five years by a system of [[party-list proportional representation]]. The [[National Council of Provinces]], the upper house, consists of ninety members, with each of the nine [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|provincial legislatures]] electing ten members.

After each parliamentary election, the National Assembly elects one of its members as President; hence the President serves a term of office the same as that of the Assembly, normally five years. No President may serve more than two terms in office.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/6772433 |title=Term Limits in Africa |work=The Economist |date=6 April 2006 |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref> The President appoints a [[Deputy President of South Africa|Deputy President]] and [[Minister (government)|Ministers]], who form the [[Cabinet of South Africa|Cabinet]] which consists of [[Departmentalization|Departments]] and [[Ministry (government department)|Ministries]]. The President and the Cabinet may be removed by the National Assembly by a [[motion of no confidence]].

In the [[South African general election, 2014|most recent election]], held on 7 May 2014, the ANC won 62.2% of the vote and 249 seats, while the main opposition, the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]] (DA) won 22.2% of the vote and 89 seats. The [[Economic Freedom Fighters]] (EFF), founded by [[Julius Malema]], the former President of the ANC's Youth Wing ([[ANC Youth League]]) who was later expelled from the ANC, won 6.4% of the vote and 25 seats. The ANC has been the governing political party in South Africa since the end of [[apartheid]].

It was imported before the [[Codification (law)|codification]] of European law into the [[Napoleonic Code]] and is comparable in many ways to [[Scots law]]. This was followed in the 19th century by [[English law]], both [[Common law|common]] and [[Statutory law|statutory]]. After unification in 1910, South Africa had its own parliament which passed laws specific for South Africa, building on those previously passed for the individual member colonies.

The judicial system consists of the [[Magistrates' Courts of South Africa|magistrates' courts]], which hear lesser criminal cases and smaller civil cases; the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]], which has divisions that serve as the courts of [[general jurisdiction]] for specific areas; the [[Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa|Supreme Court of Appeal]], and the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]], which is the highest court.

Each of the nine provinces is governed by a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[provincial legislature (South Africa)|legislature]], which is elected every five years by [[party-list proportional representation]]. The legislature elects a [[Premier (South Africa)|Premier]] as head of government, and the Premier appoints an [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Executive Council]] as a provincial cabinet. The powers of provincial governments are limited to topics listed in the [[Constitution of South Africa|Constitution]]; these topics include such fields as health, education, public housing and transport.

The provinces are in turn divided into 52 [[Districts of South Africa|districts]]: 8 [[Metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|metropolitan]] and 44 [[District municipality (South Africa)|district municipalities]]. The district municipalities are further subdivided into 226 [[Local municipality (South Africa)|local municipalities]]. The metropolitan municipalities, which govern the largest urban agglomerations, perform the functions of both district and local municipalities.

South Africa has a [[mixed economy]], the second largest in Africa after [[Nigeria]]. It also has a relatively high [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) per capita compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa (US$11,750 at [[purchasing power parity]] as of 2012). Despite this, South Africa is still burdened by a relatively high rate of poverty and unemployment, and is also ranked in the top ten countries in the world for [[income inequality]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/161.html |title=Inequality in income or expenditure / Gini index, Human Development Report 2007/08 |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org |date=4 November 2010 |accessdate=26 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116234423/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/indicators/161.html |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2172.html |title=Distribution of family income – Gini index |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=26 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/business/business-news/south-africa-has-widest-gap-between-rich-and-poor-1.707558 |title=South Africa has highest gap between rich and poor |publisher=Business Report |date=28 September 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023162404/http://www.iol.co.za/business/business-news/south-africa-has-widest-gap-between-rich-and-poor-1.707558 |archivedate=23 October 2011 }}</ref> measured by the [[Gini coefficient]].

=== Science and technology ===
{{Main|Science and technology in South Africa}}
[[File:Mark Shuttleworth NASA.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Shuttleworth]] in space]]
Several important scientific and technological developments have originated in South Africa. The first human-to-human [[Heart transplantation|heart transplant]] was performed by cardiac surgeon [[Christiaan Barnard]] at [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] in December 1967, [[Max Theiler]] developed a [[Yellow fever vaccine|vaccine]] against [[yellow fever]], [[Allan McLeod Cormack]] pioneered [[X-ray computed tomography]] (CT scan), and [[Aaron Klug]] developed [[crystallographic electron microscopy]] techniques. With the exception of that of Barnard, all of these advancements were recognised with [[Nobel Prize]]s. [[Sydney Brenner]] won most recently, in 2002, for his pioneering work in [[molecular biology]].

[[Mark Shuttleworth]] founded an early Internet security company [[Thawte]], that was subsequently bought out by world-leader [[VeriSign]]. Despite government efforts to encourage entrepreneurship in [[biotechnology]], information technology and other high technology fields, no other notable groundbreaking companies have been founded in South Africa. It is the expressed objective of the government to transition the economy to be more reliant on high technology, based on the realisation that South Africa cannot compete with [[Far East]]ern economies in manufacturing, nor can the republic rely on its mineral wealth in perpetuity.

South Africa has cultivated a burgeoning [[astronomy]] community. It hosts the [[Southern African Large Telescope]], the largest [[optical telescope]] in the Southern Hemisphere. South Africa is currently building the [[Karoo Array Telescope]] as a pathfinder for the €1.5&nbsp;billion [[Square Kilometre Array]] project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skatelescope.org/news/2nd-april-news/|title=SKA announces Founding Board and selects Jodrell Bank Observatory to host Project Office|publisher=SKA 2011|date=2 April 2011|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> On 25 May 2012, it was announced that hosting of the Square Kilometer Array Telescope will be split over both the South African and the Australia and New Zealand sites.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18194984 | title=Africa and Australasia to share Square Kilometre Array | publisher=BBC | date=25 May 2012}}</ref>

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in South Africa}}
Two distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of [[Water Board (South Africa)|water boards]], which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities. These features have led to significant problems concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance. Following the end of apartheid, the country had made improvements in the levels of access to water as those with access increased from 66% to 79% from 1990 to 2010.<ref name="JMP">[[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]]:[[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]]:[http://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/table/ Data table South Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209002836/http://www.wssinfo.org/data-estimates/table/ |date= 9 February 2014 }}, 2010.

[[Statistics South Africa]] asks people to describe themselves in the census in terms of five [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] population groups.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lehohla |first=Pali |title=Debate over race and censuses not peculiar to SA |url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/news_archive/05may2005_1.asp |date=5 May 2005 |newspaper=Business Report |accessdate=25 August 2013 |quote=Others pointed out that the repeal of the Population Registration Act in 1991 removed any legal basis for specifying 'race'. The Identification Act of 1997 makes no mention of race. On the other hand, the Employment Equity Act speaks of 'designated groups' being 'black people, women and people with disabilities'. The Act defines 'black' as referring to 'Africans, coloureds and Indians'. Apartheid and the racial identification which underpinned it explicitly linked race with differential access to resources and power. If the post-apartheid order was committed to remedying this, race would have to be included in surveys and censuses, so that progress in eradicating the consequences of apartheid could be measured and monitored. This was the reasoning that led to a 'self-identifying' question about 'race' or 'population group' in both the 1996 and 2001 population censuses, and in Statistics SA's household survey programme. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814143522/http://www.statssa.gov.za/news_archive/05may2005_1.asp |archivedate=14 August 2007 |df= }}</ref> The 2011 census figures for these groups were: [[Black (people)|Black African]] at 79.2%, [[White South African|White]] at 8.9%, [[Coloured]] at 8.9%, [[Asian South African|Asian]] at 2.5%, and Other/Unspecified at 0.5%.<ref name=cib11/>{{rp|21}} The first census in South Africa in 1911 showed that whites made up 22% of the population; this had declined to 16% by 1980.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Study Commission on U.S. Policy toward Southern Africa (U.S.) | title = South Africa: time running out: the report of the Study Commission on U.S. Policy Toward Southern Africa | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sq43lnbklEUC&pg=PA42| publisher=University of California Press | year = 1981 | page = 42 | isbn = 978-0-520-04547-7}}</ref>

In this regard it is fourth only to [[Bolivia]], [[Official languages of India|India]], and [[Zimbabwe]] in number. While all the languages are formally equal, some languages are spoken more than others.

The country also recognises several unofficial languages, including [[Fanagalo language|Fanagalo]], [[Khoe language|Khoe]], [[Lobedu language|Lobedu]], [[Nama language|Nama]], [[Northern Ndebele language|Northern Ndebele]], [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], and [[South African Sign Language]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/people/language.htm |title=The languages of South Africa |publisher=SouthAfrica.info |date=4 February 1997 |accessdate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304001836/http://www.southafrica.info/about/people/language.htm |archivedate=4 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These unofficial languages may be used in certain official uses in limited areas where it has been determined that these languages are prevalent.

Many of the unofficial [[Khoisan languages|languages of the San and Khoikhoi]] people contain regional dialects stretching northwards into Namibia and Botswana, and elsewhere. These people, who are a physically distinct population from other Africans, have their own cultural identity based on their [[hunter-gatherer]] societies. They have been marginalised to a great extent, and the remainder of their languages are in danger of becoming [[Extinct language|extinct]].

White South Africans may also speak [[European languages]], including [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] (also spoken by black [[Angola]]ns and [[Mozambique|Mozambicans]]), [[German language|German]], and [[Greek language|Greek]], while some Indian South Africans speak [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], such as [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], and [[Urdu language|Urdu]]. [[French language|French]] is spoken in South Africa by migrants from [[Francophone Africa]].

According to the 2001 census, Christians accounted for 79.8% of the population, with a majority of them being members of various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denominations]] (broadly defined to include [[Syncretism|syncretic]] [[African initiated churches]]) and a minority of [[Roman Catholics]] and other Christians.

African initiated churches formed the largest of the Christian groups. It was believed that many of the persons who claimed no affiliation with any organised religion adhered to [[traditional African religion]]. There are an estimated 200,000 [[Traditional healers of South Africa|indigenous traditional healers]] in South Africa, and up to 60% of South Africans consult these healers,<ref>{{cite book|author=van Wyk, Ben-Erik and van Oudtshoorn, Gericke N|year=1999|title=Medicinal Plants of South Africa|location=Pretoria|publisher=Briza Publications|isbn=978-1-875093-37-3|page=10}}</ref> generally called ''sangomas'' or ''inyangas''. These healers use a combination of [[Veneration of the dead|ancestral spiritual beliefs]] and a belief in the spiritual and medicinal properties of local fauna and flora, commonly known as [[Traditional African medicine|''muti'']], to facilitate healing in clients.

South Africa is also home to a substantial [[History of the Jews in South Africa|Jewish population]], descended from [[History of the Jews in Europe|European Jews]] who arrived as a minority among other European settlers. This population peaked in the 1970s at 120,000, though only around 67,000 remain today, the rest having emigrated, mostly to [[Israel]]. Even so, these numbers make the Jewish community in South Africa the twelfth largest in the world.<ref>{{Citation | editor-last = Rebecca Weiner | editor-first = Rebecca Weiner |year=2010 | publisher = [[Jewish Virtual Library]] | title = South African Jewish History and Information | format = PDF | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/South_Africa.html | accessdate = 13 August 2010 }}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of South Africa}}
[[File:SouthAfricaDecoratedHouses.jpg|thumb|Decorated houses, [[Drakensberg]]]]
The South African black majority still has a substantial number of rural inhabitants who lead largely impoverished lives. It is among these people that cultural traditions survive most strongly; as blacks have become increasingly urbanised and [[Western world|Westernised]], aspects of traditional culture have declined. Members of the middle class, who are predominantly white but whose ranks include growing numbers of black, coloured and Indian people,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/default/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&ArticleID=1518-25_2117122 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822120841/http://www.fin24.co.za/articles/default/display_article.aspx?Nav=ns&ArticleID=1518-25_2117122 |archivedate=22 August 2007 |title=Black middle class explodes |date=22 May 2007 |publisher=FIN24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> have lifestyles similar in many respects to that of people found in Western Europe, North America and [[Australasia]].

=== Arts ===
[[File:San Painting, Ukalamba Drakensberge 1.JPG|thumb|[[Rock painting]] of an [[Common eland|eland]], [[Drakensberg]]]]
[[South African art]] includes the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered in a South African cave, and dated from 75,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/16/artsandhumanities.arts |title=World's Oldest Jewellery Found in Cave |publisher=Buzzle.com |accessdate=16 April 2011 |location=London |first=Tim |last=Radford |date=16 April 2004}}</ref>
The scattered tribes of [[Khoisan]] peoples moving into South Africa from around 10000 BC had their own fluent art styles seen today in a multitude of cave paintings. They were superseded by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]]/[[Nguni people]]s with their own vocabularies of art forms. New forms of art evolved in the mines and townships: a dynamic art using everything from plastic strips to bicycle spokes. The Dutch-influenced folk art of the Afrikaner [[Trekboer|''trekboers'']] and the urban white artists, earnestly following changing European traditions from the 1850s onwards, also contributed to this eclectic mix which continues to evolve today.

[[File:Olive Schreiner.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Olive Schreiner]]]]
[[South African literature]] emerged from a unique social and political history. One of the first well known novels written by a black author in an African language was [[Sol Plaatje|Solomon Thekiso Plaatje]]'s ''[[Mhudi]]'', written in 1930. During the 1950s, ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' magazine became a hotbed of political satire, fiction, and essays, giving a voice to urban black culture.

Notable white South African authors include [[Alan Paton]], who published the novel ''[[Cry, the Beloved Country]]'' in 1948. [[Nadine Gordimer]] became the first South African to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]], in 1991. [[J. M. Coetzee|JM Coetzee]] won the Nobel Prize for Literature, in 2003. When awarding the prize, the [[Swedish Academy]] stated that Coetzee "in innumerable guises portrays the surprising involvement of the outsider."<ref name="Swedish Academy">{{cite news|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2003/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature: John Maxwell Coetzee|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Swedish Academy|accessdate=2 August 2009}}</ref>

The plays of [[Athol Fugard]] have been regularly premiered in [[fringe theatre]]s in South Africa, London ([[Royal Court Theatre]]) and New York. [[Olive Schreiner]]'s ''[[The Story of an African Farm]]'' (1883) was a revelation in [[Victorian literature]]: it is heralded by many as introducing feminism into the novel form.

[[Breyten Breytenbach]] was jailed for his involvement with the guerrilla movement against apartheid. [[André Brink]] was the first Afrikaner writer to be [[banned book|banned]] by the government after he released the novel ''[[A Dry White Season]]''.

=== Popular culture ===
The [[Media of South Africa|South African media]] sector is large, and South Africa is one of Africa's major media centres. While South Africa's many broadcasters and publications reflect the diversity of the population as a whole, the most commonly used language is English. However, all ten other official languages are represented to some extent or another.

There is great diversity in [[Music of South Africa|South African music]]. Black musicians have developed a unique style called [[Kwaito]], that is said to have taken over radio, television, and magazines.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2822/is_3_28/ai_n15648564/pg_5 |title=South African music after Apartheid: kwaito, the "party politic," and the appropriation of gold as a sign of success |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613074154/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2822/is_3_28/ai_n15648564/pg_5 |archivedate=13 June 2013 |df= }}</ref> Of note is [[Brenda Fassie]], who launched to fame with her song "[[Weekend Special]]", which was sung in English. More famous traditional musicians include [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]], while the [[Soweto String Quartet]] performs classic music with an African flavour. South Africa has produced world-famous jazz musicians, notably [[Hugh Masekela]], [[Jonas Gwangwa]], [[Abdullah Ibrahim]], [[Miriam Makeba]], [[Jonathan Butler]], [[Chris McGregor]], and [[Sathima Bea Benjamin]]. Afrikaans music covers multiple genres, such as the [[contemporary music|contemporary]] [[Steve Hofmeyr]], the [[punk rock]] band [[Fokofpolisiekar]] and the [[singer-songwriter]] [[Jeremy Loops]]. South African popular musicians that have found international success include [[Johnny Clegg]], as well as [[Seether]].

Although few [[Cinema of South Africa|South African film]] productions are known outside South Africa itself, many foreign films have been produced about South Africa. Arguably, the most high-profile film portraying South Africa in recent years was ''[[District 9]]''. Other notable exceptions are the film ''[[Tsotsi]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Foreign Language Film]] at the [[78th Academy Awards]] in 2006, as well as ''[[U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha]]'', which won the [[Golden Bear]] at the 2005 [[Berlin International Film Festival]]. In 2015, the [[Oliver Hermanus]] film [[The Endless River (film)|''The Endless River'']] became the first South African film selected for the [[Venice Film Festival]].

South African cuisine is diverse; foods from many cultures are enjoyed by all and especially marketed to tourists who wish to sample the large variety.

[[South African cuisine]] is heavily meat-based and has spawned the distinctively South African social gathering known as the ''[[braai]]'', a variation of the [[barbecue]]. South Africa has also developed into a major wine producer, with some of the best [[vineyard]]s lying in valleys around [[Stellenbosch]], [[Franschhoek]], [[Paarl]] and [[Barrydale]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewinedoctor.com/regionalguides/southafrica.shtml |title=South African Wine Guide: Stellenbosch, Constantia, Walker Bay and more |publisher=Thewinedoctor.com |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>

South Africa hosted and won the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], and won the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in [[France national rugby union team|France]]. It followed the 1995 Rugby World Cup by hosting the [[1996 African Cup of Nations]], with the national team, the [[Springboks]], going on to win the tournament. It also hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]], the [[ICC World Twenty20|2007 World Twenty20 Championship]]. South Africa's national cricket team, the [[South Africa national cricket team|Proteas]], has also won the inaugural edition of the [[1998 ICC KnockOut Trophy]] by defeating [[West Indies national cricket team|West Indies]] in the final. [[South Africa national blind cricket team|South Africa's national blind cricket team]] also went on to win the inaugural edition of the Blind Cricket World Cup in 1998.

Public universities in South Africa are divided into three types: traditional universities, which offer theoretically oriented university degrees; [[University of Technology|universities of technology]] (formerly called "[[technikon]]s"), which offer vocational oriented diplomas and degrees; and comprehensive universities, which offer both types of qualification. There are 23 public universities in South Africa: 11 traditional universities, 6 universities of technology and 6 comprehensive universities.

Under apartheid, schools for black people were subject to discrimination through inadequate funding and a separate syllabus called ''[[Bantu Education Act|Bantu Education]]'' which was only designed to give them sufficient skills to work as labourers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://overcomingapartheid.msu.edu/sidebar.php?id=3 |title=Bantu Education |publisher=Overcoming Apartheid |accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>

Following Spain's defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898, the islands were sold to [[Imperial Germany]] in 1899 under the terms of the [[German–Spanish Treaty (1899)|German–Spanish Treaty]], where they were administered as part of [[German New Guinea]], although the islands were already represented in the Malolos Congress of the revolutionary [[First Philippine Republic]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] conquered Palau during [[World War I]], and the islands were later made a part of the Japanese-ruled [[South Pacific Mandate]] by the [[League of Nations]]. During [[World War II]], skirmishes, including the major [[Battle of Peleliu]], were fought between American and Japanese troops as part of the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]]. Along with other [[Pacific Islands]], Palau was made a part of the [[United States]]-governed [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] in 1947. Having voted<!--referendum?--> against joining the Federated States of Micronesia in 1979, the islands gained full sovereignty in 1994 under a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States.

Politically, Palau is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]] in [[associated state|free association]] with the United States, which provides defense, funding, and access to social services. Legislative power is concentrated in the [[bicameral]] [[Palau National Congress]]. [[Economy of Palau|Palau's economy]] is based mainly on [[tourism]], [[subsistence agriculture]] and [[fishing]], with a significant portion of [[gross national product]] (GNP) derived from foreign aid. The country uses the [[United States dollar]] as its currency. The islands' culture mixes Micronesian, [[Melanesia]]n, Asian, and Western elements. Ethnic Palauans, the majority of the population, are of mixed Micronesian, Melanesian, and [[Austronesia]]n descent. A smaller proportion of the population is descended from [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] settlers. The country's two [[official language]]s are [[Palauan language|Palauan]] (a member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family) and [[English language|English]], with [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Sonsorolese language|Sonsorolese]], and [[Tobian language|Tobian]] recognized as [[regional language]]s.

==Etymology==
The name for the islands in the [[Palauan language]], ''Belau'', likely derives from either the Palauan word for "village", ''beluu'',<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Palau.html Culture of Palau] – Every Culture. Retrieved 25 May 2012.</ref> or from ''aibebelau'' ("indirect replies"), relating to a creation myth.<ref>[http://www.underwatercolours.com/bai/bais.html The Bais of Belau] – Underwater Colours. Retrieved 25 May 2012.</ref> The name "Palau" entered the [[English language]] from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Los Palaos'', via the [[German language|German]] ''Palau''. An archaic name for the islands in English was the "Pelew Islands".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010419154512/http://www.underwatercolors.com/neco.html Palau: Portrait of Paradise]. Underwater Colours. Retrieved 25 May 2012.</ref> ''Palau'' is unrelated to ''Pulau'', which is a [[Malay language|Malay]] word meaning "island" found in a number of place names in the region.

=== Early history ===
Palau was originally settled between the [[3rd millennium BCE|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BCE|2nd millennia BCE]], most likely from [[Indonesia]] or the [[Philippines]].<ref>[http://histclo.com/country/oce/pal/co-pal.html Palau] – Historical Boys' Clothing. Retrieved 25 May 2012.</ref>

[[Sonsorol]], part of the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]], an island chain approximately {{convert|600|km|mi|sp=us}} from the main island chain of Palau, was sighted by Europeans as early as 1522, when the Spanish mission of the ''[[Trinidad (ship)|Trinidad]]'', the flagship of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s voyage of circumnavigation, sighted two small islands around the [[5th parallel north]], naming them "San Juan".<ref>[http://www.micsem.org/pubs/articles/historical/forships/palau.htm Palau] – Foreign Ships in Micronesia. Retrieved 25 May 2012.</ref>

[[File:Islas Marianas Palaos y Carolinas.JPG|left|thumb|Map of 1888 showing the Spanish East Indies, including Palau Islands (map without Philippines)]]
After the conquest of the Philippines in 1565 by the [[Spanish Empire]], the archipelago of Palau became part of the territory of the [[Captaincy General of the Philippines]], established in 1574 as part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] with the capital based in the colonial centre in [[Manila]]. However, the Spanish presence only began to express with [[evangelization]], began at the end of the 17th century, and its dominance began to take shape in the 18th century.

=== After 16th century ===
The conscious discovery of Palau came a century later in 1697 when a group of Palauans were shipwrecked on the Philippine island of [[Samar Island|Samar]] to the northwest. They were interviewed by the [[Czechs|Czech]] missionary [[Pablo Clain|Paul Klein]] on 28 December 1696. Klein was able to draw the first map of Palau based on the Palauans' representation of their home islands that they made with an arrangement of 87 pebbles on the beach. Klein reported his findings to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Superior General in a letter sent in June 1697,<ref>{{cite book|author=Serrano, Andres |title=Los siete principes de los Angeles: validos del Rey del cielo. Misioneros, y protectores de la Tierra, con la practica de su deuocion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-6StnGKAIQC&pg=PR132|year=1707|publisher=por Francisco Foppens|pages=132–}}</ref> equaling to the discovery of Palau.

=== Spanish era ===
{{Main|New Spain|Captaincy General of the Philippines|Spanish East Indies}}
This map and the letter caused a vast interest in the new islands. Another letter written by Fr. Andrés Serrano was sent to Europe in 1705, essentially copying the information given by Klein. The letters resulted in three unsuccessful Jesuit attempts to travel to Palau from [[Spanish Philippines]] in 1700, 1708 and 1709. The islands were first visited by the Jesuit expedition led by Francisco Padilla on 30 November 1710. The expedition ended with the stranding of the two priests, Jacques Du Beron and Joseph Cortyl, on the coast of Sonsorol, because the mother ship ''Santísima Trinidad'' was driven to [[Mindanao]] by a storm. Another ship was sent from [[Guam]] in 1711 to save them only to capsize, causing the death of three more Jesuit priests. The failure of these missions gave Palau the original Spanish name ''Islas Encantadas'' (Enchanted Islands).<ref>[http://micsem.org/pubs/articles/religion/frames/cathmissionsfr.htm Francis X. Hezel, SJ, Catholic Missions in the Carolines and Marshall Islands]. Micsem.org. Retrieved on 12 September 2015.</ref> Despite these early misfortunes, the [[Spanish Empire]] later came to dominate the islands.

British traders became prominent visitors to Palau in the 18th century, followed by expanding Spanish influence in the 19th century. Palau, under the name ''Palaos'', was included in the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]], the first revolutionary congress in the [[Philippines]] which aimed to become fully independent from colonialists. Palau, at the time, was part of the Philippines. Palau had one appointed member to the Congress, becoming the only group of islands in the entire Caroline Islands to be granted high representation in a non-colonial Philippine Congress. The Congress also supported the right of Palau to self-determination if ever it wishes to pursue such a path.<ref name=PhilStar2006>{{cite news|last=Balabo|first=Dino|title=Historians: Malolos Congress produced best RP Constitution|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/374302/historians-malolos-congress-produced-best-rp-constitution|accessdate=12 August 2013|newspaper=[[Philippine Star]]|date=December 10, 2006}}</ref> During [[World War I]], the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] annexed the islands after seizing them from Germany in 1914. Following World War I, the [[League of Nations]] formally placed the islands under Japanese administration as part of the [[Nanyo (Japanese mandated territory)|South Pacific Mandate]]. In World War II, Palau was used by Japan to support its [[Philippines Campaign (1941–1942)|1941 invasion of the Philippines]], which succeeded in 1942. The invasion overthrew the American-installed Commonwealth government in the Philippines and installed the Japanese-backed [[Second Philippine Republic]] in 1943.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=t2-OmUA-EscC&pg=PA166&dq=palau+japanese+invasion+philippines#v=onepage&q=palau%20japanese%20invasion%20philippines&f=false|quote=Admiral Takeo Takagi led the Philippines support force to Palau, an island 500 miles east of the southern Philippines where he waited to join the attack.|p=166|title=Japan Goes to War: A Chronology of Japanese Military Expansion from the Meiji Era to the Attack on Pearl Harbor (1868-1941)|author= Dorothy Perkins|publisher=DIANE Publishing|date=1997|isbn=9780788134272}}</ref>

=== United States era ===
During [[World War II]], the [[United States]] captured Palau from Japan in 1944 after the costly [[Battle of Peleliu]], when more than 2,000 Americans and 10,000 Japanese were killed. In 1945–1946, the United States re-established control on the [[Philippines]], and managed Palau through the Philippine capital of [[Manila]]. By the later half of 1946, however, the Philippines was granted full independence with the formation of the [[Third Republic of the Philippines]], shifting the US Far West Pacific capital to [[Guam]]. Palau passed formally to the United States under [[United Nations]] auspices in 1947 as part of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] established pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 21|Security Council Resolution 21]].

=== Independence ===
[[File:TTPI High Commissioner and staff.jpg|thumb|TTPI High Commissioner and staff, 1960s]]
Four of the Trust Territory districts joined together and formed the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] in 1979, but the districts of Palau and the [[Marshall Islands]] declined to participate. Palau, the westernmost cluster of the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], instead opted for independent status in 1978, which was widely supported by the [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Japan]]. It approved a new constitution and became the Republic of Palau on 1 January 1981.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Pacific Island Battleground Now the Republic of Belau |agency=Associated Press |publisher=Bangor Daily News, via Google News |location=Bangor, Maine, USA |date=23 January 1981 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xHI-AAAAIBAJ&sjid=3VkMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1189,3024338&dq=micronesia&hl=en}}</ref> It signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the [[United States]] in 1982.

Legislation making Palau an "offshore" financial center was passed by the Senate in 1998. In 2001, Palau passed its first [[bank regulation]] and anti-[[money laundering]] laws. In 2005,  Palau led the [[Micronesia challenge]], which would conserve 30% of near-shore coastal waters and 20% of forest land of participating countries by 2020.

==Politics and government==
{{Main|Politics of Palau}}
[[File:Capitol, Melekeok, Palau.jpg|thumb|Capitol of Palau, the seat of government.]]

Palau is a [[Representative democracy|democratic]] [[republic]]. The [[President of Palau]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government, while [[legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Palau National Congress]]. The [[Judiciary of Palau|judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Palau adopted a constitution in 1981.

The governments of the United States and Palau concluded a [[Compact of Free Association]] in 1986, similar to compacts that the United States had entered into with the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]].<ref name="gao-08-732_p7">{{cite journal|title=Compact of Free Association: Palau's use of and accountability for U.S. assistance and prospects for economic self-sufficiency|journal=Report to Congressional Committees|date=10 June 2008|volume=GAO-08-732|pages=1–2|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/280/276299.pdf|accessdate=7 September 2014|format=PDF}}</ref> The compact entered into force on 1 October 1994, concluding Palau's transition from trusteeship to independence<ref name="gao-08-732_p7"/> as the last portion of the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] to secure its independence pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 956|Security Council Resolution 956]].

Under the compact, the [[American military]] was granted access to the islands for 50 years. The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] role is minimal, limited to a handful of Navy [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabees]] (construction engineers). The [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] patrols in national waters.

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Palau}}
As a sovereign nation, Palau conducts its own foreign relations.<ref name="gao-08-732_p7"/> Since independence, Palau has established diplomatic relations with a number of nations, including many of its Pacific neighbors, like [[Micronesia]] and the [[Philippines]]. On 29 November 1994, the [[United Nations Security Council]] passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 963|Resolution 963]] recommending Palau's admission to the [[United Nations]]. The [[United Nations General Assembly]] approved admission for Palau pursuant to Resolution 49/63 on 15 December 1994.<ref>[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/49/63 United Nations General Assembly Resolution 49/63, ''Admission of the Republic of Palau to Membership in the United Nations'', adopted 15 December 1994]. Un.org. Retrieved on 12 September 2015.</ref> Palau has since joined several other international organizations. In September 2006, Palau hosted the first Taiwan-Pacific Allies Summit. Its President has made official visits to other Pacific countries, including Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/press/release/press4e_000553.html|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|date=2014-12-15|language=en|title=The President of the Republic of Palau to Visit Japan|location=Tokyo}}</ref>

The United States maintains a diplomatic delegation and an embassy in Palau, but most aspects of the countries' relationship have to do with Compact-funded projects, which are the responsibility of the U.S. [[Department of the Interior]]'s [[Office of Insular Affairs]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071024234958/http://www.doi.gov/oia/Firstpginfo/oia_responsibilities.html Responsibilities and Authorities]. USDOI Office of Insular Affairs. doi.gov</ref>  For example, as part of this Compact, Palau was granted zip codes 96939 and 96940, along with regular US Mail delivery.

In international politics, Palau often votes with the United States on [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolutions.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/82642.pdf General Assembly – Overall Votes – Comparison with U.S. vote] lists Palau as in the country with the third high coincidence of votes. Palau has always been in the top three.</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Palau}}

Palau's territory consists of an [[archipelago]] located in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Its most populous [[island]]s are [[Angaur]], [[Babeldaob]], [[Koror]] and [[Peleliu]]. The latter three lie together within the same [[Coral reef|barrier reef]], while Angaur is an oceanic island several miles to the south. About two-thirds of the [[population]] lives on Koror.

The [[coral]] [[atoll]] of [[Kayangel]] is north of these islands, while the uninhabited [[Rock Islands (Palau)|Rock Islands]] (about 200) are west of the main island group. A remote group of six islands, known as the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]], some {{convert|375|mi|km}} from the main islands, make up the states of Hatohobei and Sonsorol.

===Climate===

Palau has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] with an annual [[arithmetic mean|mean]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|28|C|abbr=on}}. [[Rainfall]] is heavy throughout the [[year]], averaging {{convert|3800|mm|abbr=on}}. The average [[humidity]] is 82% and, although rain falls more frequently between July and October, there is still much [[sunlight|sunshine]].

[[Tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are rare, as Palau lies outside the main typhoon zone. The strongest typhoon that struck Palau since reliable records was [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in [[2013 Pacific typhoon season|2013]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kitamoto|first1=Asanobu|title=Histogram of Typhoons Within 1 Degree of Koror|url=http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/cgi-bin/dt/view_hist.pl?lang=en&cmd=nn_pressure&basin=wnp&gid=40c8f127cdf990173254578948ac8291&lat=7.36&min=870&lon=134.48&quant=10|publisher=Digital Typhoon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> A mandatory [[emergency evacuation]] was issued for [[Kayangel]]. A [[storm surge]] damaged several houses. Despite residents' refusal to evacuate safely, no fatalities or major injuries were reported.

===Environment===

[[File:Palau 2008030818 4709 (2347767520).jpg|thumb|An aerial view of limestone islands.]]

While much of Palau remains free of environmental degradation, areas of concern include illegal [[blast fishing|dynamite fishing]], inadequate [[waste management|solid waste disposal]] facilities in [[Koror]] and extensive [[sand]] and [[coral]] [[dredging]] in the Palau [[lagoon]]. As with other Pacific island nations, [[sea-level rise|rising sea level]] presents a major environmental threat. Inundation of low-lying areas threatens coastal [[vegetation]], [[agriculture]], and an already insufficient [[water supply]]. [[Wastewater treatment]] is a problem, along with the handling of [[toxic waste]] from [[fertilizer]]s and [[biocide]]s.

[[Saltwater crocodile]]s are also indigenous to Palau and occur in varying numbers throughout the various [[mangrove]]s and in parts of the rock islands. Although this [[species]] is generally considered extremely dangerous, there has only been one fatal human attack in Palau within modern history, and that was in the 1960s. In Palau, the largest crocodile measured in at {{convert|4.5|m|ft|sp=us}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The nation is also vulnerable to [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano|volcanic activity]], and [[tropical cyclone|tropical storms]]. Palau already has a problem with inadequate [[water supply]] and limited [[agricultural land|agricultural areas]] to support its [[population]].

On 5 November 2005, President Tommy E. Remengesau, Jr. took the lead on a regional environmental initiative called the [[Micronesia challenge]], which would conserve 30% of near-shore coastal waters and 20% of [[forest|forest land]] by 2020. Following Palau, the initiative was joined by the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[territory (geographic region)|territories]] of [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]]. Together, this combined region represents nearly 5% of the marine area of the [[Pacific Ocean]] and 7% of its [[coastline]].

===Sanctuary===
On 25 September 2009, Palau announced that it would create the world's first [[shark sanctuary]].<ref name="Palau creates world's first shark haven">{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508795&publicationSubCategoryId=200|title=Palau creates world's first shark haven|date=26 September 2009|accessdate=28 September 2009|work=[[The Philippine Star]]|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130104125625/http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508795&publicationSubCategoryId=200|archive-date=4 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Palau banned all commercial [[shark]] [[fishing]] within the waters of its [[exclusive economic zone|exclusive economic zone (EEZ)]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Palau}}

Palau's [[economy]] consists primarily of [[tourism]], [[subsistence agriculture]] and [[fishing]]. Tourist activity focuses on [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]] in the islands' rich marine environment, including its [[Coral reef|barrier reefs]]' walls and [[World War II]] [[shipwreck|wrecks]]. The government is the largest [[employment|employer]], relying heavily on [[United States|U.S.]] [[aid|financial assistance]]. Business and tourist arrivals numbered some 50,000 in [[fiscal year]] 2000–2001.

[[File:Japan Palau Friendship Bridge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Koror–Babeldaob Bridge]]]]
The [[population]] enjoys a [[per capita income]] twice that of [[Micronesia]] as a whole. Long-term prospects for the key tourist sector have been greatly bolstered by the expansion of [[air travel]] in the [[Pacific Rim|Pacific]], the rising prosperity of leading [[East Asia]]n [[country|countries]] and the willingness of [[alien (law)|foreigners]] to [[investment|finance]] [[infrastructure]] development.

[[Airline|Air service]] has at times been spotty. [[Palau Micronesia Air]], [[Asian Spirit]] and [[Pacific Flier]] provided service to the [[Philippines]] and other destinations at various times during the 2000s, but all suspended service.<ref>{{cite web|title=Palau's PacificFlier relooks business plan after suspension|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2010/08/13/346121/palaus-pacificflier-relooks-business-plan-after-suspension.html|author=Ghim-Lay Yeo|publisher=Flightglobal |accessdate=13 September 2011}}</ref> [[United Airlines]] now provides near-daily service to and from [[Guam]], and once-weekly service to [[Yap]]. Also, [[Korean Air]] provides service three times per week to [[Incheon]].

In November 2006, [[Palau Saving Bank]] officially announced [[bankruptcy]]. On 13 December 2006, the [[Palau Horizon]] reported that 641 [[deposit account|depositors]] had been affected. Among them, 398 held less than US$5,000, with the remainder ranging from US$5,000 to US$2 million. On 12 December 79 affected people received compensation. Mr. Toribiong said, "The fund for the payout came from the balance of Palau government's loan from [[Taiwan]]." From a total of US$1 million, which originally was for assisting Palau's development, US$955,000 was left at the time of bankruptcy. Toribiong requested the Taiwanese government use the balance to repay its loans. Taiwan agreed to the request. The compensation would include those who held less than US$4,000 in an account.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tw.news.yahoo.com/article/url/d/a/101220/2/2jatl.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224064906/http://tw.news.yahoo.com/article/url/d/a/101220/2/2jatl.html |archivedate=24 December 2010 |publisher=udn.com Center| accessdate=20 December 2010|title=帛琉銀行倒閉 賠償存戶竟由台灣埋單 (Taiwan pay for the bill of compensation for PSB bankruptcy)|author=李光儀、王光慈}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Palau International Airport 1.JPG|thumb|[[Palau International Airport]]]]
[[Palau International Airport]] provides scheduled [[direct flight]]s with [[Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport|Guam]], [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila]], [[Incheon International Airport|Seoul]] and [[Taoyuan International Airport|Taipei]] and since December 2010, [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo-Narita]]. [[Palau Pacific Airways]] also has charter flights to and from [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]] and [[Macau International Airport|Macau]]. In addition, the states of [[Angaur]] and [[Peleliu]] have regular service to domestic destinations.

Freight, military and cruise ships often call at Malakal Harbor, on [[Malakal Island]] outside Koror. The country has no [[railway]]s, and of the {{convert|61|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} of [[highway]]s, only {{convert|36|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} are [[Road surface|paved]]. [[Driving]] is on the right and the [[speed limit]] is {{convert|40|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. [[Taxicab|Taxis]] are available in Koror. They are not metered and [[fare]]s are negotiable. Transportation between islands mostly relies on private [[boat]]s and domestic [[airline|air services]]. However, there are some state run boats<ref>{{cite web|url=http://outofyourcomfortzone.net/all-the-schedules-and-prices-for-palaus-state-boat-between-koror-peleliu-and-angaur/|title=All the Schedules and Prices for Palau’s State Ferries between Koror, Peliliu and Angour|date=17 February 2016|publisher=}}</ref> between islands as a cheaper alternative.

The population of Palau is approximately {{UN_Population|Palau}}, of whom 73% are native Palauans of mixed [[Melanesia]]n, and [[Austronesian]] descent. There are many Asian communities within Palau. [[Filipinos in Palau|Filipinos]] form the largest Asian group and second largest ethnic group in the country. There are significant numbers of [[Chinese in Palau|Chinese]] and [[Koreans in Micronesia|Koreans]]. There are also smaller numbers of Palauans of mixed or full [[Japanese settlement in Palau|Japanese ancestry]]. Smaller numbers of [[Bangladeshi diaspora|Bangladeshi]] and [[Non Resident Nepali|Nepalese]] migrant workers and their descendants who came to the islands during the late 1900s can also be found. Most Palauans of Asian origin came during the late 1900s with many Filipinos, Chinese, Bangladeshis and Nepalese coming to Palau as unskilled workers and professionals.<ref>{{cite book|author=R. G.

===Languages===
The official languages of Palau are [[Palauan language|Palauan]] and [[English language|English]], except for two states ([[Sonsorol]] and [[Hatohobei]]) where the local language, [[Sonsorolese language|Sonsorolese]] and [[Tobian language|Tobian]], respectively, along with Palauan, is official.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Palau}}

According to 2015 estimates 45.3% of the population is [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] (due to its shared colonial heritage with the [[Philippines]]), 6.9% [[Seventh-day Adventism|Seventh-day Adventist]], 34.9% other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] (due to American colonial rule), 5.7% [[Modekngei]] and 3.0% [[Islam|Muslim]] (due to its shared Islamic heritage with southern [[Philippines]]).<ref name="cia"/> In 2009, the small [[Jewish]] community sent two cyclists to the 18th [[Maccabiah Games]].<ref>{{cite news|title=I've Got Friends in Low-lying Places... |url= http://www.jewishideasdaily.com/5515/features/ive-got-friends-in-low-lying-places-2/?print |last=Sokolow|first=Moshe|date=6 December 2012|work=[[Jewish Ideas Daily]]|accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>

The German and Japanese occupations of Palau both subsidized missionaries to follow the Spanish. Germans sent Roman Catholic and Protestant, Japanese sent Shinto and Buddhist, and Spaniards sent Roman Catholic missionaries as they controlled Palau. Three quarters of the population are [[Christians]] (mainly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]]), while [[Modekngei]] (a combination of Christianity, traditional Palauan religion and fortune telling) and the ancient Palauan religion are commonly observed. Japanese rule brought [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] to Palau, which were the majority religions among Japanese settlers. However, following Japan's World War II defeat, the remaining Japanese largely converted to Christianity, while the remainder continued to observe Buddhism, but stopped practicing Shinto rites.<ref>Brigham Young University—Hawaii Campus (1981), p. 36</ref> There are also approximately 400 Bengali Muslims in Palau, and recently a few [[Uyghurs]] detained in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] were allowed to settle in the island nation.

[[File:A traditional Palauan hut, 2012.jpg|thumb|A traditional Palauan house]]
Palauan society follows a very strict [[matrilineal]] system. Matrilineal practices are seen in nearly every aspect of Palauan traditions, especially in funeral, marriage, inheritance and the passing of traditional titles. The system probably had its origins from the Philippine archipelago, which had a similar system until the archipelago was colonized by Spain.

The cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]]. [[Western cuisine]] is favored among young Palauans and the locals are joined by foreign tourists. The rest of Micronesia is similar with much less tourism, leading to fewer restaurants. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Tourists eat mainly at their hotels on such islands. Some local foods include an alcoholic drink made from coconut on the tree; the drink made from the roots of the [[kava]]; and the chewing of [[betel nut]]s.

The traditional government system still influences the nation's affairs, leading the federal government to repeatedly attempt to limit its power. Many of these attempts took the form of amendments to the constitution that were supported by the corporate sector to protect what they deemed should be free economic zones. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} One such example occurred in early 2010, where the Idid clan, the ruling clan of the Southern Federation, under the leadership of Bilung, the Southern Federation's queen, raised a civil suit against the Koror State Public Lands Authority (KSPLA). The Idid clan laid claim over Malakal Island, a major economic zone and Palau's most important port, citing documents from the German Era. The verdict held that the Island belonged to the KSPLA.

===Traditional government===
The present-day "traditional" government of Palau is a continuation of its ancestor, composed of practices that span thousands of years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Traditionally, Palau was hierarchically organized. The lowest level is the village or hamlet, then the chiefdom (now politically referred to as a state) and finally alliances of chiefdoms. In ancient times, numerous federations divided power, but upon the 17th century introduction of firearms by the British, an imbalance of power occurred.

Palau became divided into northern and southern federations. The Northern Federation is headed by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling clan Uudes of Melekeok state, the Reklai and Ebilreklai. They are commonly referred to as the king and queen of the Northern Federation. This northern federation comprises the states of Kayangel, Ngerchelong, Ngardmau, Ngiwal, Ngaraard, Ngatpang, Ngeremlengui, Melekok, Aimeliik, Ngchesar and Airai. The Southern Federation is likewise represented by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling Idid of Koror state.

The Southern Federation comprises the states of Koror, Peleliu and Angaur. However, fewer and fewer Palauans have knowledge of the concept of federations, and the term is slowly dying out. Federations were established as a way of safeguarding states and hamlets who shared economic, social, and political interests, but with the advent a federal government, safeguards are less meaningful. However, in international relations, the king of Palau is synonymous with the Ibedul of Koror. This is because Koror is the industrial capital of the nation, elevating his position over the Reklai of Melekeok.

It is a misconception that the king and queen of Palau, or any chief and his female counterpart for that matter, are married. Traditional leaders and their female counterparts have always been related and unmarried (marrying relatives was a traditional taboo). Usually, a chief and his female counterpart are brother and sister, or close cousins, and have their own spouses.

===Sports===
{{See also|Baseball in Palau}}

[[Baseball]] is a popular sport in Palau after its introduction by the Japanese in the 1920s. The [[Palau national baseball team]] won the gold medal at the [[1990 Micronesian Games|1990]], [[1998 Micronesian Games|1998]] and [[2010 Micronesian Games]], as well as at the [[2007 Pacific Games]].

Palau also has a [[Palau national football team|national football team]], organized by the [[Palau Soccer Association]], but is not a member of [[FIFA]]. The Association also organizes the [[Palau Soccer League]].

===Education===

Primary education is required until age of 16. Schools include both public and private institutions as well as some fields of study available at [[Palau Community College]]. For further undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, students travel abroad to attend tertiary institutions. Popular choices among Palauan scholars include the [[San Diego State University]], [[University of the Philippines]], [[Mindanao State University]], and the [[University of the South Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/countries/Palau/Education-System|title=Palau Education System|website=www.classbase.com|access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref>

===Cuisine===

Palau has its own cuisine, for instance, a dessert called ''tama''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ayearcookingtheworld.com/tag/tama/|title=Tama – A Year Cooking the World|website=ayearcookingtheworld.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>
Palauan cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]]. It is also influenced by neighboring Philippines' [[Filipino cuisine|cuisine]], notably on its [[Asian cuisine|Asian]]-[[Latin American cuisine|Latin]] dishes. [[Megabat|Fruit bat]] soup is a commonly referenced Palauan delicacy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theherald.com.au/story/3960841/fruit-bat-soup-has-chicken-like-taste/|title=Fruit bat soup has chicken-like taste|date=2016-06-12|work=Newcastle Herald|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en}}</ref>

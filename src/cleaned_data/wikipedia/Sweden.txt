'''Sweden''' ({{lang-sv|Sverige}} {{IPA-sv|ˈsværjɛ||Sv-Sverige.ogg}}), officially the '''Kingdom of Sweden''' (Swedish: {{Audio|Sv-Konungariket Sverige.ogg|''Konungariket Sverige''}}), is a [[Scandinavia]]n [[Nordic country]] in [[Northern Europe]]. It borders [[Norway]] to the west and north and [[Finland]] to the east, and is connected to [[Denmark]] in the southwest by [[Øresund Bridge|a bridge-tunnel]] across the [[Øresund|Öresund]], a strait at the Swedish-Danish border. At {{convert|450295|km2|sqmi}}, Sweden is the largest country in [[Northern Europe]], the third-largest country in the [[European Union]] and the [[List of European countries by area|fifth largest]] country in [[Europe]] by area. Sweden has a total population of 10.2&nbsp;million<ref name="population" /> of which 2.4 million has a foreign background.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/en/ssd/START__BE__BE0101__BE0101Q/UtlSvBakgGrov/?rxid=86abd797-7854-4564-9150-c9b06ae3ab07c9b06ae3ab07|title=Number of persons by foreign/Swedish background and year|date=|website=www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se|accessdate=8 June 2018|quote=2016 Foreign background 2 320 302}}</ref> It has a low population density of {{convert|22|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}. The highest concentration is in the southern half of the country.

[[Germanic peoples]] have inhabited Sweden since [[prehistoric times]], emerging into history as the [[Geats]] (Swedish Götar) and [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]] (Svear) and constituting the sea peoples known as the [[Norsemen]]. [[South Sweden|Southern Sweden]] is predominantly [[agriculture|agricultural]], while [[Norrland terrain|the north]] is heavily forested. Sweden is part of the geographical area of [[Fennoscandia]]. The [[Sweden#Climate|climate]] is in general very mild for its northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence, that in spite of this still retains warm continental summers. Today,  the [[sovereign state]] of Sweden is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[democracy]], with a [[Monarchy of Sweden|monarch]] as [[head of state]], like its neighbour [[Norway]]. The [[capital city]] is [[Stockholm]], which is also the most populous city in the country.<!-- see [[Stockholm#Historical population]] for ambiguity about Stockholm's population --> [[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in the 349-member [[unicameral]] ''[[Riksdag]]''. [[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the [[Government of Sweden|government]] chaired by the [[Prime Minister of Sweden|prime minister]]. Sweden is a [[unitary state]], currently divided into [[counties of Sweden|21 counties]] and [[Municipalities of Sweden|290 municipalities]].

An independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. After the [[Black Death]] in the middle of the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historiska.se/upptack-historien/artikel/digerdoden/|title=Digerdöden – Historiska Museet|website=historiska.se}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://fof.se/tidning/2013/1/artikel/varre-forskarna-anat-digerdoden|title=Värre än forskarna anat: Digerdöden|publisher=|date=2012-12-15}}</ref> the [[Hanseatic League]] threatened Scandinavia's culture, finances and languages.{{dubious|date=March 2018}} This led to the forming of the Scandinavian [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.so-rummet.se/fakta-artiklar/sverige-under-medeltiden-:del-3-av-3-kalmarunionens-tid.|title=Artikelarkiv|website=SO-rummet}}</ref> which Sweden left in 1523. When Sweden became involved in the [[Thirty Years War]] on the Reformist side, an expansion of its territories began and eventually the [[Swedish Empire]] was formed. This became one of the [[great power]]s of Europe until the early 18th century. Swedish territories outside the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]] were gradually lost during the 18th and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1809. The last war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814, when Norway was militarily forced into [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]]. Since then, Sweden has been at peace, maintaining an official policy of [[Swedish neutrality|neutrality]] in foreign affairs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/dec/2/among-the-disclosures-in-the-19-documents-released/ |title=WikiLeaks reveal Swedes gave intel on Russia, Iran |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |first=Ben |last=Birnbaum |date=2 December 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref> The union with Norway was [[Dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden|peacefully dissolved]] in 1905.

After the end of the [[Cold War]], Sweden joined the European Union (EU) on 1 January 1995, but declined [[NATO]] membership, as well as [[Eurozone]] (EZ) membership following a [[Swedish euro referendum, 2003|referendum]]. It is also a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Council of Europe]], the [[World Trade Organization]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Sweden maintains a [[Nordic model|Nordic social welfare system]] that provides [[universal health care]] and [[tertiary education]] for its citizens. It has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|world's eleventh-highest per capita income]] and ranks highly in numerous metrics of national performance, including [[quality of life]], health, [[Education Index|education]], protection of [[Freedom in the World|civil liberties]], economic competitiveness, [[Gini coefficient|equality]], [[Legatum Prosperity Index|prosperity]] and [[Human Development Index|human development]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2013_EN_complete.pdf |title=2013 Human Development Report |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme]] |accessdate=28 July 2013}}</ref><ref name="OECD Better Life Index">{{cite web|title=OECD Better Life Index|url=http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/#/11111111111|publisher=[[OECD Publishing]]|accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref><ref name="wefcomp" />

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Sweden}}

The name Sweden was loaned from Dutch in the 17th century to refer to Sweden as an emerging [[Swedish Empire|great power]]. Before Sweden's imperial expansion, [[Early Modern English]] used ''Swedeland''. Sweden is derived through [[back-formation]] from Old English ''Swēoþēod'', which meant "people of the Swedes" ([[Old Norse]] ''Svíþjóð'', [[Latin]] ''Suetidi''). This word is derived from ''Sweon/Sweonas'' (Old Norse ''Sviar'', Latin ''Suiones''). The Swedish name ''Sverige'' (a compound of the words ''Svea'' and ''rike'', with [[lenition]] of the consonant [k], first recorded in the cognate ''Swēorice'' in [[Beowulf]])<ref>{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |trans-title=Swedish etymological dictionary |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerup |location=Lund |language=Swedish |page=917 |url=http://runeberg.org/svetym/1005.html}}</ref> literally means "realm of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]]", excluding the [[Geats]] in [[Götaland]].

Variations of the name ''Sweden'' are used in most languages, with the exception of [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] using ''Sverige'', [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''Svøríki'', [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''Svíþjóð'', and the more notable exception of some [[Finnic languages]] where ''Ruotsi'' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and ''Rootsi'' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]]) are used, names commonly considered as referring to the people from the coastal areas of [[Roslagen]], [[Uppland]], who were known as the ''[[Rus' people|Rus']]'', and through them etymologically related to the English name for [[Russia]].

The etymology of ''Swedes'', and thus ''Sweden'', is generally not agreed upon but may derive from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''Swihoniz'' meaning "one's own",<ref>{{cite book |last=Hellquist |first=Elof |title=Svensk etymologisk ordbok |trans-title=Swedish etymological dictionary |year=1922 |publisher=Gleerup |location=Lund |language=Swedish |page=915}}</ref> referring to one's own Germanic tribe.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2015}}
{{Main|History of Sweden}}

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistoric Sweden}}
[[File:Vendel I helmet 456057.jpg|thumb|A [[Vendel era|Vendel-era]] helmet, at the Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]]
Sweden's prehistory begins in the [[Allerød oscillation]],{{according to whom|date=May 2015}} a warm period around 12,000 BC, with Late [[Palaeolithic]] [[reindeer]]-hunting camps of the [[Bromme culture]] at the edge of the ice in what is now the country's southernmost province, [[Scania]]. This period was characterised by small bands of [[Hunter-gatherer|hunter-gatherer-fishers]] using [[flint]] technology.

Sweden is first described in a written source in ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'' by [[Tacitus]] in 98 AD. In [[s:Germania#XLIV|Germania 44 and 45]] he mentions the Swedes (''Suiones'') as a powerful tribe (''distinguished not merely for their arms and men, but for their powerful fleets'') with ships that had a [[prow]] at each end ([[longship]]s). Which kings (''kuningaz'') ruled these Suiones is unknown, but [[Norse mythology]] presents a long line of legendary and semi-legendary kings going back to the last centuries BC. As for literacy in Sweden itself, the [[runic alphabet|runic script]] was in use among the south Scandinavian elite by at least the 2nd century AD, but all that has come down to the present from the Roman Period is curt inscriptions on artefacts, mainly of male names, demonstrating that the people of south Scandinavia spoke [[Proto-Norse]] at the time, a language ancestral to Swedish and other [[North Germanic languages]].{{Primary source inline|date=May 2015}}

In the 6th century [[Jordanes]] names two tribes living in [[Scandza]], both of which are now considered to be synonymous with the Swedes: the ''Suetidi'' and ''Suehans''. ''Suetidi'' is considered to be the Latin form of ''Svíþjóð'', the Old Norse name for the Swedes. Jordanes describes the ''Suetidi'' and ''[[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Dani]]'' as being of the same stock and the tallest of people. He later mentions other Scandinavian tribes as being of a same stature.{{Primary source inline|date=May 2015}} The ''Suehans'' were known to the Roman world as suppliers of black fox skins and, according to Jordanes, had very fine horses, similar to those of the ''[[Thuringians|Thyringi]]'' of ''Germania'' (''alia vero gens ibi moratur Suehans, quae velud Thyringi equis utuntur eximiis''). The Icelandic historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] also wrote that the Swedish king [[Adils]] (Eadgils) had the finest horses of his day.

===The Vikings===
{{See also|Early Swedish history|Foundation of Modern Sweden|Varangians}}
[[File:Vikings-Voyages.png|thumb|left|Swedish [[Viking]] expeditions (marked in blue)]]

The Swedish [[Viking Age]] lasted roughly from the 8th century to the 11th century. It is believed that Swedish Vikings and [[Gutar]] mainly travelled east and south, going to Finland, the [[Baltic countries]], Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, the [[Black Sea]] and even as far as [[Baghdad]]. Their routes passed [[The Trade Route from the Varangians to the Greeks|through the Dnieper]] south to [[Constantinople]], on which they carried out numerous raids. The [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] noticed their great skills in war, and invited them to serve as his personal bodyguard, known as the [[Varangian Guard]]. The Swedish Vikings, called [[Rus (people)|Rus]] are believed to be the founding fathers of [[Kievan Rus']]. The Arab traveller [[Ibn Fadlan]] described these Vikings as follows:

{{quote|I have seen the Rus as they came on their merchant journeys and encamped by the [[Volga|Itil]]. I have never seen more perfect physical specimens, tall as date palms, blond and ruddy; they wear neither tunics nor caftans, but the men wear a garment which covers one side of the body and leaves a hand free. Each man has an axe, a sword, and a knife, and keeps each by him at all times. The swords are broad and grooved, of Frankish sort.<ref>Quoted from: Gwyn Jones. ''A History of the Vikings''. Oxford University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-19-280134-1}}. Page 164.</ref>}}
[[File:Bildsten med skepp 800-1099 Tjängvide, Gotland.jpg|thumb|The [[Tjängvide image stone]] dating from 800-1099, example of Viking art]]
The actions of these [[Vikings|Swedish Vikings]] are commemorated on many [[runestone]]s in Sweden, such as the [[Greece runestones]] and the [[Varangian runestones]]. There was also considerable participation in expeditions westwards, which are commemorated on stones such as the [[England runestones]]. The last major Swedish Viking expedition appears to have been the ill-fated expedition of [[Ingvar the Far-Travelled]] to [[Serkland]], the region south-east of the [[Caspian Sea]]. Its members are commemorated on the [[Ingvar runestones]], none of which mentions any survivor. What happened to the crew is unknown, but it is believed that they died of sickness.

=== The Kingdom of Sweden ===

It is not known when and how the kingdom of Sweden was born, but the [[list of Swedish monarchs]] is drawn from the first kings known to have ruled both [[Svealand]] (Sweden) and Götaland (Gothia) as one province, beginning with [[Eric the Victorious]]. Sweden and Gothia were two separate nations long before that and since antiquity. It is not known how long they existed: the epic poem ''Beowulf'' describes semi-legendary [[Swedish-Geatish wars]] in the 6th century. ''Götaland'' in this sense mainly includes the provinces of [[Östergötland]] (East Gothia) and [[Västergötland]] (West Gothia). The island of [[Gotland]] was disputed by other than Swedes, at this time (Danish, Hanseatic, and Gotland-domestic). [[Småland]] was at that time of little interest to anyone due to the deep pine forests, and only the city of [[Kalmar]] with its castle was of importance. The south-west parts of the Scandinavian peninsula consisted of three Danish provinces ([[Scania]], [[Blekinge]] and [[Halland]]). North of Halland, Denmark had a direct border to Norway and its province [[Bohuslän]]. But there were Swedish settlements along the southern coastline of [[Norrland]].

[[File:Suecia 1-064 ; Gambla Ubsala högar.png|thumb|left|[[Gamla Uppsala]] (Old Uppsala), a site of religious and political importance in the early days of Sweden]]

During the early stages of the Scandinavian Viking Age, [[Ystad]] in the [[Denmark|Danish]] province Scania and [[Paviken]] on Gotland were flourishing centres of trade, but they were not parts of the early Swedish Kingdom. Remains of what is believed to have been a large market dating from 600 to 700 AD have been found in Ystad.<ref name="Sawyer" /> In Paviken, an important centre of trade in the Baltic region during the 9th and 10th century, remains have been found of a large Viking Age harbour with shipbuilding yards and handicraft industries. Between 800 and 1000, trade brought an abundance of silver to Gotland, and according to some scholars, the Gotlanders of this era hoarded more silver than the rest of the population of Scandinavia combined.<ref name="Sawyer">{{cite book |last1=Sawyer |first1=Birgit |first2=Peter |last2=Sawyer |year=1993 |title=Medieval Scandinavia: from Conversion to Reformation, Circa 800–1500 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-1739-5 |pages=150–153}}</ref>

[[Ansgar|St Ansgar]] is usually credited with introducing Christianity in 829, but the new religion did not begin to fully replace [[paganism]] until the 12th century. During the 11th century, Christianity became the prevalent religion, and from 1050 Sweden is counted as a Christian nation. The period between 1100 and 1400 was characterised by internal power struggles and competition among the Nordic kingdoms. In the years 1150–1293 according to the legend of [[Eric IX of Sweden|Eric IX]] and the ''[[Eric Chronicles]]'' Swedish kings made a [[First Swedish Crusade|first]], [[Second Swedish Crusade|second]] and [[Third Swedish Crusade|third crusade]] to pagan Finland against [[Finns proper|Finns]], [[Tavastians]] and [[Karelians]] and started conflicts with the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] who no longer had any connection with Sweden.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bagge |first=Sverre |chapter=The Scandinavian Kingdoms |title=The New Cambridge Medieval History |editor-first=Rosamond |editor-last=McKitterick |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-521-36289-4 |page=724 |quote=Swedish expansion in Finland led to conflicts with Rus', which were temporarily brought to an end by a peace treaty in 1323, dividing the Karelian peninsula and the northern areas between the two countries.}}</ref> The [[Swedish colonisation of Finland|Swedish colonisation]] of the coastal areas of Finland started also during the 12th and 13th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=När kom svenskarna till Finland?|editor-first=Ann-Marie|editor-last=Ivars|editor-first2=Lena|editor-last2= Hulden|publisher=Studier utg. av Svenska Litteratursällskapet i Finland 646|year=2002|isbn=|location=Helsinki|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Om svenskarnes inflyttningar till Finland|last=Meinander|first=Carl Fredrik|publisher=Historisk Tidskrift för Finland 3/1983|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref> In the 14th century, the Swedish colonisation of coastal areas of Finland began to be more organised and in the end of the century several of the coastal areas of Finland were inhabited mostly by Swedes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sveriges Österland: Från forntiden till Gustav Vasa.

Former slaves tended to be absorbed into the peasantry, and some became labourers in the towns. Still, Sweden remained a poor and economically backward country in which barter was the primary means of exchange. For instance, the farmers of the province of [[Dalsland]] would transport their butter to the mining districts of Sweden and exchange it there for iron, which they would then take to the coast and trade for fish, which they consumed, while the iron would be shipped abroad.<ref>Scott, pp. 55–56.</ref>

[[File:Skogbonaden.jpg|thumb|[[Skog tapestry]], made most probably during the late 13th century.]]

In the middle of the 14th century, Sweden was struck by the [[Black Death]].<ref>Scott, pp. 56–57.</ref> The population of Sweden and most of Europe was seriously decimated. The population (at same territory) did not reach the numbers of the year 1348 again until the beginning of the 19th century. One third of the population died in the triennium of 1349–1351. During this period, the Swedish cities began to acquire greater rights and were strongly influenced by German merchants of the [[Hanseatic League]], active especially at [[Visby]]. In 1319, Sweden and Norway were united under King Magnus Eriksson, and in 1397 Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark]] effected the personal union of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark through the [[Kalmar Union]]. However, Margaret's successors, whose rule was also centred in Denmark, were unable to control the Swedish nobility.

Many times the Swedish crown was inherited by children kings over the course of the kingdom's existence; consequently real power was held for long periods by regents (notably those of the [[Sture]] family) chosen by the Swedish parliament. King [[Christian II of Denmark]], who asserted his claim to Sweden by force of arms, ordered a massacre of Swedish nobles in Stockholm in 1520. This came to be known as the "[[Stockholm blood bath]]" and stirred the Swedish nobility to new resistance and, on 6 June (now Sweden's national holiday) in 1523, they made [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] their king.<ref>Scott, p. 121.</ref> This is sometimes considered as the [[foundation of modern Sweden]]. Shortly afterwards the new king rejected Catholicism and led Sweden into the [[Protestant Reformation]].

The Hanseatic League had been officially formed at [[Lübeck]] on the Baltic coast of [[Holy Roman Empire|Northern Germany]] in 1356. The League sought civil and commercial privileges from the princes and royalty of the countries and cities along the coasts of the Baltic Sea.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert S. |last1=Hoyt |first2=Stanley |last2=Chodorow |title=Europe in the Middle Ages |publisher=Harcourt, Brace & Jovanovich, Inc. |location=New York |year=1976 |page=628}}</ref> In exchange, they offered a certain amount of protection to the joining cities. Having their own navy, the Hansa were able to sweep the Baltic Sea free of pirates.<ref>{{cite book |first=John B. |last=Wolfe |title=The Emergence of European Civilization |publisher=Harper & Row Pub. |location=New York |year=1962 |pages=50–51}}</ref> The privileges obtained by the Hansa included assurances that only Hansa citizens would be allowed to trade from the ports where they were located. They sought agreement to be free of all customs and taxes. With these concessions, Lübeck merchants flocked to Stockholm, where they soon came to dominate the city's economic life and made the port city of Stockholm into the leading commercial and industrial city of Sweden.<ref name="Scott, p. 52">Scott, p. 52.</ref> Under the Hanseatic trade, two-thirds of Stockholm's imports consisted of [[textiles]], while the remaining third was [[salt]]. The main exports from Sweden were [[iron]] and [[copper]].<ref name="Scott, p. 52"/>

However, the Swedes began to resent the monopoly trading position of the Hansa (mostly consisting of German citizens), and to resent the income they felt they lost to the Hansa. Consequently, when Gustav Vasa or [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav I]] broke the monopoly power of the Hanseatic League he was regarded as a hero by the Swedish people.<ref>Scott, p. 132.</ref> History now views Gustav I as the father of the modern Swedish nation. The foundations laid by Gustav would take time to develop. Furthermore, when Sweden did develop, freed itself from the Hanseatic League, and entered its golden era, the fact that the peasantry had traditionally been free meant that more of the economic benefits flowed back to them rather than going to a feudal landowning class.<ref>Scott, pp. 156–157.</ref>

===Swedish Empire===

{{See also|History of Sweden (1611–48)|Swedish Empire|Swedish overseas colonies|Age of Liberty|Gustavian era|Sweden–Finland|Union between Sweden and Norway}}

During the 17th century Sweden emerged as a European [[great power]]. Before the emergence of the Swedish Empire, Sweden was a poor and scarcely populated country on the fringe of European civilisation, with no significant power or reputation. Sweden rose to prominence on a continental scale during the tenure of king [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]], seizing territories from Russia and [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland–Lithuania]] in multiple conflicts, including the [[Thirty Years' War]].

During the Thirty Years' War, Sweden conquered approximately half of the Holy Roman states. Gustav Adolphus planned to become the new [[Holy Roman Emperor]], ruling over a united Scandinavia and the Holy Roman states, but he died at the [[Battle of Lützen (1632)|Battle of Lützen]] in 1632. After the [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]], Sweden's only significant military defeat of the war, pro-Swedish sentiment among the German states faded. These German provinces excluded themselves from Swedish power one by one, leaving Sweden with only a few northern German territories: [[Swedish Pomerania]], [[Bremen-Verden]] and [[Wismar]].

[[File:Swedish Empire (1560-1815) en2.png|thumb|The [[Swedish Empire]] between 1611 and 1815, absolute peak 1658–60]]

In the middle of the 17th century Sweden was the third-largest country in Europe by land area, only surpassed by Russia and Spain. Sweden reached its largest territorial extent under the rule of [[Charles X of Sweden|Charles X]] after the [[treaty of Roskilde]] in 1658.<ref name="HayesPSH">"A Political and Social History of Modern Europe V.1./Hayes..."

The Swedes conducted a series of invasions into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, known as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]. After more than half a century of almost constant warfare, the Swedish economy had deteriorated. It became the lifetime task of Charles' son, [[Charles XI of Sweden|Charles XI]], to rebuild the economy and refit the army. His legacy to his son, the coming ruler of Sweden, [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]], was one of the finest arsenals in the world, a large standing army and a great fleet. Sweden's largest threat at this time, Russia, had a larger army but was far behind in both equipment and training.

After the [[Battle of Narva (1700)|Battle of Narva]] in 1700, one of the first battles of the [[Great Northern War]], the Russian army was so severely devastated that Sweden had an open chance to invade Russia. However, Charles did not pursue the Russian army, instead turning against Poland–Lithuania and defeating the Polish king, [[Augustus II]], and his Saxon allies at the [[Battle of Klissow]] in 1702. This gave Russia time to rebuild and modernise its army.

[[File:Marten's Poltava.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. In the years following Poltava, Russia and her allies occupied all the [[Dominions of Sweden|Swedish dominions]] on the Baltic coast and even Finland.]]

After the success of invading Poland, Charles decided to make an attempt at invading Russia, but this ended in a decisive Russian victory at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709. After a long march exposed to [[Cossack]] raids, the Russian Tsar [[Peter the Great]]'s [[scorched-earth]] techniques and [[Great Frost of 1709|the extremely cold winter of 1709]], the Swedes stood weakened with a shattered morale and were enormously outnumbered against the Russian army at Poltava. The defeat meant the beginning of the end for the Swedish Empire. In addition, [[The plague during the Great Northern War|the plague raging in East Central Europe]] devastated the Swedish dominions and reached Central Sweden in 1710.

Charles XII attempted to invade Norway in 1716, but he was shot dead at [[Fredriksten]] fortress in 1718. The Swedes were not militarily defeated at Fredriksten, but the whole structure and organisation of the campaign fell apart with the king's death, and the army withdrew.

Forced to cede large areas of land in the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, Sweden also lost its place as an empire and as the dominant state on the Baltic Sea. With Sweden's lost influence, Russia emerged as an empire and became one of Europe's dominant nations. As the war finally ended in 1721, Sweden had lost an estimated 200,000 men, 150,000 of those from the area of present-day Sweden and 50,000 from the [[History of Finland#17th century – the Swedish Empire|Finnish]] part of Sweden.<ref>''[https://archive.today/20120530021358/http://www.algonet.se/~hogman/slsoldat.htm Losses statistics at Militaria].'' (Swedish)</ref>

In the 18th century, Sweden did not have enough resources to maintain its territories outside Scandinavia, and most of them were lost, culminating with the loss in 1809 of eastern Sweden to Russia, which became the highly autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland|Grand Principality of Finland]] in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]].

In interest of re-establishing Swedish dominance in the Baltic Sea, Sweden allied itself against its traditional ally and benefactor, France, in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Sweden's role in the [[Battle of Leipzig]] gave it the authority to force Denmark–Norway, an ally of France, to cede Norway to the King of Sweden on 14 January 1814 in exchange for northern German provinces, at the [[Treaty of Kiel]]. The Norwegian attempts to keep their status as a sovereign state were rejected by the Swedish king, [[Charles XIII]]. He launched a military campaign against Norway on 27 July 1814, ending in the [[Convention of Moss]], which forced Norway into a [[Union between Sweden and Norway|personal union]] with Sweden under the Swedish crown, which lasted until 1905. The 1814 campaign was the last time Sweden was at war.

"It is usually suggested that between 1870 and 1914 Sweden emerged from its primarily agrarian economic system into a modern industrial economy."</ref>

Strong grassroots movements sprung up in Sweden during the latter half of the 19th century (trade unions, [[temperance movement|temperance]] groups, and independent religious groups), creating a strong foundation of democratic principles. In 1889 The Swedish Social Democratic Party was founded. These movements precipitated Sweden's migration into a modern parliamentary democracy, achieved by the time of World War I. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] progressed during the 20th century, people gradually moved into cities to work in factories and became involved in socialist unions. A communist revolution was avoided in 1917, following the re-introduction of [[parliamentarism]], and the country was [[Democracy|democratised]].

===World War I and World War II===

Sweden was officially neutral during [[World War I]], although, under German pressure, they did take steps which were detrimental to the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]] including mining the [[Øresund]] channel, thus closing it to Allied shipping, and allowing the Germans to use Swedish facilities and the Swedish cipher to transmit secret messages to their overseas embassies.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Siney|first=Marion C.|title=Swedish neutrality and economic warfare in World War I|journal=Conspectus of History|year=1975|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://libx.bsu.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ConspectusH&CISOPTR=410&REC=1}}</ref> Sweden also allowed volunteers to fight for the [[White Guard (Finland)|White Guards]] alongside the Germans against the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] and Russians in the [[Finnish Civil War]], and briefly occupied the [[Åland Islands]] in co-operation with Germany.

[[File:Swedish soldier during ww2.JPG|thumb|left|A Swedish soldier during World War II. Sweden remained neutral during the conflict.]]

As in the First World War, Sweden remained officially neutral during [[World War II]], although its neutrality during World War II has been disputed.<ref name="Koblik303-313">Koblik, pp. 303–313.</ref><ref>Nordstrom, p. 315: "Sweden's government attempted to maintain at least a semblance of neutrality while it bent to the demands of the prevailing side in the struggle.

The Swedish government unofficially supported Finland in the [[Winter War]] and the [[Continuation War]] by allowing volunteers and [[materiel]] to be shipped to Finland. However, Sweden supported Norwegian resistance against Germany, and in 1943 helped [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|rescue Danish Jews]] from deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]].

During the last year of the war, Sweden began to play a role in humanitarian efforts, and many refugees, among them several thousand Jews from Nazi-occupied Europe, were rescued thanks to the [[White Buses|Swedish rescue missions to internment camps]] and partly because Sweden served as a haven for refugees, primarily from the [[Nordic countries]] and the Baltic states.<ref name="NB313-319" /><!---Nordstrom, p. 317: "In the last year of the war, Sweden became a factor in humanitarian efforts and attempts to end the war.

===Post-war era===
[[File:Olivecrona erlander 380.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister [[Tage Erlander]] (left) was Prime Minister under the ruling [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] from 1946 to 1969.]]
Sweden was officially a neutral country and remained outside [[NATO]] and [[Warsaw Pact]] membership during the [[Cold War]], but privately Sweden's leadership had strong ties with the United States and other western governments. Following the war, Sweden took advantage of an intact industrial base, social stability and its natural resources to expand its industry to supply the rebuilding of Europe.<ref name="NB335-339">Nordstrom, pp. 335–339.</ref><!---Recovery from the material damage and economic shocks of the war was more rapid than many expected."---> Sweden received aid under the [[Marshall Plan]] and participated in the OECD. During most of the post-war era, the country was governed by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] largely in co-operation with [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation|trade unions]] and industry. The government actively pursued an internationally competitive manufacturing sector of primarily large corporations.<ref name="svensteinmo" />

Sweden was one of the founding states of the [[European Free Trade Area]] (EFTA). During the 1960s the EFTA countries were often referred to as the '''Outer Seven''', as opposed to the [[Inner Six]] of the then-[[European Economic Community]] (EEC).<ref>{{cite news |title=Finland: Now, the Seven and a Half |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=7 April 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |accessdate=18 July 2009}}</ref>

Sweden, like many industrialised countries, entered a period of economic decline and upheaval following the oil embargoes of 1973–74 and 1978–79.<ref>Nordstrom, p. 344: "During the last 25 years of the century a host of problems plagued the economies of Norden and the West. Although many were present before, the 1973 and 1980 global oil crises acted as catalysts in bringing them to the fore."</ref> In the 1980s several key Swedish industries were significantly restructured.

Between 1970 and 1990 the overall tax burden rose by over 10%, and the growth was low compared to other countries in Western Europe.

The response of the government was to cut spending and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the [[welfare state]] and [[Privatization|privatising]] public services and goods. Much of the political establishment promoted EU membership, and [[Swedish European Union membership referendum, 1994|a referendum]] passed with 52.3% in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994. Sweden joined the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995. In a 2003 referendum the Swedish electorate [[Swedish euro referendum, 2003|voted against]] the country joining the [[European Monetary Union|Euro]] currency. In [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006]] Sweden got its first majority government for decades as the centre-right [[The Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance]] defeated the incumbent Social Democrat government. Following the rapid growth of support for the anti-immigration [[Sweden Democrats]], and their entrance to the Riksdag in [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010]], the Alliance became a minority cabinet.

Sweden remains non-aligned militarily, although it participates in some joint military exercises with NATO and some other countries, in addition to extensive co-operation with other European countries in the area of defence technology and defence industry. Among others, Swedish companies export weapons that were used by the American military in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=3013&date=20060207 |title=New Swedish weapon in Iraq |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=7 February 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429052619/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=3013&date=20060207 |archivedate=29 April 2013}}</ref> Sweden also has a long history of participating in international military operations, including [[Afghanistan]], where Swedish troops are under NATO command, and in EU sponsored peacekeeping operations in [[Kosovo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Cyprus]]. Sweden also participated in [[2011 military intervention in Libya|enforcing]] a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|UN mandated no-fly zone]] over Libya during the [[Arab Spring]]. Sweden held the chair of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 2009.

In recent decades Sweden has become a more culturally diverse nation due to significant immigration; in 2013 it was estimated that 15 per cent of the population was foreign-born, and an additional 5 per cent of the population were born to two immigrant parents. The influx of immigrants has brought new social challenges.

In 2014, [[Stefan Löfven]] (Social Democrats) won the General Election and became the new Swedish Prime Minister.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Sweden}}
[[File:Vy mot Stora Sjöfallet från Saltoluokta.jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Stora Sjöfallet National Park]]]]
Situated in Northern Europe, Sweden lies west of the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Gulf of Bothnia]], providing a long coastline, and forms the eastern part of the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]]. To the west is the [[Scandinavian mountain chain]] (Skanderna), a range that separates Sweden from [[Norway]]. Finland is located to its north-east. It has maritime borders with Denmark, Germany, [[Poland]], Russia, [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]], and it is also linked to Denmark (south-west) by the [[Öresund Bridge]]. Its border with Norway ([[List of countries and territories by land borders|1,619 km]] long) is the longest uninterrupted border within Europe.

Sweden lies between latitudes [[55th parallel north|55°]] and [[70th parallel north|70° N]], and mostly between longitudes [[11th meridian east|11°]] and [[25th meridian east|25° E]] (part of [[Stora Drammen]] island is just west of 11°).

At {{convert|449964|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Sweden is the 55th-largest country in the world,<ref>{{cite web|title=Country Comparison: Area|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html?countryName=Sweden&countryCode=sw&regionCode=eu&rank=55#sw|work=Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=Cia.gov|accessdate=19 August 2010}}</ref> the 4th-[[Area and population of European countries|largest country entirely in Europe]], and the largest in Northern Europe. The lowest elevation in Sweden is in the bay of Lake Hammarsjön, near [[Kristianstad]], at {{convert|-2.41|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} below sea level. The highest point is [[Kebnekaise]] at {{convert|2111|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Sweden has 25 [[Provinces of Sweden|provinces]] or ''landskap'', based on culture, geography and history. While these provinces serve no political or administrative purpose, they play an important role in people's [[self-concept|self-identity]]. The provinces are usually grouped together in three large ''[[lands of Sweden|lands]]'', parts, the northern Norrland, the central Svealand and southern Götaland. The sparsely populated Norrland encompasses almost 60% of the country. Sweden also has the [[Vindelfjällens Nature Reserve|Vindelfjällen Nature Reserve]], one of the largest protected areas in Europe, totaling 562,772 ha (approx. 5,628&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}).

About 15% of Sweden lies north of the [[Arctic Circle]]. Southern Sweden is predominantly agricultural, with increasing forest coverage northward. Around 65% of Sweden's total land area is covered with forests. The highest population density is in the [[Øresund Region|Öresund Region]] in southern Sweden, along the western coast up to central Bohuslän, and in the valley of lake [[Mälaren]] and Stockholm. Gotland and [[Öland]] are Sweden's largest [[islands of Sweden|islands]]; [[Vänern]] and [[Vättern]] are its largest lakes. Vänern is the third largest in Europe, after [[Lake Ladoga]] and [[Lake Onega]] in Russia. Combined with the third and fourth largest lakes Mälaren and [[Hjälmaren]], these lakes take up a significant part of the southern Sweden's area. Sweden's extensive waterway availability throughout the south was exploited with the building of the [[Göta Canal]] in the 19th century, shortening the potential distance between the Baltic Sea south of [[Norrköping]] and [[Gothenburg]] by using the lake and river network to facilitate the canal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gotakanal.se/en/|title=Göta kanal official website|publisher=[[Göta Canal]] |accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref>

===Climate===
Most of Sweden has a [[temperate climate]], despite its northern [[latitude]], with largely four distinct seasons and mild temperatures throughout the year. The winter in the far south is usually weak and is only manifested through some shorter periods with snow and sub-zero temperatures, autumn may well turn into spring there, without a distinct period of winter. The country can be divided into three types of climate: the southernmost part has an [[oceanic climate]], the central part has a [[humid continental climate]] and the northernmost part has a [[subarctic climate]].
However, Sweden is much warmer and drier than other places at a similar latitude, and even somewhat farther south, mainly because of the combination of the [[Gulf Stream]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/climate/impact/gulf_stream.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] |title=BBC Climate and the Gulf Stream|accessdate=29 October 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/ |title=The Gulf Stream Myth|journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=28 |issue=9|pages=393–394|accessdate=29 October 2008|bibcode=1900MWRv...28..393W |last1=Watts |first1=Harvey Maitland |year=1900|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1900)28[393:TGSM]2.0.CO;2}}</ref> and the general west wind drift, caused by the direction of planet Earth's rotation. Continental west-coasts (to which all of Scandinavia belongs, as the westernmost part of the [[Eurasia|Eurasian continent]]), are notably warmer than continental east-coasts; this can also be seen by comparing e.g. the Canadian cities of [[Vancouver]] and [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] with each other, the winter in west coast Vancouver is much milder; also, for example, central and southern Sweden has much milder winters than many parts of Russia, Canada, and the northern United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/SUSTDEV/EIdirect/climate/EIsp0002.htm |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |title=Global Climate Maps |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061117173015/http://www.fao.org/waicent/faoinfo/sustdev/EIdirect/climate/EIsp0002.htm |archivedate=17 November 2006}}</ref> Because of its high latitude, the length of daylight varies greatly. North of the Arctic Circle, the [[Midnight sun|sun never sets]] for part of each summer, and [[Polar night|it never rises]] for part of each winter. In the capital, [[Stockholm]], daylight lasts for more than 18 hours in late June but only around 6 hours in late December. Sweden receives between 1,100 and 1,900 hours of sunshine annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/klimatdata/meteorologi/stralning/1.3052 |title=Normal solskenstid för ett år |language=sv |publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |accessdate=27 January 2010}}</ref> During July there is not much difference in temperature between the north and south of the country. With the exception of in the mountains, the whole country has a July-average temperature within the range of {{convert|15|C|F|abbr=on}} to {{convert|17.5|C|F|abbr=on}} (a difference of 2.5 degrees Celsius), while the January-average temperatures vary from freezing point down to below {{convert|−15|C|F|abbr=on}} along the border with Finland (a difference of 15 degrees Celsius)<ref>as can be seen in the table below
which relies on [[SMHI]] official data for the latest fixed 30-year period, 1961 to 1990</ref>

{{wide image|Kebnekaise Panorama.jpg|800px|The [[Scandinavian Mountains]]}}
[[File:Sweden Köppen.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Köppen climate classification]] types of Sweden]]
The highest temperature ever recorded in Sweden was {{convert|38|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in [[Målilla]] in 1947, while the coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-52.6|°C|1|abbr=on}} in Vuoggatjålme in 1966. Temperatures expected in Sweden are heavily influenced by the large Fennoscandian landmass, as well as continental Europe and western Russia, which allows hot or cool inland air to be easily transported to Sweden. That in turn renders most of Sweden's southern areas having warmer summers than almost everywhere in the nearby [[British Isles]], even matching temperatures found along the continental Atlantic coast as far south as in northern [[Spain]]. In winter however the same high-pressure systems sometimes puts the entire country far below freezing temperatures. There is some maritime moderation from the Atlantic which renders the Swedish continental climate less severe than that of nearby Russia. Even though temperature patterns differ between north and south, the summer climate is surprisingly similar all through the entire country in spite of the large latitudal differences. This is due to the south being surrounded by a greater mass of water, with the wider Baltic Sea and the Atlantic air passing over lowland areas from the south-west.

Apart from the ice-free Atlantic bringing marine air into Sweden tempering winters, the mildness is further explained by prevailing low-pressure systems postponing winter, with the long nights often staying above freezing in the south of the country due to the abundant cloud cover. By the time winter finally breaks through, daylight hours rise quickly, ensuring that daytime temperatures soar quickly in spring. With the greater number of clear nights, frosts remain commonplace quite far south as late as April. The cold winters occur when low-pressure systems are weaker. An example is that the coldest ever month (January 1987) in Stockholm was also the sunniest January month on record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_jan15.pdf?71642|title=Precipitation, Sunshine & Radiation for January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv |publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/month/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_temperature_wind_jan15.pdf?18701|title=Temperature & Wind – January 2015 (all-time records section)|language=sv|publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |accessdate=31 October 2015}}</ref>

The relative strength of low and high-pressure systems of marine and continental air also define the highly variable summers. When hot continental air hits the country, the long days and short nights frequently bring temperatures up to {{convert|30|C|F}} or above even in coastal areas. Nights normally remain cool, especially in inland areas. Coastal areas can see so-called ''tropical nights'' above {{convert|20|C|F}} occur due to the moderating sea influence during warmer summers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smhi.se/kunskapsbanken/meteorologi/tropiska-natter-1.1085|title=Tropiska nätter |trans-title=Tropical nights |publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] |language=sv|accessdate=9 January 2016}}</ref> Summers can be cool, especially in the north of the country. Transitional seasons are normally quite extensive and the four-season climate applies to most of Sweden's territory, except in Scania where some years do not record a [[meteorological winter]] (see table below) or in the high Lapland mountains where polar microclimates exist.

On average, most of Sweden receives between {{convert|500|and|800|mm|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation each year, making it considerably drier than the [[Precipitation (meteorology)|global average]]. The south-western part of the country receives more precipitation, between {{convert|1000|and|1200|mm|0|abbr=on}}, and some mountain areas in the north are estimated to receive up to {{convert|2000|mm|0|abbr=on}}. Despite northerly locations, southern and central Sweden may have almost no snow in some winters. Most of Sweden is located in the [[rain shadow]] of the Scandinavian Mountains through Norway and north-west Sweden. The blocking of cool and wet air in summer as well as the greater landmass leads to warm and dry summers far north in the country, with quite warm summers at the Bothnia Bay coast at 65 degrees latitude, which is unheard of elsewhere in the world at such northerly coastlines.

=== Vegetation ===
{{Also|Wildlife of Sweden}}
[[File:Sweden Vegetation Zones.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Sweden's five major vegetation zones]]
Sweden has a considerable south to north distance (stretching between the [[latitude]]s N 55:20:13 and N 69:03:36) which causes large climatic difference, especially during the winter. The related matter of the length and strength of the four seasons plays a role in which plants that ''naturally'' can grow at various places. Sweden is divided in five major vegetation zones. These are:

* The southern deciduous forest zone
* The southern coniferous forest zone
* The northern coniferous forest zone, or the [[Taiga]]
* The alpine-birch zone
* The bare mountain zone

Please see the map to the right, Vegetation Zones in Sweden.

;Southern deciduous forest zone
Also known as the nemoral region, the southern deciduous forest zone is a part of a larger vegetation zone which also includes Denmark and large parts of Central Europe. It has to a rather large degree become agricultural areas, but larger and smaller forests still exist. The region is characterised by a large wealth of trees and shrubs. The [[beech]] are the most dominant tree, but [[oak]] can also form smaller forests. [[elm]] at one time formed forests, but have been heavily reduced due to [[Dutch Elm disease]]. Other important trees and shrubs in this zone include [[hornbeam]], [[Sambucus nigra|elder]], [[Corylus avellana|hazel]], [[Lonicera xylosteum|fly honeysuckle]], [[Tilia|linden (lime)]], [[Euonymus europaeus|spindle]], [[Taxus baccata|yew]], [[alder buckthorn]], [[blackthorn]], [[Populus tremula|aspen]], [[European rowan]], [[Swedish whitebeam]], [[Juniperus communis|juniper]], [[European holly]], [[Hedera helix|ivy]], [[Cornus sanguinea|dogwood]], [[goat willow]], [[Larix decidua|larch]], [[Prunus padus|bird cherry]], [[Prunus avium|wild cherry]], [[maple]], [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]], [[alder]] along creeks, and in sandy soil [[birch]] compete with [[pine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/naturhansyn/naturmiljoer-fran-norr-till-soder/sodra-lovskogsregionen/|title=Södra lövskogsregionen - Skogskunskap|website=www.skogskunskap.se}}</ref> [[Spruce]] is not native but between approximately 1870 and 1980 large areas were planted with it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Forest and Buildings |url=http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/skane/Sv/samhallsplanering-och-kulturmiljo/landskapsvard/kulturmiljoprogram/historia-utveckling/skogens-landskap/skog-och-bebyggelse/Pages/index.aspx |website=lansstyrelsen.se |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012055002/http://www.lansstyrelsen.se/skane/Sv/samhallsplanering-och-kulturmiljo/landskapsvard/kulturmiljoprogram/historia-utveckling/skogens-landskap/skog-och-bebyggelse/Pages/index.aspx |archivedate=2017-10-12 |language=Swedish|quote="Granskogen, som spreds norrifrån, nådde inte Skåne förrän mot slutet av 1800-talet.

;Southern coniferous forest zone
Also known as the boreo-nemoral region, the southern coniferous forest zone, is delimited by the [[oak]]'s northern natural limit (''limes norrlandicus'') and the [[Spruce]]'s southern natural limit,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skogskunskap.se/planera-skogsbruk/naturhansyn/naturmiljoer-fran-norr-till-soder/sodra-barrskogsregionen/|title=Södra barrskogsregionen - Skogskunskap|website=www.skogskunskap.se}}</ref> between the southern deciduous zone and the [[Taiga]] farther north. In the southern parts of this zone the coniferous species are found, mainly [[spruce]] and [[pine]], mixed with various deciduous trees. [[Birch]] grows largely everywhere. The [[beech]]'s northern boundary crosses this zone. This is however not the case with [[oak]] and [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash]]. Although in its natural area, also ''planted'' Spruce are common, and such woods are very dense, as the spruces can grow very tight, especially in this vegetation zone's southern areas.

;Northern coniferous forest zone, or the [[Taiga]]
The northern coniferous forest zone begins north of the natural boundary of the [[oak]]. Of deciduous species the [[birch]] is the only one of significance. [[Pine]] and [[spruce]] are dominant, but the forests are slowly but surely more sparsely grown the farther towards the north it gets. In the extreme north is it difficult to state the trees forms true forests at all, due to the large distances between the trees.

;Alpine-birch and bare mountain zones
The alpine-birch zone, in the Scandinavian mountains, depending on both latitude and altitude, is an area where only a smaller kind of [[birch]] (''Betula pubescens'' or ''B.tortuosa'') can grow. Where this vegetation zone ends no trees grow at all: the bare mountain zone.<ref>Swedish Encyclopedia "Bonniers Lexikon", vol 13 of 15, article "Sverige", Sweden, columns 1046-1050</ref>

=== Political parties and elections ===
[[File:Riksdag.ipred b9dn510 4451.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Riksdag]] chamber, at the time of a vote, in 2009]]
The Swedish Social Democratic Party has played a leading role in Swedish politics since 1917, after the [[Democratic socialism|Reformists]] had confirmed their strength and the [[Left Party (Sweden)|left-wing revolutionaries]] formed their own party. After 1932, most governments have been [[Dominant-party system#Europe|dominated]] by the Social Democrats. Only five general elections since World War II—[[Swedish general election, 1976|1976]], [[Swedish general election, 1979|1979]], [[Swedish general election, 1991|1991]], [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006]] and [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010]]—have given the assembled bloc of centre-right parties enough seats in the Riksdag to form a government.

For over 50 years, Sweden had had five parties who continually received enough votes to gain seats in the Riksdag—the Social Democrats, the [[Moderate Party]], the [[Centre Party (Sweden)|Centre Party]], the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] and the Left Party—before the [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] became the sixth party in the [[Swedish general election, 1988|1988 election]]. In the 1991 election, while the Greens lost their seats, two new parties gained seats for the first time: the [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democrats]] and [[New Democracy (Sweden)|New Democracy]]. The [[Swedish general election, 1994|1994 election]] saw the return of the Greens and the demise of New Democracy. It was not until elections in 2010 that an eighth party, the [[Sweden Democrats]], gained Riksdag seats. In the elections to the [[European Parliament]], parties who have failed to pass the Riksdag threshold have managed to gain representation at that venue: the [[June List]] ([[European Parliament election, 2004 (Sweden)|2004–2009]]), the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|Pirate Party]] ([[European Parliament election, 2009 (Sweden)|2009–2014]]), and [[Feminist Initiative (Sweden)|Feminist Initiative]] ([[European Parliament election, 2014 (Sweden)|2014–present]]).

[[File:Inför slutdebatten i SVT.jpg|thumb|left|The party leaders lined up before the start of the [[Sveriges Television|televised]] live debate on 12 September 2014.]]
In the [[Sweden general election, 2006|2006 general election]] the Moderate Party formed the centre-right [[Alliance for Sweden]] bloc and won a majority of the Riksdag seats. In the [[Sweden general election, 2010|2010 general election]] the Alliance contended against a unified left block consisting of the Social Democrats, the Greens and the Left Party.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Society/Government-politics/Reading/Center-right-wins-Swedish-election--but-short-of-majority/ |title=Center–right wins Swedish election — but short of majority |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] International/Radio Sweden |date=20 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511050348/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Society/Government-politics/Reading/Center-right-wins-Swedish-election--but-short-of-majority/ |archivedate=11 May 2012}}</ref> The Alliance won a plurality of 173 seats, but remained two seats short of a 175-seat majority.

The outcome of the [[Sweden general election, 2014|2014 general election]] resulted in the attainment of more seats by the three centre-left parties in comparison to the centre-right Alliance for Sweden, with the two blocs receiving 159 and 141 seats respectively.<ref name="2014 Election Result">{{cite web | url = http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/protokoll/protokoll_00R.pdf | title = Beslut 2014-09-20 | language = Swedish | publisher = [[Election Authority (Sweden)|Election Authority]] | accessdate = 8 November 2014}}</ref> The non-aligned Sweden Democrats more than doubled their support and won the remaining 49 seats.<ref name="2014 Election Result" /> On 3 October 2014, Stefan Löfven, formed a [[minority government]] consisting of the [[Löfven Cabinet|Social Democrats and the Greens]].<ref name="Sweden's new Government">{{cite web | url = http://www.government.se/sb/d/575/a/247235 | title = Sweden's new Government | publisher = [[Government Offices of Sweden]] | accessdate = 8 November 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141006234923/http://www.government.se/sb/d/575/a/247235 | archivedate = 6 October 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref name="Change of Government Council at the Royal Palace of Stockholm">{{cite web | url = http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/royalfamily/latestnews/latestnews/changeofgovernmentcouncilattheroyalpalaceofstockholm.5.67e94750148caf4ad27127.html | title = Change of Government Council at the Royal Palace of Stockholm | publisher = [[Royal Court of Sweden]] | accessdate = 8 November 2014}}</ref>

Election turnout in Sweden has always been high by international comparison. Although it declined in recent decades, the latest elections saw an increase in voter turnout (80.11% in [[Sweden general election, 2002|2002]], 81.99% in 2006, 84.63% in 2010) and 85.81 in [[Swedish general election, 2014|2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.val.se/val/val2014/slutresultat/R/rike/index.html|title=Röster – Val 2014 | publisher = [[Election Authority (Sweden)|Election Authority]] |language=sv |access-date=15 February 2016}}</ref> Swedish politicians enjoyed a high degree of confidence from the citizens in the 1960s, However, that level of confidence has since declined steadily, and is now at a markedly lower level than in its Scandinavian neighbours.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Norris, Pippa |author=Holmberg, Sören |title=Critical Citizens: Global Support for Democratic Government|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1999|pages=103–123|isbn=978-0-19-829568-6}}</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Counties of Sweden|Municipalities of Sweden}}
[[File:SWE-Map Kommuner2007.svg|thumb|upright|Municipal divisions of Sweden]]
Sweden is a [[unitary state]] divided into 21 county councils (''landsting'') and 290 municipalities (''kommuner''). Every county council corresponds to a [[counties of Sweden|county]] (''län'') with a number of municipalities per county. County councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government. Health care, public transport and certain cultural institutions are administered by county councils. Preschools, primary and secondary schooling, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities. Gotland is a special case of being a county council with only one municipality and the functions of county council and municipality are performed by the same organisation.<ref>Swedish Association of Local Authorities and Regions, [http://skl.se/tjanster/englishpages/municipalitiescountycouncilsandregions.1088.html Municipalities, county councils and regions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161122153331/http://skl.se/tjanster/englishpages/municipalitiescountycouncilsandregions.1088.html |date=22 November 2016 }}; official translation of the [http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/06/96/34cb7541.pdf Local Government Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220081642/http://www.regeringen.se/content/1/c4/06/96/34cb7541.pdf |date=20 February 2005 }} (''Kommunallagen'');[http://www.sll.se/om-landstinget/Information-in-English1/About-Stockholm-County-Council/ About Stockholm County Council] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821160842/http://www.sll.se/om-landstinget/Information-in-English1/About-Stockholm-County-Council/ |date=21 August 2016}}</ref>

Municipal and county council government in Sweden is similar to [[city commission government|city commission]] and [[cabinet-style council]] government. Both levels have legislative assemblies ([[municipal council (Sweden)|municipal councils]] and county council assemblies of between 31 and 101 members (always an uneven number) that are elected from [[party-list proportional representation]] at the general election which are held every four years in conjunction with the national parliamentary elections.

Municipalities are also divided into a total of 2,512 [[Parishes of Sweden|parishes]] (''församlingar''). These have no official political responsibilities but are traditional subdivisions of the [[Church of Sweden]] and still have some importance as census districts for census-taking and elections.

The Swedish government has 21 [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Boards]] ({{lang-sv|länsstyrelser}}), which are responsible for regional state administration not assigned to other government agencies or local government. Each county administrative boards is led by a [[County governors of Sweden|County Governor]] ({{lang-sv|landshövding}}) appointed for a term of six years. The list of previous officeholders for the counties stretches back, in most cases, to 1634 when the counties were created by [[Lord High Chancellor of Sweden|Lord High Chancellor]] Count [[Axel Oxenstierna]]. The main responsibility of the County Administrative Board is to co-ordinate the development of the county in line with goals set by the Riksdag and Government.

There are older historical divisions, primarily the twenty-five provinces and three lands, which still retain cultural significance.

| &nbsp;
|How and when the Swedish kingdom appeared is not known. It is not until the 12th century that written document begin to be produced in Sweden in any larger extent […]
|}</ref> Establishing the age depends mostly on whether Sweden should be considered a nation when the ''Svear'' (Sweonas) ruled Svealand or if the emergence of the nation started with the ''Svear'' and the ''[[Götar]]'' (Geats) of Götaland being united under one ruler. In the first case, Svealand was first mentioned as having one single ruler in the year 98 by Tacitus, but it is almost impossible to know for how long it had been this way. However, historians usually start the line of [[Swedish monarchs]] from when Svealand and Götaland were ruled under the same king, namely Eric the Victorious (Geat) and his son [[Olof Skötkonung]] in the 10th century. These events are often described as the [[consolidation of Sweden]], although substantial areas were conquered and incorporated later.

Earlier kings, for which no reliable historical sources exist, can be read about in [[mythical kings of Sweden]] and [[semi-legendary kings of Sweden]]. Many of these kings are only mentioned in various [[Norse sagas|saga]] and blend with Norse mythology.

The title ''Sveriges och Götes Konung'' was last used for [[Gustaf I of Sweden]], after which the title became "[[Kings of Sweden|King of Sweden]], [[King of the Goths|of the Goths]] and [[King of the Wends|of the Wends]]" (''Sveriges, Götes och Vendes Konung'') in official documentation. Up until the beginning of the 1920s, all laws in Sweden were introduced with the words, "We, the king of Sweden, of the Goths and Wends". This title was used up until 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lagen.nu/1973:702|title=Kungl. Maj:ts kungörelse med anledning av konung Gustaf VI Adolfs frånfälle|publisher=Lagen.nu |accessdate=17 September 2014 |language=sv}}</ref> The present King of Sweden, Carl XVI Gustaf, was the first monarch officially proclaimed "King of Sweden" (''Sveriges Konung'') with no additional peoples mentioned in his title.

The term ''riksdag'' was used for the first time in the 1540s, although the first meeting where representatives of different social groups were called to discuss and determine affairs affecting the country as a whole took place as early as 1435, in the town of [[Arboga]].<ref name=Riksdagen>{{cite web|title=The history of the Riksdag|url=http://www.riksdagen.se/en/How-the-Riksdag-works/Democracy/The-history-of-the-Riksdag/|publisher=[[Riksdag]] |accessdate=9 June 2013}}</ref> During the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag assemblies]] of 1527 and 1544, under King [[Gustav Vasa]], representatives of all four [[estates of the realm]] (clergy, [[Swedish nobility|nobility]], [[Bourgeoisie|townsmen]] and [[peasant]]s) were called on to participate for the first time.<ref name="Riksdagen" /> The monarchy became hereditary in 1544.

Executive power was historically shared between the King and an aristocratic [[Privy council]] until 1680, followed by the King's [[autocracy|autocratic rule]] initiated by the commoner estates of the Riksdag. As a reaction to the failed Great Northern War, a parliamentary system was introduced in 1719, followed by three different flavours of constitutional monarchy in 1772, 1789 and 1809, [[Swedish constitution of 1809|the latter]] granting several civil liberties. Already during the first of those three periods, the 'Era of Liberty' (1719–72) the Swedish Rikstag had developed into a very active Parliament, and this tradition continued into the nineteenth century, laying the basis for the transition towards modern democracy at the end of that century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy. From 1500 to the Present.|date=2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=22|isbn=9781107507180}}</ref>

In 1866 Sweden became a constitutional monarchy with a [[bicameral]] parliament, with the First Chamber indirectly elected by local governments, and the Second Chamber directly elected in national elections every four years. In 1971 the parliament became unicameral. Legislative power was (symbolically) shared between the King and the Riksdag until 1975. Swedish taxation is controlled by the Riksdag.

Sweden has a history of strong political involvement by ordinary people through its "popular movements" (''Folkrörelser''), the most notable being trade unions, the independent Christian movement, the temperance movement, the [[women's movement]], and the [[Pirate Party (Sweden)|intellectual property pirate]] movements. Sweden was the first country in the world to outlaw [[corporal punishment]] of children by their parents (parents' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979<ref name="Durrant 1996">{{cite book |last=Durrant |first=Joan E. |editor1=Frehsee, Detlev  |display-editors=etal|title=Family Violence Against Children: A Challenge for Society |date=1996 |location=Berlin |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |isbn=978-3-11-014996-8 |page=20 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Family_Violence_Against_Children.html?id=8IyJkWAAXjkC&q=%22swedish+ban+on+corporal+punishment%22 |chapter=The Swedish Ban on Corporal Punishment: Its History and Effects}}</ref>).

=== Judicial system ===
{{Main|Judiciary of Sweden}}
The courts are divided into two parallel and separate systems: The general courts ({{lang|sv|allmänna domstolar}}) for criminal and civil cases, and general administrative courts ({{lang|sv|allmänna förvaltningsdomstolar}}) for cases relating to disputes between private persons and the authorities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dom.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2317.aspx |publisher=[[Swedish National Courts Administration]] |title=The Swedish courts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209002918/http://www.dom.se/templates/DV_InfoPage____2317.aspx |archivedate=9 February 2009|date=2005-03-10 }}</ref> Each of these systems has three tiers, where the top tier court of the respective system typically only will hear cases that may become [[precedent]]. There are also a number of special courts, which will hear a narrower set of cases, as set down by legislation. While independent in their rulings, some of these courts are operated as divisions within courts of the general or general administrative courts.

[[File:Hogsta domstolen Stockholm.jpg|thumb|[[Bonde Palace]] in Stockholm, seat of the [[Supreme Court of Sweden]]]]
The [[Supreme Court of Sweden]] ({{lang-sv|Högsta domstolen}}) is the third and final instance in all civil and criminal cases in Sweden. Before a case can be decided by the Supreme Court, leave to appeal must be obtained, and with few exceptions, leave to appeal can be granted only when the case is of interest as a precedent. The Supreme Court consists of 16 Justices ({{lang-sv|justitieråd}}), appointed by the Government, but the court as an institution is independent of the Riksdag, and the Government is not able to interfere with the decisions of the court.

According to a victimisation survey of 1,201 residents in 2005, Sweden has above-average [[crime rate]]s compared to other EU countries. Sweden has high or above-average levels of assaults, sexual assaults, hate crimes, and consumer fraud. Sweden has low levels of burglary, car theft and drug problems.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Sweden}}
[[File:European-parliament-brussels-inside.JPG|thumb|The EU parliament in Brussels. Sweden is one of 28 member states of the European Union.]]

Throughout the 20th century, [[Swedish foreign policy]] was based on the principle of non-alignment in peacetime and [[neutral country|neutrality]] in wartime. Sweden's government pursued an independent course of nonalignment in times of peace so that neutrality would be possible in the event of war.<ref name="NB335-339" />

Sweden's doctrine of neutrality is often traced back to the 19th century as the country has not been in a [[war|state of war]] since the end of the [[Swedish campaign against Norway (1814)|Swedish campaign against Norway]] in 1814. During World War II Sweden joined neither the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] nor [[Axis powers|axis]] powers. This has sometimes been disputed since in effect Sweden allowed in select cases the Nazi regime to use its railroad system to transport troops and goods,<ref name="Koblik303-313" /><!---Koblik, p. 313---><ref name="NB313-319" /> especially iron ore from mines in northern Sweden, which was vital to the German war machine.<ref name="NB313-319" /><ref>Nordstrom p. 302: "In fact, the plans were mostly a ruse to establish control of the crucial Norwegian port of Narvik and the iron mines of northern Sweden, which were vitally important to the German war efforts."</ref> However, Sweden also indirectly contributed to the defence of Finland in the Winter War, and permitted the training of Norwegian and Danish troops in Sweden after 1943.

[[File:ODA percent of GNI 2009.png|thumb|left|[[Official development assistance|Development aid]] measured in [[Gross national income|GNI]] in 2009. Source: OECD. As a percentage Sweden is the largest donor.]]

During the early [[Cold War]] era, Sweden combined its policy of non-alignment and a low profile in international affairs with a [[security policy]] based on strong [[National security|national defence]].<ref>As context, according to [[Edwin Reischauer]], "To be neutral you must be ready to be highly militarized, like Switzerland or Sweden." – ''see'' {{cite news |last=Chapin |first=Emerson |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE2DC163AF931A3575AC0A966958260&scp=1&sq=edwin+o+reischauer&st=nyt |title=Edwin Reischauer, Diplomat and Scholar, Dies at 79 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2 September 1990 |access-date=16 February 2016}}</ref> The function of the Swedish military was to deter attack.<ref>Nordstrom, p 336: "As a corollary, a security policy based on strong national defences designed to discourage, but not prevent, attack was pursued. For the next several decades, the Swedish poured an annual average of about 5% of GDP into making their defenses credible."</ref> At the same time, the country maintained relatively close informal connections with the Western bloc, especially in the realm of intelligence exchange. In 1952, a Swedish [[DC-3]] was [[Catalina affair|shot down]] over the Baltic Sea by a Soviet [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] [[jet aircraft|jet]] [[fighter aircraft|fighter]]. Later investigations revealed that the plane was actually gathering information for NATO.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cold War Spy Plane Found in Baltic Sea|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/10/1010_031010_swedishspyplane.html|publisher=[[National Geographic News]]|accessdate=10 June 2013|date=10 October 2003}}</ref> Another plane, a [[PBY Catalina|Catalina]] [[search and rescue]] plane, was sent out a few days later and shot down by the Soviets as well. Prime Minister Olof Palme made an official visit to [[Cuba]] during the 1970s, during which he denounced [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s government and praised contemporary [[26 July Movement|Cuban]] and [[Khmer Rouge|Cambodian]] revolutionaries in a speech.

Beginning in the late 1960s, Sweden attempted to play a more significant and independent role in international relations. It involved itself significantly in international peace efforts, especially through the United Nations, and in support to the [[Third World]].

On 27 October 1981, a [[Whiskey-class submarine]] ([[Soviet submarine S-363|''U 137'']]) from the [[Soviet Union]] ran aground close to the [[Karlskrona naval base|naval base]] at [[Karlskrona]] in the southern part of the country. Research has never clearly established whether the submarine ended up on the shoals through a navigational mistake or if an enemy committed espionage against Swedish military potential. The incident triggered a diplomatic crisis between Sweden and the Soviet Union. Following the [[Assassination of Olof Palme|1986 assassination of Olof Palme]] and with the end of the Cold War, Sweden has adopted a more traditional foreign policy approach. Nevertheless, the country remains active in peace keeping missions and maintains a considerable foreign aid budget.

Since 1995 Sweden has been a member of the European Union, and as a consequence of a new world security situation the country's foreign policy doctrine has been partly modified, with Sweden playing a more active role in European security co-operation.

[[File:Swedish JAS-39 Gripen landing.jpg|thumb|The Saab [[JAS 39 Gripen]] is an advanced Swedish multi-role [[fighter aircraft]] of the [[Swedish Air Force]].]]
The [[Law enforcement in Sweden|law is enforced in Sweden]] by several government entities. The Swedish police is a [[Government agencies in Sweden|Government agency]] concerned with police matters. The [[National Task Force]] is a national [[SWAT]] unit within the Police Service. The [[Swedish Security Service]]'s responsibilities are [[counter-espionage]], anti-terrorist activities, protection of the constitution and protection of sensitive objects and people.

''Försvarsmakten'' (Swedish Armed Forces) is a government agency reporting to the Swedish [[Ministry of Defence (Sweden)|Ministry of Defence]] and responsible for the [[peacetime]] operation of the armed forces of Sweden. The primary task of the agency is to train and deploy peace support forces abroad, while maintaining the long-term ability to refocus on the defence of Sweden in the event of war. The armed forces are divided into [[Swedish Army|Army]], [[Swedish Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Swedish Navy|Navy]]. The head of the armed forces is the [[Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces|Supreme Commander]] (''Överbefälhavaren'', ÖB), the most senior commissioned officer in the country. Up to 1974 the King was ''pro forma'' [[Commander in chief#Sweden|Commander-in-Chief]], but in reality it was clearly understood all through the 20th century that the Monarch would have no ''active'' role as a military leader.

Until the end of the Cold War, nearly all males reaching the age of [[military service]] were [[conscription|conscripted]]. In recent years, the number of conscripted males has shrunk dramatically, while the number of female volunteers has increased slightly. Recruitment has generally shifted towards finding the most motivated recruits, rather than solely those otherwise most fit for service. All soldiers serving abroad must by law be volunteers. In 1975 the total number of conscripts was 45,000. By 2003 it was down to 15,000.

On 1 July 2010 Sweden stopped routine conscription, switching to an all volunteer force unless otherwise required for defence readiness.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/Rekrytering/Varnplikt/ |publisher=[[Swedish Armed Forces]] |title=Värnplikt |trans-title=Conscription |accessdate=21 April 2010 |language=sv }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://svt.se/2.22620/1.1595556/allmanna_varnplikten_skrotas?lid=puff_1597044&lpos=extra_0 |publisher=[[Sveriges Television]] |title=Allmänna värnplikten skrotas |trans-title=General conscription scrapped |accessdate=21 April 2010 |language=sv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426203557/http://svt.se/2.22620/1.1595556/allmanna_varnplikten_skrotas?lid=puff_1597044&lpos=extra_0 |archivedate=26 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thelocal.se/21494/20090816/ |newspaper=[[The Local]] |title=Military conscription phase out under fire |accessdate=21 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122021708/http://www.thelocal.se/21494/20090816/ |archivedate=22 January 2010}}</ref> The need to recruit only the soldiers later prepared to volunteer for international service will be emphasised. The total forces gathered would consist of about 60,000 men. This could be compared with the 1980s before the fall of the Soviet Union, when Sweden could gather up to 1,000,000 men.

However, on 11 December 2014, due to tensions in the Baltic area, the [[Swedish Government]] reintroduced one part of the Swedish conscription system, [[Refresher training (military)|refresher training]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forsvarsmakten.se/sv/information-och-fakta/varnplikt/repetitionsutbildning/fragor-och-svar-om-repetitionsutbildning/|title=Frågor och svar om repetitionsutbildning|last=Försvarsmakten|website=Försvarsmakten}}</ref> On 2 March 2017 the Swedish Government decided to reintroduce the remaining part of the Swedish conscription system, the Basic Military Training. The first recruits began their training in 2018.

Sweden maintains its own currency, the [[Swedish krona]] (SEK), a result of the Swedes having rejected the [[euro]] in a referendum. The Swedish [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]]—founded in 1668 and thus the oldest central bank in the world—is currently focusing on price stability with an inflation target of 2%. According to the ''Economic Survey of Sweden 2007'' by the OECD, the average inflation in Sweden has been one of the lowest among European countries since the mid-1990s, largely because of deregulation and quick utilisation of globalisation.<ref name="oecd2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/37/0,3343,en_2649_34569_38048997_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Economic survey of Sweden 2007 |publisher=Oecd.org |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426123744/http://www.oecd.org/document/37/0%2C3343%2Cen_2649_34569_38048997_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=26 April 2011 |df=}}</ref>

The largest trade flows are with Germany, the United States, Norway, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Finland.

Financial deregulation in the 1980s impacted adversely on the property market, leading to a bubble and eventually a crash in the early 1990s. Commercial property prices fell by up to two thirds, resulting in two Swedish banks having to be taken over by the government. In the following two decades the property sector strengthened. By 2014, legislators, economists and the IMF were again warning of a bubble with residential property prices soaring and the level of personal mortgage debt expanding. Household debt-to-income rose above 170% as the IMF was calling on legislators to consider zoning reform and other means of generating a greater supply of housing as demand was outstripping what was available, pushing prices higher. By August 2014, 40% of home borrowers had interest-only loans while those that didn't were repaying principal at a rate that would take 100 years to fully repay.<ref name="SwedenProperty">{{cite news|title=Sweden facing possible property bubble warns IMF|url=http://www.swedennews.net/index.php/sid/225058369|date=24 August 2014|accessdate=26 August 2014|publisher=''Sweden News.Net''}}</ref>

Sweden's energy market is largely privatised. The [[Nordic energy market]] is one of the first liberalised energy markets in Europe and it is traded in [[NASDAQ OMX Commodities Europe]] and [[Nord Pool Spot]]. In 2006, out of a total electricity production of 139 [[TWh]], electricity from hydropower accounted for 61 TWh (44%), and [[nuclear power]] delivered 65 TWh (47%). At the same time, the use of [[biofuel]]s, [[peat]] etc. produced 13 TWh (9%) of electricity, while wind power produced 1 TWh (1%). Sweden was a net importer of electricity by a margin of 6 TWh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.svenskenergi.se/upload/Statistik/Tidigare%20statistik/Kraftl%C3%A4get%20i%20%C3%A5r/ve_07-01.pdf |title=Kraftläget i Sverige, Vattensituationen |accessdate=19 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216021232/http://www.svenskenergi.se/upload/Statistik/Tidigare%20statistik/Kraftl%C3%A4get%20i%20%C3%A5r/ve_07-01.pdf |archivedate=16 February 2008 |df= }}</ref> [[Biomass]] is mainly used to produce heat for [[district heating]] and [[central heating]] and industry processes.

The [[1973 oil crisis]] strengthened Sweden's commitment to decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. Since then, electricity has been generated mostly from hydropower and nuclear power. The use of nuclear power has been limited, however. Among other things, the accident of [[Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station]] (United States) prompted the Riksdag to ban new nuclear plants. In March 2005, an opinion poll showed that 83% supported maintaining or increasing nuclear power.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf42.html |title=Nuclear Power in Sweden |publisher=[[World Nuclear Association]] |date=September 2009 |accessdate=29 January 2010}}</ref> Politicians have made announcements about oil phase-out in Sweden, decrease of nuclear power, and multibillion-dollar investments in [[renewable energy]] and energy efficiency.<ref name="Agenda21" /><ref name="Vidal">{{cite news|last=Vidal |first=John |url=https://www.theguardian.com/oil/story/0,,1704954,00.html |title=Sweden plans to be world's first oil-free economy |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 February 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2013 |location=London}}</ref> The country has for many years pursued a strategy of indirect taxation as an instrument of [[environmental policy]], including [[energy tax]]es in general and [[carbon dioxide]] taxes in particular.<ref name="Agenda21">{{cite web |publisher=[[United Nations]] |url=https://www.un.org/esa/agenda21/natlinfo/countr/sweden/natur.htm |work=[[Agenda 21]] |title=NATURAL RESOURCE ASPECTS OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT IN SWEDEN |date=April 1997 |access-date=17 February 2016}}</ref> Sweden was in 2014 a net exporter of electricity by a margin of 16 TWh; the production from windpower mills had increased to 11.5 TWh.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.svenskenergi.se/Global/Statistik/Aktuellt%20kraftl%C3%A4ge/Aktuellt-Kraftl%C3%A4ge-Sverige-veckorapport.pdf |publisher=Svenskenergi.se |title=Kraftläget i Sverige |trans-title=Power situation in Sweden |language=sv}}</ref>

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Sweden}}
[[File:Öresundsbron i solnedgång 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Öresund Bridge]] between [[Malmö]] and [[Copenhagen]] in Denmark]]

Sweden has {{convert|162707|km|mi|abbr=on}} of paved road and {{convert|1428|km|mi|abbr=on}} of expressways. [[List of motorways in Sweden|Motorways]] run through Sweden and over the Øresund Bridge to Denmark. New motorways are still under construction and a new motorway from Uppsala to [[Gävle]] was finished on 17 October 2007. Sweden had left-hand traffic (Vänstertrafik in Swedish) from approximately 1736 and continued to do so well into the 20th century. Voters rejected right-hand traffic in 1955, but after the Riksdag passed legislation in 1963 changeover took place on 3 September 1967, known in Swedish as [[Dagen H]].

The [[Stockholm metro]] is the only underground system in Sweden and serves the city of Stockholm via 100 stations. The rail transport market is privatised, but while there are many privately owned enterprises, the largest operators are still owned by state. The counties have financing, ticket and marketing responsibility for local trains. For other trains the operators handle tickets and marketing themselves. Operators include [[SJ AB|SJ]], [[Veolia Transport]], [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], [[Green Cargo]], [[Tågkompaniet]] and [[Inlandsbanan]]. Most of the railways are owned and operated by [[Trafikverket]]. Most tram nets were closed in 1967, as Sweden changed from left-side to right-side driving, but they survived in [[Norrköping]], Gothenburg and Stockholm. A new tram line is set to open in [[Lund]] in 2019.

[[File:Hall, Stockholm Central Station.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stockholm Central Station]]]]

The largest airports include [[Stockholm–Arlanda Airport]] (16.1 million passengers in 2009) {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Stockholm, [[Göteborg Landvetter Airport]] (4.3 million passengers in 2008), and [[Stockholm–Skavsta Airport]] (2.0 million passengers). Sweden hosts the two largest port companies in Scandinavia, [[Port of Gothenburg|Port of Göteborg AB]] (Gothenburg) and the transnational company [[Copenhagen Malmö Port|Copenhagen Malmö Port AB]]. The most used airport for a large part of Southern Sweden is [[Copenhagen Airport|Kastrup or Copenhagen Airport]] which is located only 12 minutes by train from the closest Swedish railway station, [[Hyllie railway station|Hyllie]]. Copenhagen Airport also is the largest ''international'' airport in Scandinavia and Finland.

Sweden also has a number of car ferry connections to several neighbouring countries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ferrylines.com/en/ferries/baltic-sea/|title=Ferry to Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Baltic, Russia, Germany.|last=Kowalski|first=Oliver|website=www.ferrylines.com|access-date=28 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816025904/http://www.ferrylines.com/en/ferries/baltic-sea|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This includes a route from [[Umeå]] across [[Kvarken|the Gulf of Bothnia]] to [[Vaasa]] in Finland. There are several connections from the Stockholm area across the [[Sea of Åland]] to [[Mariehamn]] in the [[Åland Islands]] as well as [[Turku]] and [[Helsinki]] on the Finnish mainland and beyond to Estonia and [[Saint Petersburg|St Petersburg]] in Russia. Ferry routes from the Stockholm area also connect with [[Ventspils]] and [[Riga]] in Latvia as well as [[Gdańsk]] in Poland across the Baltic Sea. The ferry ports of [[Karlskrona]] and [[Karlshamn]] in southeastern Sweden serve [[Gdynia]], Poland, and [[Klaipėda|Klaipeda]], Lithuania. Ystad and Trelleborg near the southern tip of Sweden have ferry links with the Danish island of [[Bornholm]] and the German ports of [[Sassnitz]], [[Rostock]] and [[Travemünde]], respectively, and ferries run to [[Świnoujście]], Poland, from both of them. Trelleborg is the busiest ferry port in Sweden in terms of weight transported by lorry.<ref>John Bitton and Nils-Åke Svensson, "Øresund sett från himlen" (Oresund seen from the sky), 2005, {{ISBN|918530510-3}}, page 38</ref> Its route to Sassnitz started as a steam-operated railway ferry in the 19th century, and today's ferry still carries trains to [[Berlin]] during the summer months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snalltaget.se/om-oss/destinationer/berlin|title=Tåg till Berlin – Berlin Night Express – Nattåg till Berlin InterRail – Snälltåget|publisher=Snälltåget.se|language=sv}}</ref> Another ferry route to Travemünde originates from [[Malmö]]. Despite the opening of the fixed link to Denmark, the [[Øresund Bridge]], the busiest ferry route remains the short link across the narrowest section of the [[Øresund]] between [[Helsingborg]] and the Danish port of [[Helsingør]], known as the [[HH Ferry route]].

Finally, there are ferries from [[Strömstad]] near the Norwegian border to destinations around the [[Oslofjord]] in Norway. There used to be ferry services to the [[United Kingdom]] from Göteborg to destinations such as Immingham, Harwich and Newcastle, but these have been discontinued.

Sweden has two domestic ferry lines with large vessels, both connecting Gotland with the mainland. The lines leave from Visby harbour on the island, and the ferries sail to either [[Oskarshamn]] or Nynäshamn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destinationgotland.se/Farja/|title=Boka båtbiljetter till och från Gotland|work=destinationgotland.se |language=sv}}</ref> A smaller car ferry connects the island of [[Ven (Sweden)|Ven]] in Øresund with [[Landskrona]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ventrafiken.se/index.php/en/|title=Ventrafiken -Upplev sundets pärla|work=ventrafiken.se |language=sv}}</ref>

=== Public policy ===
{{See also|Nordic model|Social welfare in Sweden}}
Sweden has one of the most highly developed welfare states in the world. According to a 2012 OECD report, the country had the second-highest public social spending as a percentage of its GDP after France (27.3% and 28.4%, respectively), and the third-highest total (public and private) social spending at 30.2% of its GDP, after France and [[Belgium]] (31.3% and 31.0%, respectively).<ref>{{cite web|title=OECD Factbook 2011–2012 (see Public Finance -> Social Expenditure) |year=2012 |publisher=OECD Publishing |url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-factbook_18147364}}</ref> Sweden spent 6.3% of its GDP, the 9th-highest among 34 OECD countries, to provide equal access to education.<ref>{{cite web|title=OECD Factbook 2011–2012 (see Education -> Education Expenditure) |year=2012 |publisher=OECD Publishing |url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-factbook_18147364}}</ref> On health care, the country spent 10.0% of its total GDP, the 12th highest.<ref>{{cite web |title=OECD Factbook 2011–2012 (see Health -> Health Expenditure) |year=2012 |publisher=OECD Publishing |url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-factbook_18147364}}</ref>

Historically, Sweden provided solid support for [[free trade]] (except agriculture) and mostly relatively strong and stable property rights (both private and public), though some economists have pointed out that Sweden promoted industries with tariffs and used publicly subsidised R&D during the country's early critical years of industrialisation.<ref name="H-J.C-Sweden">{{cite book |title=Kicking Away The Ladder |pages=39–42 |first=Ha-Joon |last=Chang}}</ref> After World War II a succession of governments expanded the welfare state by raising the taxes. During this period Sweden's economic growth was also one of the highest in the industrial world. A series of successive social reforms transformed the country into one of the most equal and developed on earth. The consistent growth of the welfare state led to Swedes achieving unprecedented levels of social mobility and quality of life—to this day Sweden consistently ranks at the top of league tables for health, literacy and Human Development—far ahead of some wealthier countries (for example the United States).<ref name="Equal Societies">{{cite web |url=http://www.health.gov.au/internet/nhhrc/publishing.nsf/Content/135-interim/$FILE/135%20-%20Submission%20-%20Childrens%20Hospitals%20Australasia%20(Attachment%20C).pdf |publisher=[[Department of Health (Australia)|Department of Health]] |title=The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better |first1=Richard |last1=Wilkinson |first2=Kate |last2=Pickett |date=8 March 2009 |access-date=16 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205120331/http://www.health.gov.au/internet/nhhrc/publishing.nsf/Content/135-interim/$FILE/135%20-%20Submission%20-%20Childrens%20Hospitals%20Australasia%20(Attachment%20C).pdf |archivedate=5 February 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Sweden began slowing the expansion of the welfare state in the 1980s, and even trimming it back.

Sweden adopted free market agricultural policies in 1990. Since the 1930s, the agricultural sector had been subject to price controls. In June 1990, the Riksdag voted for a new agricultural policy marking a significant shift away from price controls. As a result, food prices fell somewhat. However, the liberalisations soon became moot because EU agricultural controls supervened.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Econ Journal Watch]] |last=Lindberg |first=Henrik |title=The Role of Economists in Liberalising Swedish Agriculture |date=May 2007 |url=http://econjwatch.org/issues/volume-4-number-1-may-2007 |volume=4 |issue=2 |access-date=17 February 2016}}</ref>

Since the late 1960s, Sweden has had the highest tax quota (as percentage of GDP) in the industrialised world, although today the gap has narrowed and Denmark has surpassed Sweden as the most heavily taxed country among developed countries. Sweden has a two-step [[progressive tax]] scale with a municipal income tax of about 30% and an additional high-income state tax of 20–25% when a salary exceeds roughly 320,000 SEK per year. [[Payroll tax]]es amount to 32%. In addition, a national [[Value added tax|VAT]] of 25% is added to many things bought by private citizens, with the exception of food (12% VAT), transportation, and books (6% VAT). Certain items are subject to additional taxes, e.g. electricity, petrol/diesel and alcoholic beverages.

=== Science and technology ===
{{Main|Swedish inventions}}
[[File:AlfredNobel adjusted.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alfred Nobel]], inventor of dynamite and institutor of the Nobel Prize]]

In the 18th century Sweden's [[scientific revolution]] took off. Previously, technical progress had mainly come from mainland Europe.

In 1739, the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] was founded, with people such as [[Carl Linnaeus]] and [[Anders Celsius]] as early members. Many of the companies founded by early pioneers still remain major international brands. [[Gustaf Dalén]] founded [[AGA AB|AGA]], and received the Nobel Prize for his [[sun valve]]. [[Alfred Nobel]] invented [[dynamite]] and instituted the Nobel Prizes. [[Lars Magnus Ericsson]] started the company bearing his name, Ericsson, still one of the largest telecom companies in the world. [[Jonas Wenström]] was an early pioneer in [[alternating current]] and is along with [[Serbia]]n inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] credited as one of the inventors of the three-phase electrical system.<ref name="si91e" />

The traditional engineering industry is still a major source of Swedish inventions, but pharmaceuticals, electronics and other high-tech industries are gaining ground. [[Tetra Pak]] was an invention for storing liquid foods, invented by [[Erik Wallenberg]]. [[Losec]], an ulcer medicine, was the world's best-selling drug in the 1990s and was developed by [[AstraZeneca]]. More recently [[Håkan Lans]] invented the [[Automatic Identification System]], a worldwide standard for shipping and civil aviation navigation. A large portion of the Swedish economy is to this day based on the export of technical inventions, and many large multinational corporations from Sweden have their origins in the ingenuity of Swedish inventors.<ref name="si91e">{{cite web|url = http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Research/Facts/Innovation/|title=Innovation, Science/Research: Inventing tomorrow's world |publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=27 January 2011|date=February 2010|work=Fact Sheet FS 4}}</ref>

Swedish inventors held 47,112 patents in the United States {{as of|2014|alt=in 2014}}, according to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]]. As a nation, only ten other countries hold more patents than Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/ido/oeip/taf/cst_all.htm |publisher=[[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] |title=Patents By Country, State, and Year – All Patent Types (December 2014) |access-date=17 February 2016}}</ref>

Combined, the public and the private sector in Sweden allocate over 3.5% of GDP to [[research & development]] (R&D) per year, making Sweden's investment in R&D as a percentage of GDP the second-highest in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_res_and_dev_exp_of_gdp-economy-research-development-expenditure-gdp |title=% Of GDP > Research And Development Expenditure statistics – countries compared |publisher=NationMaster|accessdate=22 September 2012}}</ref> For several decades the [[Swedish government]] has prioritised scientific and R&D activities.

=== Taxes ===
{{Main|Taxation in Sweden}}
On average, 27% of taxpayer's money in Sweden goes to education and healthcare, whereas 5% goes to the police and military, and 42% to social security.<ref>{{cite news|date=22 August 2017|title=Offentliga sektorns utgifter|url=https://www.ekonomifakta.se/Fakta/Offentlig-ekonomi/Offentlig-sektor/Offentliga-sektorns-utgifter/?graph=/10870/all/all/}}</ref>

The typical worker receives 40% of his or her labour costs after the [[tax wedge]]. Total tax collected by Sweden as a percentage of its GDP peaked at 52.3% in 1990.<ref name=oecdtax11 /> The country faced a real estate and banking crisis in 1990–1991, and consequently passed tax reforms in 1991 to implement tax rate cuts and tax base broadening over time.<ref name="AgellEnglund"/><ref name="RiksbankHeikensten"/> Since 1990, taxes as a percentage of GDP collected by Sweden have been dropping, with total tax rates for the highest income earners dropping the most.<ref name="BengtssonHolmlund"/> In 2010 45.8% of the country's GDP was collected as taxes, the second highest among OECD countries, and nearly double the percentage in the US or South Korea.<ref name=oecdtax11/>

=== Pensions ===
{{Main|Social security in Sweden}}
Every Swedish resident receives a state pension. Swedish Pensions Agency is responsible for pensions. People who have worked in Sweden, but relocated to another country, can also receive the Swedish pension. There are several types of pensions in Sweden: national retirement, occupational and private pensions. A person can receive a combination of the various types of pensions.

About 85% of the population live in urban areas.<ref name="publikationer2007">''Yearbook of Housing and Building Statistics 2007''</ref> The capital city Stockholm has a municipal population of about 950,000 (with 1.5 million in the urban area and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area). The second- and third-largest cities are Gothenburg and Malmö. Greater Gothenburg counts just over a million inhabitants and the same goes for the western part of Scania, along the [[Öresund]]. The [[Öresund Region]], the Danish-Swedish cross-border region around the Öresund that Malmö is part of, has a population of 4 million. Outside of major cities, areas with notably higher population density include the agricultural part of Östergötland, the western coast, the area around Lake Mälaren and the agricultural area around Uppsala.

Norrland, which covers approximately 60% of the Swedish territory, has a very low population density (below 5 people per square kilometre). The mountains and most of the remote coastal areas are almost unpopulated. Low population density exists also in large parts of western Svealand, as well as southern and central Småland. An area known as ''Finnveden'', which is located in the south-west of Småland, and mainly below the 57th parallel, can also be considered as almost empty of people.

Between 1820 and 1930, approximately 1.3 million Swedes, a third of the country's population, [[Swedish emigration to North America|emigrated to North America]], and most of them to the United States. There are more than 4.4 million [[Swedish Americans]] according to a 2006 US Census Bureau estimate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_06_EST_DP2&prodType=table |title=United States – Selected Social Characteristics: 2006 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref> In Canada, the community of [[Swedish Canadian|Swedish ancestry]] is 330,000 strong.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/pages/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo=PR&Code=01&Data=Count&Table=2&StartRec=1&Sort=3&Display=All&CSDFilter=5000 |publisher=[[Statistics Canada]] |title=Ethnocultural Portrait of Canada Highlight Tables, 2006 Census |accessdate=30 June 2008 |date=2008-04-02}}</ref>

Norwegians have little difficulty understanding Swedish, and Danes can also understand it, with slightly more difficulty than Norwegians. The same goes for standard Swedish speakers, who find it far easier to understand Norwegian than Danish. The [[Scanian dialects|dialects spoken in Scania]], the southernmost part of the country, are influenced by Danish because [[Skåneland|the region traditionally was a part of Denmark]] and is nowadays situated closely to it.

In varying degrees, depending largely on frequency of interaction with English, a majority of Swedes, especially those born after World War II, understand and speak English, owing to trade links, the popularity of overseas travel, a strong Anglo-American influence and the tradition of [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitling]] rather than dubbing foreign television shows and films, and the [[Germanic languages|relative similarity]] of the two languages which makes learning English easier. In a 2005 survey by [[Eurobarometer]], 89% of Swedes reported the ability to speak English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/languages/pdf/doc631_en.pdf |title=Oooops...

English became a compulsory subject for secondary school students studying [[natural science]]s as early as 1849, and has been a compulsory subject for all Swedish students since the late 1940s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_07_99/01_engelska.html |title=English spoken – fast ibland hellre än bra |publisher=[[Lund University]] newsletter 7/1999 |language=Swedish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106110733/http://www3.lu.se/info/lum/LUM_07_99/01_engelska.html |archivedate=6 January 2006 |df=}}</ref> Depending on the local school authorities, English is currently a compulsory subject between [[first grade]] and [[ninth grade]], with all students continuing in secondary school studying English for at least another year. Most students also study one and sometimes two additional languages. These include (but are not limited to) German, French and Spanish. Some Danish and Norwegian is at times also taught as part of Swedish courses for native speakers. Because of the extensive [[mutual intelligibility]] between the three continental [[Scandinavian language]]s Swedish speakers often use their native language when visiting or living in Norway or Denmark.

Before the 11th century, Swedes adhered to [[Norse paganism]], worshiping [[Æsir]] gods, with its centre at the [[temple at Uppsala|Temple in Uppsala]]. With [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation]] in the 11th century, the laws of the country changed, forbidding worship of other deities until the late 19th century. After the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1530s, a change led by [[Martin Luther]]'s Swedish associate [[Olaus Petri]], the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] was abolished and [[Lutheranism]] became widespread. Adoption of Lutheranism was completed by the [[Uppsala Synod]] of 1593, and it became the official religion. During the era following the Reformation, usually known as the period of [[Lutheran orthodoxy]], small groups of non-Lutherans, especially [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] [[Dutch people|Dutchmen]], the [[Moravian Church]] and [[French Huguenots]] played a significant role in trade and industry, and were quietly tolerated as long as they kept a low religious profile.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gritsch|first1=Eric|title=A History of Lutheranism|date=2010|publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=9781451407754|pages=351|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ApWxByVqe-MC&dq=lutheranism+history+in+sweden|accessdate=20 March 2017}}</ref> The [[Sami people|Sami]] originally had their own [[Animism|shamanistic religion]], but they were converted to Lutheranism by Swedish missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries.

With religious liberalisations in the late 18th century believers of other faiths, including [[History of the Jews in Sweden|Judaism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]], were allowed to live and work freely in the country. However, until 1860 it remained illegal for Lutherans to convert to another religion. The 19th century saw the arrival of various [[Low church|evangelical]] [[free church]]es, and, towards the end of the century, [[secularism]], leading many to distance themselves from church rituals. Leaving the Church of Sweden became legal with the so-called dissenter law of 1860, but only under the provision of entering another [[Christian denomination]]. The right to stand outside any religious denomination was formally established in the Law on [[Freedom of religion]] in 1951.

=== Health ===
{{See also|Healthcare in Sweden|Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare}}
Healthcare in Sweden is similar in quality to other developed nations. Sweden ranks in the top five countries with respect to low [[infant mortality]]. It also ranks high in [[life expectancy]] and in safe [[drinking water]]. A person seeking care first contacts a clinic for a doctor's appointment, and may then be referred to a specialist by the clinic physician, who may in turn recommend either in-patient or out-patient treatment, or an elective care option. The health care is governed by the 21 [[County Councils of Sweden|landsting]] of Sweden and is mainly funded by taxes, with nominal fees for patients.

=== Immigration ===
{{Main|Immigration to Sweden}}

Immigration has been a major source of [[population growth]] and cultural change throughout much of the [[history of Sweden]], and in recent centuries the country has been transformed from a nation of net emigration, ending after World War I, to a nation of net immigration, from World War II onwards. The economic, social, and political aspects of immigration have caused controversy regarding ethnicity, economic benefits, jobs for non-immigrants, settlement patterns, impact on upward [[social mobility]], crime, and voting behaviour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/special-report/21570836-immigration-and-growing-inequality-are-making-nordics-less-homogeneous-ins-and |title=Immigrants: The ins and the outs |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=2 February 2013|accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref>

There are no exact numbers on the [[ethnicity|ethnic]] background of migrants and their descendants in Sweden because the Swedish government does not base any statistics on ethnicity. This is, however, not to be confused with the migrants' [[Nationality|national backgrounds]], which are recorded.

Sweden has many authors of worldwide recognition including [[August Strindberg]], [[Astrid Lindgren]], and Nobel Prize winners [[Selma Lagerlöf]] and [[Harry Martinson]]. In total seven [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prizes in Literature]] have been awarded to Swedes. The nation's most well-known artists are painters such as [[Carl Larsson]] and [[Anders Zorn]], and the sculptors [[Tobias Sergel]] and [[Carl Milles]].

Swedish 20th-century culture is noted by pioneering works in the early days of cinema, with [[Mauritz Stiller]] and [[Victor Sjöström]]. In the 1920s–1980s, the filmmaker [[Ingmar Bergman]] and actors [[Greta Garbo]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]] became internationally noted people within cinema. More recently, the films of [[Lukas Moodysson]], [[Lasse Hallström]], and [[Ruben Östlund]] have received international recognition.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s Sweden was seen as an international leader in what is now referred to as the "[[sexual revolution]]", with gender equality having particularly been promoted.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Reading/The-Swedish-myths-True-false-or-somewhere-in-between/ |title=The Swedish Myths: True, False, or Somewhere In Between? |publisher=Sweden.se |accessdate=27 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917004928/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Lifestyle/Reading/The-Swedish-myths-True-false-or-somewhere-in-between/ |archivedate=17 September 2010}}</ref> The early Swedish film ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'' (1967) reflected a liberal view of sexuality, including scenes of love making that caught international attention, and introduced the concept of the "Swedish sin" that had been introduced earlier in the US with Ingmar Bergman's ''[[Summer with Monika]].''

The image of "hot love and cold people" emerged. Sexual liberalism was seen as part of modernisation process that by breaking down traditional borders would lead to the emancipation of natural forces and desires.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Carl |last1= Marklund |title=Hot Love and Cold People.

Sweden has also become very liberal towards homosexuality, as is reflected in the popular acceptance of films such as ''[[Fucking Åmål|Show Me Love]]'', which is about two young lesbians in the small Swedish town of Åmål. Since 1 May 2009, Sweden repealed its "registered partnership" laws and fully replaced them with [[gender-neutral marriage]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Sweden passes new gay marriage law |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=2 April 2009 |url=http://www.thelocal.se/18608/20090402/ |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410151816/http://www.thelocal.se/18608/20090402/ |archivedate=10 April 2009}}</ref> Sweden also offers [[domestic partnership]]s for both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Cohabitation (''sammanboende'') by couples of all ages, including teenagers as well as elderly couples, is widespread. As of 2009, Sweden is experiencing a baby boom.<ref>{{cite web|title=Babyboom i Sverige? |url=http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____231102.aspx |language=Swedish |publisher=[[Statistics Sweden]] |accessdate=5 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090730195209/http://www.scb.se/Pages/TableAndChart____231102.aspx |archivedate=30 July 2009}}</ref>

[[File:ABBA - TopPop 1974 5.png|thumb|upright|left|The Swedish band [[ABBA]] in April 1974, a few days after they won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|Eurovision Song Contest]]]]
Historical re-creations of Norse music have been attempted based on instruments found in Viking sites. The instruments used were the ''[[lur]]'' (a sort of trumpet), simple string instruments, wooden flutes and drums. Sweden has a significant [[Music of Sweden|folk-music]] scene. There is Sami music, called the ''[[joik]]'', which is a type of chant which is part of the traditional Sami animistic spirituality. Notable composers include [[Carl Michael Bellman]] and [[Franz Berwald]].

Sweden also has a prominent choral music tradition. Out of a population of 9.5 million, it is estimated that five to six hundred thousand people sing in choirs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Colin |year=2003 |title=Choral Conducting: philosophy and practice |publisher=Routledge |pages=46–47 |isbn=978-0-415-94356-7 |quote=Sweden has a strong and enviable choral singing tradition.

With ABBA, Sweden entered into a new era, in which [[Swedish pop music]] gained international prominence.
[[File:GoteborgsOperan.jpg|thumb|left|The [[The Göteborg Opera|Gothenburg Opera House]]]]
There have been many other internationally successful bands since, such as [[Roxette]], [[Ace of Base]], [[Europe (band)|Europe]], [[A-teens]], [[The Cardigans]], [[Robyn]], [[The Hives]] and [[Soundtrack of Our Lives]], to name some of the biggest.

Sweden has also become known for a large number of [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, including [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Opeth]], [[Amon Amarth]] and [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]]. The renowned [[Neo-classical metal|neo-classical power metal]] guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]] is also from Sweden.

Starting in the 1990s, [[Denniz Pop]]'s [[Cheiron Studios]] became an international hit factory, with his disciple [[Max Martin]] responsible for [[Britney Spears]]' breakthrough songs and for shaping the whole boy-band boom at the turn of the millennium with global hits for groups like the [[Backstreet Boys]] and [['N Sync]]. In the mid-2000s, Martin came back with a more rock-tinged sound and produced major hits with artists such as [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]] and [[Katy Perry]]. Another producer worth mentioning is [[RedOne]], a Moroccan-Swede who is the creator of a slew of hits for [[Lady Gaga]].

[[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden]] is one of the most successful competing nations at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], with a total of six victories in the contest (1974, 1984, 1991, 1999, 2012 and 2015), right behind Ireland who have seven wins. In the Eurovision Song Contest each participating country submits an original song to be performed on live television and radio; however, no restriction on the nationality of the songwriter or the artist exists which has resulted in countries being represented by songwriters and artist who are not nationals of that country. In recent years Swedish songwriters have been involved in the writing – entirely or partly – of entries from several countries in addition to Sweden. For instance, in the 2012 edition of Eurovision Song Contest, Swedish songwriters and producers featured in 10 out of the 42 songs that qualified for the contest; in 2013, the numbers were 7 songs out of the 39 songs in the contest; in 2014, 7 songs out of 37 songs in the contest; in 2015, 8 songs out of 40 songs in the contest; in 2016, 12 songs out of 42 songs in the contest.

Sweden has a rather lively jazz scene. During the last sixty years or so it has attained a remarkably high artistic standard, stimulated by domestic as well as external influences and experiences. The Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research has published an overview of jazz in Sweden by Lars Westin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visarkiv.se/en/jazz/index.htm |title=Lars Westin: Jazz in Sweden – an overview |publisher=Visarkiv.se |accessdate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623003444/http://www.visarkiv.se/en/jazz/index.htm |archivedate=23 June 2008}}</ref>

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Sweden}}
[[File:Djurgardsbron 2008.jpg|left|thumb|[[Djurgårdsbron]]]]
Before the 13th century almost all buildings were made of timber, but a shift began towards stone. Early Swedish stone buildings are the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches on the country side. As so happens, many of them were built in Scania and are in effect Danish churches. This would include the [[Lund Cathedral]] from the 11th century and the somewhat younger church in [[Dalby, Lund|Dalby]], but also many early [[Gothic (architecture)|Gothic]] churches built through influences of the Hanseatic League, such as in Ystad, Malmö and Helsingborg.

Cathedrals in other parts of Sweden were also built as seats of Sweden's bishops. The [[Skara Cathedral]] is of bricks from the 14th century, and the [[Uppsala Cathedral]] in the 15th. In 1230 the foundations of the [[Linköping]] Cathedral were made, the material was there [[limestone]], but the building took some 250 years to finish.

Among older structures are also some significant fortresses and other historical buildings such as at [[Borgholm Castle]], [[Halltorps Manor]] and [[Eketorp]] fortress on the island Öland, the [[Nyköping]] fortress and the [[Visby city wall]].

[[File:Kalmar domkyrka 002.jpg|thumb|[[Kalmar Cathedral]]]]
Around 1520 Sweden was out of the [[Middle Ages]] and united under King Gustav Vasa, who immediately initiated grand mansions, castles and fortresses to be built. Some of the more magnificent include the Kalmar fortress, the [[Gripsholm Castle]] and the one at [[Vadstena]].

In the next two centuries, Sweden was designated by [[Baroque architecture]] and later the [[rococo]]. Notable projects from that time include the city Karlskrona, which has now also been declared a World Heritage Site and the [[Drottningholm Palace]].

1930 was the year of the great Stockholm exhibition, which marked the breakthrough of [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], or "funkis" as it became known. The style came to dominate in the following decades. Some notable projects of this kind were the [[Million Programme]], offering affordable living in large apartment complexes.

===Media===
{{Main|Media in Sweden}}
[[File:Sveriges Television, 2.jpg|thumb|Headquarters of [[Sveriges Television]] in Stockholm]]
Swedes are among the greatest consumers of newspapers in the world, and nearly every town is served by a local paper. The country's main quality morning papers are ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' (liberal), ''[[Göteborgs-Posten]]'' (liberal), ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' (liberal conservative) and ''[[Sydsvenska Dagbladet]]'' (liberal). The two largest evening [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloids]] are ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' (social democratic) and ''[[Expressen]]'' (liberal). The ad-financed, free international morning paper, ''[[Metro International]]'', was founded in Stockholm, Sweden. The country's news is reported in English by, among others, ''[[The Local]]'' (liberal).<ref>{{cite book |first=Kenneth E. |last=Olson |title=The history makers;: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965 |publisher=LSU Press |year=1966 |pages=33–49}}</ref>

The public broadcasting companies held a monopoly on radio and television for a long time in Sweden. Licence funded radio broadcasts started in 1925. A second radio network was started in 1954 and a third opened 1962 in response to pirate radio stations. Non-profit [[Community radio#Sweden|community radio]] was allowed in 1979 and in 1993 commercial local radio started.

The licence-funded television service was officially launched in 1956. A second channel, [[SVT2|TV2]], was launched in 1969. These two channels (operated by [[Sveriges Television]] since the late 1970s) held a monopoly until the 1980s when cable and satellite television became available. The first Swedish language satellite service was [[TV3 (Sweden)|TV3]] which started broadcasting from London in 1987. It was followed by [[Kanal 5 (Sweden)|Kanal 5]] in 1989 (then known as Nordic Channel) and [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] in 1990.

In 1991 the government announced it would begin taking applications from private television companies wishing to broadcast on the [[terrestrial television|terrestrial network]]. TV4, which had previously been broadcasting via satellite, was granted a permit and began its terrestrial broadcasts in 1992, becoming the first private channel to broadcast television content from within the country.

Around half the population are connected to cable television. [[Digital terrestrial television in Sweden]] started in 1999 and the last analogue terrestrial broadcasts were terminated in 2007.

===Literature===
{{Main|Swedish literature}}
[[File:Portrait of August Strindberg by Richard Bergh 1905.jpg|upright|thumb|The writer and playwright [[August Strindberg]]]]

The first literary text from Sweden is the [[Rök Runestone]], carved during the Viking Age c. 800 AD. With the conversion of the land to Christianity around 1100 AD, Sweden entered the [[Middle Ages]], during which monastic writers preferred to use Latin. Therefore, there are only a few texts in the [[Swedish language#Old Swedish|Old Swedish]] from that period. Swedish literature only flourished when the Swedish language was standardised in the 16th century, a standardisation largely due to the full translation of the Bible into Swedish in 1541. This translation is the so-called [[Gustav Vasa Bible]].

With improved education and the freedom brought by [[secularisation]], the 17th century saw several notable authors develop the Swedish language further. Some key figures include [[Georg Stiernhielm]] (17th century), who was the first to write classical poetry in Swedish; [[Johan Henric Kellgren]] (18th century), the first to write fluent Swedish prose; Carl Michael Bellman (late 18th century), the first writer of [[burlesque]] ballads; and August Strindberg (late 19th century), a socio-realistic writer and playwright who won worldwide fame. The early 20th century continued to produce notable authors, such as Selma Lagerlöf, (Nobel laureate 1909), [[Verner von Heidenstam]] (Nobel laureate 1916) and [[Pär Lagerkvist]] (Nobel laureate 1951).

In recent decades, a handful of Swedish writers have established themselves internationally, including the detective novelist [[Henning Mankell]] and the writer of spy fiction [[Jan Guillou]]. The Swedish writer to have made the most lasting impression on world literature is the children's book writer Astrid Lindgren, and her books about [[Pippi Longstocking]], [[Emil i Lönneberga|Emil]], and others. In 2008, the second best-selling fiction author in the world was [[Stieg Larsson]], whose ''Millennium'' series of crime novels is being published posthumously to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2009/01/15/bestselling-fiction-authors-in-the-world-for-2008/ |title=Bestselling fiction authors in the world for 2008 |publisher=Abebooks.com}}</ref> Larsson drew heavily on the work of Lindgren by basing his central character, Lisbeth Salander, on Longstocking.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/26/stieg-larsson-thriller-novels-sweden|title=Poisoned Legacy Left By The King Of Thrillers|first=Vanessa |last=Thorpe|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 September 2014|date=2009-07-25}}</ref>

===Holidays===
{{Main|Public holidays in Sweden}}
[[File:Valborgsbrasa-1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walpurgis Night]] bonfire in Sweden]]
Apart from traditional Protestant [[Liturgical year|Christian holidays]], Sweden also celebrates some unique holidays, some of a pre-Christian tradition. They include [[Midsummer]] celebrating the summer [[solstice]]; [[Walpurgis Night]] (''Valborgsmässoafton'') on 30 April lighting bonfires; and Labour Day or Mayday on 1 May is dedicated to socialist demonstrations. The day of giver-of-light [[Saint Lucy|Saint Lucia]], 13 December, is widely acknowledged in elaborate celebrations which betoken its Italian origin and commence the month-long Christmas season.

6 June is the [[National holiday of Sweden|National Day of Sweden]] and has since 2005 been a public holiday. Furthermore, there are [[Flag days in Sweden|official flag day]] observances and a [[Namesdays in Sweden]] calendar. In August many Swedes have ''kräftskivor'' (crayfish dinner parties). [[Martin of Tours]] Eve is celebrated in [[Scania]] in November with ''Mårten Gås'' parties, where roast goose and ''[[svartsoppa]]'' ('black soup', made of goose stock, fruit, spices, spirits and goose blood) are served. The [[Sami people|Sami]], one of Sweden's indigenous minorities, have their holiday on 6 February and Scania celebrate their Scanian Flag day on the third Sunday in July.

===Cuisine===

{{Main|Swedish cuisine}}
[[File:Minibon junto a un Cinnabon classic - Panamá - 2011.jpg|thumb|The [[cinnamon roll]]s were originated in Sweden and Denmark.]]
[[File:Knaeckebroed.jpg|thumb|Swedish knäckebröd ([[crisp bread]])]]

Swedish cuisine, like that of the other [[Scandinavia]]n countries ([[Cuisine of Denmark|Denmark]], [[Cuisine of Norway|Norway]] and [[Cuisine of Finland|Finland]]), was traditionally simple. Fish (particularly [[herring]]), meat, potatoes and [[dairy products]] played prominent roles. Spices were sparse. Famous preparations include Swedish meatballs, traditionally served with gravy, boiled potatoes and [[lingonberry jam]]; pancakes; ''[[lutefisk|lutfisk]]''; and the [[smörgåsbord]], or lavish buffet. ''[[Akvavit]]'' is a popular alcoholic [[distilled beverage]], and the drinking of ''[[snaps]]'' is of cultural importance. The traditional flat and dry [[crisp bread]] has developed into several contemporary variants. Regionally important foods are the ''[[surströmming]]'' (a fermented fish) in northern Sweden and [[eel]] in Scania in southern Sweden.

Swedish traditional dishes, some of which are many hundreds of years old, others perhaps a century or less, are still a very important part of Swedish everyday meals, in spite of the fact that modern-day Swedish cuisine adopts many international dishes.

In August, at the traditional feast known as crayfish party, ''[[kräftskiva]]'', Swedes eat large amounts of [[crayfish]] boiled with dill.

===Cinema===
{{Main|Cinema of Sweden}}
Swedes have been fairly prominent in the film area through the years. A number of Swedish people have found success in Hollywood, including Ingrid Bergman, Greta Garbo and [[Max von Sydow]]. Amongst several directors who have made internationally successful films can be mentioned Ingmar Bergman, Lukas Moodysson and Lasse Hallström.

===Fashion===
Interest in fashion is big in Sweden and the country is headquartering famous brands like [[H&M|Hennes & Mauritz]] (operating as H&M), [[J. Lindeberg]] (operating as JL), [[Acne Jeans|Acne]], [[Lindex]], [[Odd Molly]], [[Cheap Monday]], [[Gant U.S.A.|Gant]], [[WESC]], [[Filippa K]], and [[Nakkna]] within its borders. These companies, however, are composed largely of buyers who import fashionable goods from throughout Europe and America, continuing the trend of Swedish business toward multinational economic dependency like many of its neighbours.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Sweden}}
[[File:Björn Borg2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Former World No. 1 tennis player [[Björn Borg]]]]
Sport activities are a national movement with half of the population actively participating in organised sporting activities. The two main spectator sports are [[Association football|football]] and [[ice hockey]]. Second to football, [[Horse#Sport|horse sports]] have the highest number of practitioners who are mostly women.{{ambiguous|date=February 2018}}<!--should probably be "most of whom are women"?--> Thereafter, golf, [[track and field]], and the [[team sport]]s of [[handball]], [[floorball]], basketball and [[bandy]] are the most popular.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The Swedish national men's ice hockey team, affectionately known as ''[[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Tre Kronor]]'' (English: [[Three Crowns]]; the national symbol of Sweden), is regarded as one of the best in the world. The team has won the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]] nine times, placing them third in the all-time medal count. Tre Kronor also won Olympic gold medals in [[Ice hockey at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994]] and [[Ice hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006]]. In 2006, Tre Kronor became the first national hockey team to win both the Olympic and world championships in the same year. The [[Sweden national football team|Swedish national football team]] has seen some success at the World Cup in the past, finishing second when they hosted the tournament in 1958, and third twice, in [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950]] and [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]]. Athletics has enjoyed a surge in popularity due to several successful athletes in recent years, such as [[Carolina Klüft]] and [[Stefan Holm]].

Sweden hosted the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics]] and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]]. Other big sports events include the [[UEFA Euro 1992]], [[1995 FIFA Women's World Cup]], [[1995 World Championships in Athletics]], [[UEFA Women's Euro 2013]], and several championships of ice hockey, [[curling]], athletics, [[skiing]], [[Bandy World Championship|bandy]], [[figure skating]] and swimming.

Successful football players include [[Gunnar Nordahl]], [[Gunnar Gren]], [[Nils Liedholm]], [[Henrik Larsson]], [[Freddie Ljungberg]], [[Caroline Seger]], [[Lotta Schelin]], [[Hedvig Lindahl]], and [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]]. Successful tennis players include former world number 1 players [[Björn Borg]], [[Mats Wilander]] and [[Stefan Edberg]]. Other famous Swedish athletes include the [[heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion and [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]]r [[Ingemar Johansson]], [[World Golf Hall of Fame]]r [[Annika Sörenstam]], and multiple World Championships and Olympics medalist in table tennis [[Jan-Ove Waldner]]. Due to its northerly latitude numerous world class winter sports athletes have come from Sweden. This includes alpine skiers [[Ingemar Stenmark]], [[Anja Pärson]] and [[Pernilla Wiberg]] as well as cross country-skiers [[Gunde Svan]], [[Thomas Wassberg]], [[Charlotte Kalla]] and [[Marcus Hellner]], all Olympic gold medalists.

In 2016 The Swedish Poker Federation (Svepof) has joined The [[International Federation of Poker]] (IFP).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pokerfed.org/2016/05/17/sweden-becomes-member-ifp-family/|title=Sweden Becomes a Member of the IFP Family|last=Goenka|first=Varun|date=17 May 2016|website=International Federation of Poker|access-date=4 July 2016}}</ref>

Following the swearing in of Saud ibn Abd al-Aziz as crown prince of [[Emirate of Diriyah|the Wahhabi]] in 1788, he moved to expand his empire eastward towards the Persian Gulf and Qatar. After defeating the Bani Khalid in 1795, the Wahhabi were attacked on two fronts. The Ottomans and [[Egypt]]ians assaulted the western front, while the Al Khalifa in Bahrain and the [[Oman]]is launched an attack against the eastern front.<ref>{{cite book|last=Casey|first=Michael S.|title=The History of Kuwait (The Greenwood Histories of the Modern Nations)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwweY4yYSMIC|publisher=Greenwood|pages=37–38|year=2007|isbn=978-0313340734}}</ref><ref name="qdl1">{{cite web|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023575945.0x0000c7|title='Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.

The Al Khalifa were effectively returned to power thereafter.<ref name="qdl1"/>

As punishment for piracy, an [[East India Company]] vessel bombarded [[Doha]] in 1821, destroying the town and forcing hundreds of residents to flee. In 1825, the [[House of Thani]] was established with Sheikh [[Mohammed bin Thani]] as the first leader.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachmideast.org/geography/qatar |title=Qatar |publisher=Teachmideast.org |date= |accessdate=27 June 2013}}</ref>

Although Qatar had the legal status of a [[dependent territory|dependency]], there was a popular sentiment of resentment against the Al Khalifa. In 1867, the Al Khalifa, along with the ruler of [[Abu Dhabi]], sent a massive naval force to [[Al Wakrah]] in an effort to crush the Qatari rebels. This resulted in the maritime [[Qatari–Bahraini War]] of 1867–1868, in which Bahraini and Abu Dhabi forces sacked and looted Doha and Al Wakrah.<ref name="Fromhertz2012">{{cite book |title = Katar'da Osmanlilar 1871–1916 |last1= Kursun|first1= Zekeriya|publisher=Turk Tarih Kurumu|year= 2004}}</ref> However, the Bahraini hostilities were in violation of the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|1820 Anglo-Bahraini Treaty]]. The joint incursion, in addition to the Qatari counterattack, prompted British political agent [[Lewis Pelly]] to impose a settlement in 1868. His mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the resulting peace treaty were milestones because they implicitly recognised the distinctness of Qatar from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani. In addition to censuring Bahrain for its breach of agreement, the British [[protectorate]] asked to negotiate with a representative from Qatar, a role which Mohammed bin Thani was selected to fulfil. The results of the negotiations left the nation with a new-found sense of political identity, although it did not gain an official standing as a protectorate until 1916.

===Ottoman rule (1871–1915)===

However, Qatari-Ottoman relations soon stagnated, and in 1882 they suffered further setbacks when the Ottomans refused to aid Al Thani in his expedition of [[Abu Dhabi]]-occupied [[Khawr al Udayd]]. In addition, the Ottomans supported the Ottoman subject Mohammed bin Abdul Wahab who attempted to supplant Al Thani as [[kaymakam]] of Qatar in 1888.<ref>Habibur Rahman, pgs.143–144</ref> This eventually led Al Thani to rebel against the Ottomans, whom he believed were seeking to usurp control of the peninsula. He resigned as kaymakam and stopped paying taxes in August 1892.<ref>Habibur Rahman, pgs.150–151</ref>

In February 1893, Mehmed Hafiz Pasha arrived in Qatar in the interests of seeking unpaid taxes and accosting Jassim bin Mohammed's opposition to proposed Ottoman administrative reforms. Fearing that he would face death or imprisonment, Jassim retreated to Al Wajbah (10&nbsp;miles west of [[Doha]]), accompanied by several tribe members. Mehmed's demand that Jassim disband his troops and pledge his loyalty to the Ottomans was met with refusal. In March, Mehmed imprisoned Jassim's brother and 13 prominent Qatari tribal leaders on the Ottoman [[corvette]] ''Merrikh'' as punishment for his insubordination. After Mehmed declined an offer to release the captives for a fee of 10,000 [[Turkish lira|liras]], he ordered a column of approximately 200 troops to advance towards Jassim's [[Al Wajbah Fort]] under the command of Yusuf Effendi, thus signalling the start of the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]].<ref name="fromherz"/>

Effendi's troops came under heavy gunfire by a sizable troop of Qatari infantry and cavalry shortly after arriving to Al Wajbah. They retreated to Shebaka fortress, where they were again forced to draw back from a Qatari incursion. After they withdrew to Al Bidda fortress, Jassim's advancing column besieged the fortress, resulting in the Ottomans' concession of defeat and agreement to relinquish their captives in return for the safe passage of Mehmed Pasha's cavalry to [[Hofuf]] by land.<ref>Habibur Rahman, p. 152</ref> Although Qatar did not gain full independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]], the result of the battle forced a treaty that would later form the basis of Qatar's emerging as an autonomous country within the empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&pID=1701 |title=Battle of Al Wajbah |publisher=Qatar Visitor |date=2 June 2007 |accessdate=22 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117024415/http://www.qatarvisitor.com/index.php?cID=439&pID=1701 |archivedate=17 January 2013  }}</ref>

===British rule (1916–1971)===
[[File:Al Zubarah (6989829695).jpg|thumb|left|[[Zubarah Fort]] built in 1938.]]
The Ottoman Empire fell into disorder after losing battles in different fronts in the [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I]]. Qatar took part in the [[Arab revolt]] against the Ottomans. The revolt was successful and Ottoman rule in the country further declined. The United Kingdom and the Ottoman Empire accorded their recognition to Sheikh [[Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani]] and his successors' right to rule over the whole of the Qatari Peninsula. The Ottomans renounced all their rights to Qatar and, following the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani (who was pro-British) forced them to abandon [[Doha]] in 1915.<ref name=diwan>{{cite web|title=Amiri Diwan – Shaikh Abdullah Bin Jassim Al Thani |url=http://www.diwan.gov.qa/english/Qatar/AbdullahBinQassim.htm |publisher=Diwan.gov.qa |accessdate=28 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210053313/http://www.diwan.gov.qa/english/qatar/AbdullahBinQassim.htm |archivedate=10 February 2012 }}</ref>

As a result of the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]], Qatar became a British protectorate on 3 November 1916. On that day, the United Kingdom signed a treaty with Sheikh Abdullah bin Jassim Al Thani to bring Qatar under its [[Trucial States|Trucial System of Administration]]. While Abdullah agreed not to enter into any relations with any other power without prior consent of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British government]], the British guaranteed the protection of Qatar from all aggression by sea.<ref name="diwan"/> On 5 May 1935, Abdullah signed another treaty with the British government which granted Qatar protection against internal and external threats.<ref name="diwan"/> Oil reserves were first discovered in 1939. However, exploitation was delayed by [[World War II]].

The influence of the [[British Empire]] started diminishing after World War&nbsp;II, particularly following the independence of India and creation of [[Pakistan]] in 1947. Oil exports began in 1949, and oil revenues became the country's main source of revenue, the pearl trade having gone into decline. These revenues were used to fund the expansion and modernisation of Qatar's infrastructure. When Britain officially announced in 1968 that it would politically disengage from the Persian Gulf in three years' time, Qatar joined talks with Bahrain and seven other [[Trucial States]] to create a federation. Regional disputes, however, persuaded Qatar and Bahrain to withdraw from the talks and become independent states separately from the Trucial States, which went on to become the [[United Arab Emirates]].

=== Independence and aftermath (1971–present) ===

On 3 November 1916, the sheikh of Qatar entered into treaty relations with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Said Zahlan |first1=Rosemarie |title=The Creation of Qatar |date=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |location=Abingdon |isbn=0-06-497965-2 |page=144 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}</ref> The treaty reserved foreign affairs and defence to the United Kingdom but allowed internal autonomy.

In 1991, Qatar played a significant role in the [[Gulf War]], particularly during the [[Battle of Khafji]] in which Qatari tanks rolled through the streets of the town and provided fire support for [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]] units that were engaging [[Iraqi Army]] troops. Qatar allowed coalition troops from Canada to use the country as an [[Canada Dry One|airbase]] to launch aircraft on [[Combat Air Patrol|CAP]] duty and also permitted air forces from the United States and France to operate in its territories.<ref name="cs1"/>

===Human rights===
{{Main|Human rights in Qatar}}

According to the [[U.S. State Department]], expatriate workers from nations throughout [[Asia]] and parts of [[Africa]] voluntarily migrate to Qatar as low-skilled labourers or domestic servants, but some subsequently face conditions indicative of involuntary servitude. Some of the more common labour rights violations include beatings, withholding of payment, charging workers for benefits for which the employer is responsible, restrictions on freedom of movement (such as the confiscation of passports, travel documents, or exit permits), arbitrary detention, threats of legal action, and sexual assault.<ref name="2011narrq">{{cite book |title = Human Trafficking Report 2011|accessdate = 21 January 2012|date = June 2011|chapter = Country Narratives|publisher = Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons, [[United States Department of State]]|url = https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/2011/164233.htm}}</ref> Many migrant workers arriving for work in Qatar have paid exorbitant fees to recruiters in their home countries.<ref name="2011narrq"/>

The Qatar Armed Forces are the military forces of Qatar. The country maintains a modest military force of approximately 11,800 men, including an army (8,500), navy (1,800) and air force (1,500). Qatar's defense expenditures accounted for approximately 4.2% of gross national product in 1993, and 1.5% of gross domestic product in 2010, the most recent year available in the SIPRI statistical database.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/Milex-share-of-GDP.pdf|title=Military expenditure by country as percentage of gross domestic product, 2003–2016|work=SIPRI}}</ref> Qatar has recently signed defense pacts with the United States and United Kingdom, as well as with France earlier in 1994. Qatar plays an active role in the collective defense efforts of the [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Cooperation Council]]; the other five members are Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the UAE, and Oman. The presence of the large [[Al Udeid Air Base]], operated by the United States and several other UN nations, provides a guaranteed source of defense and national security. In 2008 Qatar spent US$2.3 billion on military expenditures, 2.3% of the gross domestic product.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://milexdata.sipri.org |title=The SIPRI Military Expenditure Database |publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute |accessdate=29 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328072123/http://milexdata.sipri.org/ |archivedate=28 March 2010  }}</ref> Qatari special forces have been trained by [[France]] and other Western countries, and are believed to possess considerable skill.<ref name=strangepow>{{cite web|title=The Strange Power of Qatar by Hugh Eakin|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/oct/27/strange-power-qatar/?pagination=false|publisher=The New York Review of Books|accessdate=16 June 2013}}</ref> They also helped the Libyan rebels during the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|2011 Battle of Tripoli]].<ref name=strangepow/>

The [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]] (SIPRI) found that in 2010–14 Qatar was the 46th-largest arms importer in the world. However, SIPRI writes, Qatar's plans to transform and significantly enlarge its armed forces have accelerated. Orders in 2013 for 62 tanks and 24 self-propelled guns from Germany were followed in 2014 by a number of other contracts, including 24 combat helicopters and 3 [[Airborne early warning and control|early-warning-and-control]] aircraft from the US, and 2 tanker aircraft from Spain.<ref>{{cite web|title=Trends in International Arms Transfer, 2014|url=http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495|website=www.sipri.org|publisher=Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|accessdate=18 March 2015|ref=SIPRI Fact Sheet, March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319023856/http://books.sipri.org/product_info?c_product_id=495|archivedate=19 March 2015}}</ref> In 2015, Qatar was the 16th largest arms importer in the world, and in 2016, it was the 11th largest, according to SIPRI.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://armstrade.sipri.org/armstrade/page/toplist.php|title=TIV of arms imports to the top 50 largest importers, 2016-2016|work=SIPRI}}</ref>

The Qatari [[peninsula]] protrudes {{convert|100|mi|km|sigfig=2|order=flip}} into the Persian Gulf, north of Saudi Arabia. It lies between latitudes [[24th parallel north|24°]] and [[27th parallel north|27° N]], and longitudes [[50th meridian east|50°]] and [[52nd meridian east|52° E]]. Most of the country consists of a low, barren [[plain]], covered with [[sand]]. To the southeast lies the [[Khor al&nbsp;Adaid]] ("[[Inland sea (geology)|Inland Sea]]"), an area of rolling sand dunes surrounding an [[inlet]] of the Persian Gulf. There are mild winters and very hot, humid summers.

In 2012, Qatar retained its title of richest country in the world (according to per capita income) for the third time in a row, having first overtaken [[Luxembourg]] in 2010. According to the study published by the [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]-based Institute of International Finance, Qatar's per capita GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) was $106,000 (QR387,000) in 2012, helping the country retain its ranking as the world's wealthiest nation. Luxembourg came a distant second with nearly $80,000 and Singapore third with per capita income of about $61,000. The research put Qatar's GDP at $182bn in 2012 and said it had climbed to an all-time high due to soaring gas exports and high oil prices. Its population stood at 1.8 million in 2012. The same study published that Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), with assets of $115bn, was ranked 12th among the richest sovereign wealth funds in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethgreenfield/2012/02/22/the-worlds-richest-countries/ |title=The World's Richest Countries |work=Forbes}}</ref>

The country has no taxes, but authorities have announced plans to levy taxes on junk food and luxury items. The taxes would be implemented on goods that harm the human body – for example fast food, tobacco products, and soft drinks. The rollout of these initial taxes is believed to be due to the fall in oil prices and a deficit that the country faced in 2016. Additionally, the country has seen job cuts in 2016 from its petroleum companies and other sectors in the government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dohanews.co/taxes-on-junk-food-luxury-items-to-be-rolled-out-in-qatar-soon/|title=Taxes on junk food, luxury items to be rolled out in Qatar soon|date=16 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://dohanews.co/tag/layoffs/|title=layoffs Archives – Doha News|website=Doha News|accessdate=5 June 2017}}</ref>

{{As of|2012}}, Qatar has proven oil reserves of 15 billion barrels and gas fields that account for more than 13% of the global resource. As a result, it is the richest state per-capita in the world. None of its 2 million residents live below the poverty line and less than 1% are unemployed.<ref name="bdlive.co.za">{{cite web|author=Simon Lincoln Reader |url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/opinion/columnists/2013/11/12/qatar-shows-how-money-can-solve-most-problems |title=Qatar shows how money can solve most problems |publisher=Bdlive.co.za |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref>

Qatar's economy was in a downturn from 1982 to 1989. OPEC quotas on crude oil production, the [[1980s oil glut|lower price for oil]], and the generally unpromising outlook on international markets reduced oil earnings. In turn, the Qatari government's spending plans had to be cut to match lower income. The resulting recessionary local business climate caused many firms to lay off expatriate staff. With the economy recovering in the 1990s, expatriate populations, particularly from [[Egypt]] and South Asia, have grown again.

Oil production will not remain at the peak level of 500,000 barrels (80,000 m³) per day for long as the national oil fields are projected to be largely depleted by 2023. However, large natural gas reserves have been located off Qatar's northeast coast. Qatar's proved reserves of gas are the third-largest in the world, exceeding 250 trillion cubic feet (7,000&nbsp;km³). The economy was boosted in 1991 by completion of the $1.5-billion Phase I of North Field gas development. In 1996, the Qatargas project began exporting [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) to Japan. Further phases of North Field gas development costing billions of dollars are in various stages of planning and development.

Qatar's heavy industrial projects, all based in [[Umm Said]], include a refinery with a 50,000 barrels (8,000 m³) per day capacity, a fertiliser plant for urea and ammonia, a steel plant, and a petrochemical plant. All these industries use gas for fuel. Most are joint ventures between European and Japanese firms and the state-owned [[Qatar Petroleum|Qatar General Petroleum Corporation]] (QGPC). The US is the major equipment supplier for Qatar's oil and gas industry, and US companies are playing a major role in North Field gas development.<ref name="bdlive.co.za" />

Qatar's [[Qatar National Vision 2030|National Vision 2030]] has made investment in renewable resources a major goal for the country over the next two decades.<ref name="Qatar National Vision 2030" /> Qatar pursues a vigorous programme of "[[Qatarization|Qatarisation]]", under which all joint venture industries and government departments strive to move Qatari nationals into positions of greater authority. Growing numbers of foreign-educated Qataris, including many educated in the US, are returning home to assume key positions formerly occupied by expatriates. To control the influx of expatriate workers, Qatar has tightened the administration of its foreign manpower programmes over the past several years. Security is the principal basis for Qatar's strict entry and immigration rules and regulations.<ref name="bdlive.co.za" />

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Qatar}}
[[File:Hamad International Airport Doha Qatar 6.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hamad International Airport]]]]
With a fast-expanding population and substantial economic growth over the past decade, a reliable and extensive transportation network is becoming increasingly necessary within Qatar. So far the government, the primary transport developer, has done well in terms of keeping up with demand for new transportation options. In 2008 the [[Ashghal|Public Works Authority]] (Ashghal), one of the bodies that oversees infrastructure development, underwent a major reorganisation in order to streamline and modernise the authority in preparation for major project expansions across all segments in the near future. Ashghal works in tandem with the Urban Planning and Development Authority (UPDA), the body that designed the transportation master plan, instituted in March 2006 and running to 2025.

As driving is the primary mode of transport in Qatar, the road network is a major focus of the plan. Project highlights in this segment include the multibillion-dollar Doha Expressway and the [[Qatar Bahrain Causeway]], which will connect Qatar to Bahrain and Saudi Arabia and is considered a milestone in regional interconnectivity.

Mass-transit options, such as a [[Doha metro]], light-rail system and more extensive bus networks, are also under development to ease road congestion. In addition, the railway system is being significantly expanded and could eventually form an integral part of a GCC-wide network linking all the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The airport, too, is expanding capacity to keep up with rising visitor numbers.

[[Hamad International Airport]] is the [[international airport]] of [[Doha]]. In 2014 replaced the former [[Doha International Airport]] as Qatar's principal airport. In 2016, the airport was named the [[List of busiest airports by passenger traffic|50th busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic]], serving 37,283,987 passengers, a 20.2% increase from 2015.

[[Hamad Port]] is Qatar's main seaport, located south of [[Doha]] in the Umm Al-Houl area. Construction of the port began in 2010; it became operational in December 2016.<ref name="dn1"/> It was officially opened in September 2017, and is expected to become fully operational by 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/video/news/2017/09/qatar-emir-officially-inaugurates-hamad-port-170905110351179.html|title=Qatar's emir officially inaugurates Hamad Port|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=5 September 2017|accessdate=5 September 2017}}</ref> Capable of handling up to 7.8 million tonnes of products annually, the bulk of trade which passes through the port consists of food and building materials.<ref name="reuters1">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-gulf-qatar-port-idUKKBN19624H|title=Gulf crisis a "blessing in disguise" for Qatar seaport|author=John Davison|publisher=Reuters|date=15 June 2017|accessdate=23 July 2017}}</ref> On the northern coast, [[Ras Laffan Industrial City#Port of Ras Laffan|Ras Laffan Port]] serves as the most extensive LNG exporting facility in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/sea-change-state%E2%80%99s-port-facilities-capacity-and-transport-links-are-being-strengthened|title=Qatar strengthens port facilities, capacity and transport links|publisher=Oxford Business Group|year=2016|accessdate=6 October 2018}}</ref>

{{main|Demographics of Qatar}}
{{wide image|The Doha city skyline, featuring post-modern structures, view from Al Corniche.jpg|1000px|Skyline of [[Doha]]}}
The number of people in Qatar fluctuates considerably depending on the season, since the country relies heavily on migrant labour. In early 2017, Qatar's total population was 2.6 million, with non-Arab foreigners making up a vast majority of Qatar's population. Only 313,000 of the population (12%) were Qatari citizens, while the remaining 2.3 million (88%) were [[expatriates]].<ref name="pop" />

The combined number of [[South Asia]]ns (from the countries of the [[Indian subcontinent]] including Sri Lanka) by themselves represent over 1.5 million people (60%) of Qatar's population. Among these, [[Indians in Qatar|Indians]] are the largest community, numbering 650,000 in 2017,<ref name="pop" /> followed by 350,000 [[Nepalis in Qatar|Nepalis]], 280,000 [[Bangladeshis]], 145,000 [[Sri Lankans]], and 125,000 [[Pakistanis in Qatar|Pakistanis]]. The contingent of expatriates which are not of South Asian origin represent around 28% of Qatar's population, of which the largest group is 260,000 [[Filipinos in Qatar|Filipinos]] and 200,000 [[Egyptians]], plus many other nationalities (including nationals of other Arab countries, Europeans, etc.).<ref name="pop" />

===Literature===
{{Main|Qatari literature}}
[[File:Qatar National Library 2.jpg|thumb|[[Qatar National Library]] in Doha]]
Qatari literature traces its origins back to the 19th century. Originally, written [[poetry]] was the most common form of expression. Abdul Jalil Al-Tabatabai and Mohammed bin Abdullah bin Uthaymeen, two poets dating back to the early 19th century, formed the corpus of Qatar's earliest written poetry. Poetry later fell out of favor after Qatar began reaping the profits from oil exports in the mid-20th century and many Qataris abandoned their [[Bedouin]] traditions in favor of more urban lifestyles.<ref name="tawfiq">{{cite web|url=http://aljasra.org/archive/cms/?p=2727|title=الشعر في قطر علي امتداد مائة سنة|publisher=Al Jasra Cultural and Social Club|author=Hassan Tawfiq|language=Arabic|date=1 May 2015|accessdate=29 August 2018}}</ref>

Due to the increasing number of Qataris who began receiving formal education during the 1950s and other significant societal changes, 1970 witnessed the introduction of the first [[short story]] anthology, and in 1993 the first locally authored [[novel]]s were published. Poetry, particularly the predominant [[nabati]] form, retained some importance but would soon be overshadowed by other literary types.<ref name="tawfiq"/> Unlike most other forms of art in Qatari society, females have been involved in the modern literature movement on a similar magnititude to males.<ref name="cambridge1">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pk5TA0sfERIC&pg=PA448|title=Modern Arabic Literature|authors=Muḥammad Muṣṭafá Badawī, Muhammad Mustafa Badawi, M.

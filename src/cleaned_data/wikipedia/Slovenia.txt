Historically, the current territory of Slovenia has formed part of many different states, including the [[Roman Empire]], [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Carolingian Empire]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], the [[Republic of Venice]], the French-administered [[Illyrian Provinces| Illyrian Provinces of Napoleon I]], the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. In October 1918 the Slovenes exercised self-determination for the first time by co-founding the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]]. In December 1918 they merged with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] into the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in 1929).

==Etymology==
Slovenia's name means the "Land of the [[Slavs]]" in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] and other [[South Slavic languages]]. The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.

The reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slověninъ}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' ("[[word]]"), originally denoting "people who speak (the same language)," i.&nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*němьcь}}, meaning "silent, mute people" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*němъ}} "[[muteness|mute]], mumbling"). The word ''slovo'' ("word") and the related ''slava'' ("glory, fame") and ''slukh'' ("hearing") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*ḱlew-}} ("be spoken of, glory"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|κλέος}} ({{grc-tr|κλέος}} "fame"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} ("be called"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.

The modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945–1955 |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=A Town as an Administrative–Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopač |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko društvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835}}</ref> It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialistična republika Slovenija}}).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialistične republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=Slovenian|trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopač |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1}}</ref> On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix "Socialist" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.

==== Roman era ====
[[File:Emona v Ljubljani (6).jpg|thumb|Roman [[Emona]]'s south wall (reconstruction) in present-day Ljubljana]]
The area that is present-day Slovenia was in Roman times shared between ''Venetia et Histria'' (region X of [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Roman Italia]] in the classification of [[Augustus]]) and the provinces [[Pannonia]] and [[Noricum]]. The Romans established posts at [[Emona]] (Ljubljana), [[Poetovio]] (Ptuj), and [[Celeia]] (Celje); and constructed trade and military roads that ran across Slovene territory from Italy to Pannonia. In the 5th and 6th centuries, the area was subject to invasions by the [[Huns]] and Germanic tribes during their incursions into [[Italy]]. A part of the inner state was protected with a defensive line of towers and walls called ''[[Claustra Alpium Iuliarum]]''. A [[Battle of the Frigidus|crucial battle]] between [[Theodosius I]] and [[Eugenius]] took place in the [[Vipava Valley]] in 394.

==== Slavic settlement ====
The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes migrated to the Alpine area after the westward departure of the [[Lombards]] (the last Germanic tribe) in 568, and under pressure from [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] established a [[Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps|Slavic settlement in the Eastern Alps]]. From 623 to 624 or possibly 626 onwards, [[Samo|King Samo]] united the Alpine and Western Slavs against the Avars and Germanic peoples and established what is referred to as Samo's Kingdom. After its disintegration following Samo's death in 658 or 659, the ancestors of the [[Slovenes]] located in present-day [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] formed the independent [[Carantania|duchy of Carantania]],<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y0MqAQAAMAAJ |title=Na stičišču svetov: slovenska zgodovina od prazgodovinskih kultur do konca 18. stoletja |first=Peter |last=Štih |language=Slovenian |trans-title=At the Junction of the Worlds: Slovene History from the Prehistoric Cultures to the End of the 18th Century |isbn=978-961-241-375-0 |publisher=Modrijan Publishing House |page=33|year=2009 }}</ref> and [[Carniola]], later duchy Carniola. Other parts of present-day Slovenia were again ruled by Avars before [[Charlemagne]]'s victory over them in 803.
[[File:Landhaus Wappensaal Fuerstenstein 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Prince's Stone]], symbol of the [[Carantania|Duchy of Carantania]]]]

=== Middle Ages ===
The [[Carantanians]], one of the ancestral groups of the modern Slovenes, particularly the [[Carinthian Slovenes]], were the first Slavic people to [[Christianization of the Slavs|accept Christianity]]. They were mostly Christianized by [[Irish people|Irish]] missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the "Apostle of Carantanians". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].

[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in the [[Slovene language]] until 1414.]]

In the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.

After the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.

By the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spannheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.<ref name="culture.si">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia – Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>

In the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]], the Hungarian clan [[Záh (gens)|Záh]] administering the territories connecting Slovenia with [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]] was exterminated in 1330 and the Slovenes permanently lost the connection with their [[Slovakia|Slovak]] kinsmen. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century. [[Patria del Friuli]] ruled present western Slovenia until [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] takeover in 1420.

[[File:Boj s Turki-Valvasor.jpg|thumb|The Ottoman army battling the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Habsburgs]] in present-day Slovenia during the [[Great Turkish War]].]]
At the end of the Middle Ages, the [[Slovene Lands]] suffered a serious economic and demographic setback because of the [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|Turkish raids]]. In 1515, a [[Slovenian peasant revolt of 1515|peasant revolt]] spread across nearly the whole Slovene territory. In 1572 and 1573 the [[Croatian-Slovenian peasant revolt]] wrought havoc throughout the wider region. Such uprisings, which often met with bloody defeats, continued throughout the 17th century.<ref name="culture.si"/>

=== Early modern period ===
The Republic of Venice was dissolved by France and Venetian Slovenia was passed to the Austrian Empire in 1797. The [[Slovene Lands]] were part of the French-administered [[Illyrian provinces]] established by Napoleon, the [[Austrian Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. Slovenes inhabited most of [[Carniola]], the southern part of the duchies of [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]] and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], the northern and eastern areas of the [[Austrian Littoral]], as well as [[Prekmurje]] in the [[Kingdom of Hungary (Austria-Hungary)|Kingdom of Hungary]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://journals.lib.washington.edu/index.php/ssj/article/download/3797/3208 |title=Note: The Terms Wende – Winde, Wendisch – Windisch in the Historiographic Tradition of the Slovene Lands |first=Rado |last=Lenček |author-link=Rado Lenček |year=1990 |journal=Slovene Studies |volume=12 |issue=1 |page=94}}</ref> Industrialization was accompanied by construction of railroads to link cities and markets, but the urbanization was limited.

Due to limited opportunities, between 1880 and 1910 there was extensive emigration, and around 300,000 Slovenes (i.e. 1 in 6) emigrated to other countries,<ref name="Benderly9">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXiCp49NJh8C&pg=PA10 |title=Independent Slovenia: Origins, Movements, Prospects |chapter=In the Beginning: The Slovenes from the Seventh Century to 1945 |first=Jill |last=Benderly |first2=Evan |last2=Kraft |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-312-16447-8 |pages=9–11}}</ref> mostly to the US, but also to [[South America]] (the main part to Argentina), Germany, [[Egypt]], and to larger cities in Austria-Hungary, especially [[Vienna]] and [[Graz]]. The area of the United States with the highest concentration of Slovenian immigrants is [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. The other locations in the United States where many Slovenians settled were areas with substantial industrial and mining activities: Pittsburgh, Chicago, Pueblo, Butte, northern Minnesota, and the Salt Lake Valley. The men were important as workers in the mining industry, because of some of the skills they brought from Slovenia. Despite this, the Slovene population increased significantly.<ref name="Benderly9"/> Literacy was exceptionally high, at 80–90%.<ref name="Benderly9"/>

The 19th century also saw a revival of culture in the [[Slovene language]], accompanied by a [[Romantic nationalism|Romantic nationalist]] quest for cultural and political autonomy. The idea of a [[United Slovenia]], first advanced during the [[revolutions of 1848]], became the common platform of most Slovenian parties and political movements in Austria-Hungary. During the same period, [[Yugoslavism]], an ideology stressing the unity of all [[South Slavic peoples]], spread as a reaction to [[Pan-German nationalism]] and [[Italian irredentism]].

=== World War I ===

[[File:Eingebaute Mannschaftsunterstände am Monte Sabotino.jpg|thumb|The [[Battles of the Isonzo]] took place mostly in rugged mountainous areas above the Soča River.]]
[[World War I]] brought heavy casualties to Slovenes, particularly the twelve [[Battles of the Isonzo]], which took place in present-day Slovenia's western border area with Italy. Hundreds of thousands of Slovene conscripts were drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], and over 30,000 of them died. Hundreds of thousands of Slovenes from [[Gorizia and Gradisca]] were resettled in [[refugee camps]] in Italy and Austria. While the refugees in Austria received decent treatment, the Slovene refugees in Italian camps were treated as state enemies, and several thousand died of malnutrition and diseases between 1915 and 1918.<ref>Petra Svoljšak, ''Slovenski begunci v Italiji med prvo svetovno vojno'' (Ljubljana 1991).</ref> Entire areas of the Slovene Littoral were destroyed.

Those who remained organized several connected networks of both passive and armed resistance. The best known was the [[militant anti-fascist]] organization [[TIGR]], formed in 1927 in order to fight Fascist oppression of the Slovene and Croat populations in the [[Julian March]].<ref name="Mira Cencič 1997">Mira Cencič, ''TIGR'' (Ljubljana: Mladinska knjiga, 1997)</ref><ref name="Tatjana Rejec 1995">Tatjana Rejec, ''Pričevanja o TIGR-u'' (Ljubljana: [[Slovenska matica]], 1995)</ref>

The [[Slovene People's Party (historical)|Slovene People's Party]] launched a movement for self-determination, demanding the creation of a semi-independent [[South Slavic peoples|South Slavic]] state under [[Habsburg dynasty|Habsburg]] rule. The proposal was picked up by most Slovene parties, and a mass mobilization of Slovene civil society, known as the [[May Declaration (1917)|Declaration Movement]], followed.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kranjec |first=Silvo |chapter=Korošec Anton |title=Slovenski biografski leksikon |url=http://nl.ijs.si:8080/fedora/get/sbl:1188/VIEW/ |year=1925–1991 |edition=Online |publisher=[[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] |accessdate=24 July 2010 |language=Slovenian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823082222/http://nl.ijs.si:8080/fedora/get/sbl:1188/VIEW/ |archivedate=23 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This demand was rejected by the Austrian political elites; but following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the aftermath of the [[World War I|First World War]], the [[National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] took power in [[Zagreb]] on 6 October 1918. On 29 October, independence was declared by a national gathering in Ljubljana, and by the Croatian parliament, declaring the establishment of the new [[State of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs]].

[[File:Treaty of Rapallo.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The map showing the present territory of Slovenia, with traditional regional boundaries; the Slovene-speaking areas annexed by Italy after WWI are shown in stripes]]

On 1 December 1918 the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs merged with [[Serbia]], becoming part of the new [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]]; in 1929 it was renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. The main territory of Slovenia, being the most industrialized and westernized compared to other less developed parts of Yugoslavia, became the main center of industrial production: Compared to Serbia, for example, Slovenian industrial production was four times greater; and it was 22 times greater than in [[North Macedonia]]. The interwar period brought further industrialization in Slovenia, with rapid economic growth in the 1920s, followed by a relatively successful economic adjustment to the [[1929 economic crisis]] and [[Great Depression]].

Following a [[Carinthian Plebiscite|plebiscite]] in October 1920, the Slovene-speaking southern [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] was ceded to [[Austria]]. With the [[Treaty of Trianon]], on the other hand, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was awarded the Slovene-inhabited [[Prekmurje]] region, formerly part of [[Austro-Hungary]].

Slovenes living in territories that fell under the rule of the neighboring states—Italy, Austria, and Hungary—were subjected to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].

Around 30,000 to 40,000 Slovene men were drafted to the [[Wehrmacht|German Army]] and sent to the Eastern front. The Slovene language was banned from education, and its use in public life was limited to the absolute minimum.<ref name="GJK_2013"/>

In south-central Slovenia, annexed by Fascist Italy and renamed the [[Province of Ljubljana]], the [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation|Slovenian National Liberation Front]] was organized in April 1941. Led by the Communist Party, it formed the [[Slovene Partisans|Slovene Partisan]] units as part of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] led by the Communist leader [[Josip Broz Tito]].<ref name="JJR2013_OxfordPress">[[Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones|Jeffreys-Jones, R.]] (2013): [https://books.google.com/books?id=3gK7e8LpXvcC&pg=PA87&dq=Europe%27s+most+effective+Anti+Nazi+resistance&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6eydUaOmMsbm4QTrsoCIBQ&ved=0CC4QuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=most%20effective%20Anti%20Nazi%20resistance&f=false In Spies We Trust: The Story of Western Intelligence], Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|9780199580972}}</ref><ref name="AS_2005">Adams, Simon (2005): [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cmm4J2Ug4o8C&pg=PA1981&dq=resistance+Europe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=1u2dUZT5IKam4gSZ3YCwDQ&ved=0CFMQuwUwBg#v=onepage&q=resistance%20Europe&f=false The Balkans], Black Rabbit Books, {{ISBN|9781583406038}}</ref>

After the resistance started in summer 1941, Italian violence against the Slovene civilian population escalated, as well. The Italian authorities deported some 25,000 people to the [[Italian concentration camps|concentration camps]], which equaled 7.5% of the population of their occupation zone. The most infamous ones were [[Rab concentration camp|Rab]] and [[Gonars concentration camp|Gonars]]. To counter the Communist-led insurgence, the Italians sponsored local anti-guerrilla units, formed mostly by the local conservative Catholic Slovene population that resented the revolutionary violence of the partisans. After the [[Italian armistice]] of September 1943, the Germans took over both the Province of Ljubljana and the Slovenian Littoral, incorporating them into what was known as the [[Operation Zone of Adriatic Coastal Region]]. They united the Slovene anti-Communist counter-insurgence into the [[Slovene Home Guard]] and appointed a puppet regime in the Province of Ljubljana. The anti-Nazi resistance however expanded, creating its own administrative structures as the basis for Slovene statehood within a new, federal and socialist Yugoslavia.<ref name=Tomasevich_2001>{{cite book|first=Jozo|last=Tomasevich|title=War and Revolution in Yugoslavia, 1941–1945: Occupation and Collaboration|volume=2|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2001|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-8047-3615-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqUSGevFe5MC&printsec=frontcover|ref=Tomasevich_2001|pages=96–97}}</ref><ref name="Dennison I.

In 1945, Yugoslavia was liberated by the partisan resistance and soon became a socialist federation known as the [[People's Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Slovenia joined the federation as a constituent republic, led by its own pro-Communist leadership.

Approximately 8% of the entire Slovene population died during World War II. The small Jewish community, mostly settled in the [[Prekmurje]] region, perished in 1944 in the [[Holocaust in Hungary|holocaust of Hungarian Jews]]. The German speaking minority, amounting to 2.5% of the Slovenian population prior to WWII, was either expelled or killed in the aftermath of the war. Hundreds of [[Istrian Italians]] and Slovenes that opposed communism were killed in the [[Foibe killings|foibe massacres]], and more than 25,000 fled or were expelled from [[Slovenian Istria]] in the aftermath of the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kozina.com/premik/indexeng_porocilo.htm|title=Slovene-Italian Relations 1880–1956 – Report of the Slovene-Italian historical and cultural commission|publisher=}}</ref>

=== Socialist period ===
[[File:Locator map Slovenia in Yugoslavia.svg|thumb|left|Location of Slovenia within Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]
Following the re-establishment of Yugoslavia during World War II, Slovenia became part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Federal Yugoslavia]]. A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito–Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by [[Italy]] after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.

After the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949–53, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].

[[File:Nixontito19712.jpg|thumb|right|[[Josip Broz Tito]] led [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] from 1944 to 1980; Pictured: Tito with the US president [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[White House]], 1971]]
The late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere, as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965–66, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.

Opposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.<ref name="culture.si"/> Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.

=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===
In 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''. Demands for democratisation and more Slovenian independence were sparked off. A mass democratic movement, coordinated by the [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]], pushed the Communists in the direction of democratic reforms.

In September 1989, numerous [[constitutional amendment]]s were passed to introduce [[parliamentary democracy]] to Slovenia.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.fdv.si/zalozba/pdf-ji/135.pdf |title=Razvoj parlamentarizma: funkcije sodobnih parlamentov |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Development of Parliamentarism: The Functions of Modern Parliaments |first=Drago |last=Zajc |page=109 |publisher=Publishing House of the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Ljubljana |year=2004 |isbn=961-235-170-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.svz.gov.si/si/zakonodaja_in_dokumenti/osamosvojitveni_akti_republike_slovenije/ |title=Osamosvojitveni akti Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian|publisher=Office for Legislation, Government of the Republic of Slovenia |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> <!--The same year [[Rally of Truth|Action North]] united both the opposition and democratized communist establishment in Slovenia as the first defense action against attacks by [[Slobodan Milošević]]'s supporters, leading to Slovenian independence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|title=Historical Circumstances in Which "The Rally of Truth" in Ljubljana Was Prevented|publisher=Journal of Criminal Justice and Security|accessdate=4 July 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213053210/http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329|archivedate=13 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/osamosvojitev/prispevek/108/predvajaj/|title="Rally of truth" (Miting resnice)|publisher= A documentary published by [[RTV Slovenija]]|accessdate=4 July 2012}}</ref>{{request quotation|date=July 2012}}--> On 7 March 1990, the Slovenian Assembly changed the official name of the state to the "Republic of Slovenia".<ref name="twenty.si">{{cite web|author=Innovatif and ORG.TEND |url=http://www.twenty.si/first-20-years/90/ |title=Year 1990 &#124; Slovenia 20 years |publisher=Twenty.si |date=14 May 1992 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.uradni-list.si/dl/vip_akti/1990-02-0402.pdf |title=Odlok o razglasitvi ustavnih amandmajev k ustave<!-- sic! --> Socialistične Republike Slovenije |language=Slovenian |journal=Uradni list Republike Slovenije |date=16 March 1990 |accessdate=27 December 2011}}</ref> In April 1990, the first democratic election in Slovenia took place, and the united opposition movement [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|DEMOS]] led by [[Jože Pučnik]] emerged victorious.

The term "[[Karst topography]]" refers to that of southwestern Slovenia's [[Karst Plateau]], a limestone region of underground rivers, gorges, and caves, between Ljubljana and the Mediterranean. On the Pannonian plain to the East and Northeast, toward the Croatian and Hungarian borders, the landscape is essentially flat.

=== Geology ===
[[File:Žlebiči.jpg|thumbnail|right|Solution runnels (also known as rillenkarren) are a [[:en:Karst topography|karst]] feature on the Karst Plateau, as in many other karst areas of the world.]]
Slovenia is in a rather active [[seismic zone]] because of its position on the small [[Adriatic Plate]], which is squeezed between the [[Eurasian Plate]] to the north and the [[African Plate]] to the south and rotates counter-clockwise.<ref name="Seisme">{{cite web|url=http://www.arso.gov.si/en/Seismology/|title=Seismology|accessdate=30 July 2008}}</ref> Thus the country is at the junction of three important geotectonic units: the Alps to the north, the Dinaric Alps to the south and the Pannonian Basin to the east.<ref name="Seisme"/> Scientists have been able to identify 60 destructive earthquakes in the past. Additionally, a network of seismic stations is active throughout the country.<ref name="Seisme"/> Many parts of Slovenia have a carbonate ground, and an extensive subterranean system has developed.

=== Natural regions ===
The first regionalisations of Slovenia were made by geographers [[Anton Melik]] (1935–1936) and [[Svetozar Ilešič]] (1968). The newer regionalisation by [[Ivan Gams]] divided Slovenia in the following macroregions:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://giam.zrc-sazu.si/zbornik/perko_38.pdf |first=Drago |last=Perko |title=The Regionalization of Slovenia|journal=Geografski zbornik |year=1998 |volume=38 |pages=11–57 |id={{COBISS|ID=10668077}} |issn=0373-4498 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601160317/http://giam.zrc-sazu.si/zbornik/perko_38.pdf |archivedate=1 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

* the [[Slovene Prealps|subalpine landscapes]] (''predalpski svet'')

* the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]] [[plateaus]] of the continental Slovenia (''dinarske planote celinske Slovenije'')
* [[Pannonian Plain|Subpannonian Slovenia]] (''subpanonska Slovenija'')

According to a newer natural geographic regionalisation, the country consists of four [[macroregion]]s. These are the Alpine, the Mediterranean, the Dinaric, and the [[Pannonia]]n landscapes.

Slovenia is located in temperate latitudes. The climate is also influenced by the variety of relief, and the influence of the [[Alps]] and the [[Adriatic Sea]]. In the northeast, the [[continental climate]] type with greatest difference between winter and summer temperatures prevails. In the coastal region, there is sub-[[Mediterranean climate]]. The effect of the sea on the temperature rates is visible also up the [[Soča]] valley, while a severe [[Alpine climate]] is present in the high mountain regions. There is a strong interaction between these three climatic systems across most of the country.<ref name="arso.gov.si">{{cite web|url=http://www.arso.gov.si/en/Weather/climate/Climate_of_Slovenia_at_glance.pdf |title=Climate of Slovenia at Glance |author=Tanja Cegnar |publisher=Arso.gov.si |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="arso.gov.si Meteo Archive">{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.si/met/en/app/webmet/#webmet==8Sdwx2bhR2cv0WZ0V2bvEGcw9ydlJWblR3LwVnaz9SYtVmYh9iclFGbt9SaulGdugXbsx3cs9mdl5WahxXYyNGapZXZ8tHZv1WYp5mOnMHbvZXZulWYnwCchJXYtVGdlJnOn0UQQdSf; |title=National Meteorological Service of Slovenia – Archive |publisher=Meteo.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>

Snow is quite frequent in winter and the record snow cover in Ljubljana was recorded in 1952 at {{convert|146|cm|0|abbr=on}}.

Compared to Western Europe, Slovenia is not very windy, because it lies in the slipstream of the Alps. The average wind speeds are lower than in the plains of the nearby countries. Due to the rugged terrain, local vertical winds with daily periods are present. Besides these, there are three winds of particular regional importance: the [[bora (wind)|bora]], the [[jugo]], and the [[foehn wind|foehn]]. The jugo and the bora are characteristic of the Littoral. Whereas the jugo is humid and warm, the bora is usually cold and gusty. The foehn is typical of the Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia. Generally present in Slovenia are the northeast wind, the southeast wind and the [[north wind]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.arso.gov.si/cd/klima1/Zaslon/PDF%20Zaslon/19-Znacilnosti%20vetra%20v%20Sloveniji.pdf |chapter=Značilnosti vetra v Sloveniji |language=Slovenian |trans-chapter=Characteristics of Wind in Slovenia |title=Klimatografija Slovenije |first=Renato |last=Bertalanič |year=2003 |publisher=Meteorology Office, Slovenian Environment Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209055155/http://www.arso.gov.si/cd/klima1/Zaslon/PDF%20Zaslon/19-Znacilnosti%20vetra%20v%20Sloveniji.pdf |archivedate=9 February 2006 }}</ref>

The 1992–2004 period was marked by the rule of the [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia]], which was responsible for gradual transition from the [[Titoism|Titoist]] economy to the capitalist market economy. It later attracted much criticism by neo-liberal economists, who demanded a less gradual approach. The party's president [[Janez Drnovšek]], who served as prime minister between 1992 and 2002, was one of the most influential Slovenian politicians of the 1990s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtvslo.si/slovenija/zivljenje-janeza-drnovska/79437 |title=Življenje Janeza Drnovška :: Prvi interaktivni multimedijski portal, MMC RTV Slovenija |publisher=Rtvslo.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> alongside President [[Milan Kučan]] (who served between 1990 and 2002).<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OegWny-r8TEC&pg=PA30 |title=Democratic Transition in Slovenia: Value Transformation, Education, And Media |first1=Sabrina |last1=P.

The 2005–2008 period was characterized by over-enthusiasm after joining the EU. During the first term of [[Janez Janša]]'s government, for the first time after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their [[loan-deposit ratio]]s veering out of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].

After the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Janša's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005–2008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Janša]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Janša attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that left and right parties attributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; reason behind was that each block tried to establish economic elite which will support political forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pavlovčič|first1=Idija|title=Jože P.

=== Judiciary ===
{{Main|Judiciary of Slovenia}}

Judicial powers in Slovenia are executed by [[judge]]s, who are elected by the National Assembly. Judicial power in Slovenia is implemented by courts with general responsibilities and specialised courts that deal with matters relating to specific legal areas. The [[State's Attorney|State Prosecutor]] is an independent state authority responsible for prosecuting cases brought against those suspected of committing criminal offences. The [[Constitutional Court of Slovenia|Constitutional Court]], composed of nine judges elected for nine-year terms, decides on the conformity of laws with the Constitution; all laws and regulations must also conform with the general principles of international law and with ratified international agreements.<ref name="culture.si"/>

They have participated in peace support operations and humanitarian activities. Among others, Slovenian soldiers are a part of international forces serving in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo]], and [[Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slovenskavojska.si/en/international-cooperation/ |title=International Cooperation |publisher=Slovenian Armed Forces |accessdate=15 February 2011}}</ref>

==== Municipalities ====
Officially, Slovenia is subdivided into 212 [[municipalities]] (eleven of which have the status of urban municipalities). The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''župan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''občinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]]. In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.<ref name="www2.gov.si">{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.si/zak/Zak_vel.nsf/0/660b7ab7cbd45736c125662d0037c142?OpenDocument |title=Sprejet zakon |publisher=.gov.si |date=13 July 2000 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration (''načelnik občinske uprave''), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.<ref name="www2.gov.si"/>

==== Administrative districts ====
There is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia. The 62 administrative districts, officially called "Administrative Units" (''upravne enote''), are only subdivisions of the national government administration and are named after their respective bases of government offices. They are headed by a Manager of the Unit (''načelnik upravne enote''), appointed by the Minister of Public Administration.

==== Traditional regions and identities ====
Traditional regions were based on the former [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[crown land]]s that included [[Carniola]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], and the [[Slovene Littoral|Littoral]]. Stronger than with either the Carniola as a whole, or with Slovenia as the state, Slovenes historically tend to identify themselves with the traditional regions of [[Slovene Littoral]], [[Prekmurje]], and even traditional (sub)regions, such as Upper, Lower and, to a lesser extent, Inner Carniola.<ref name="Repe_deželani_ali_državljani">Repe, Božo (2003) [http://sistory.si/?urn=SISTORY:ID:5288 Od deželana do državljana: Regionalni razvoj Slovencev v letih 1918–1991] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130223100928/http://sistory.si/?urn=SISTORY:ID:5288 |date=23 February 2013 }}, Zgodovinski časopis, 3–4, Ljubljana.</ref>

==== Statistical regions ====
The 12 ''statistical regions'' have no administrative function and are subdivided into two macroregions for the purpose of the [[Regional policy of the European Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-RA-07-020/EN/KS-RA-07-020-EN.PDF |title=Regions in the European Union: Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics |publisher=Epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu |accessdate=25 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221195504/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-RA-07-020/EN/KS-RA-07-020-EN.PDF |archive-date=21 February 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
These two macroregions are:
*[[Eastern Slovenia]] (''Vzhodna Slovenija'' – SI01), which groups the Mura, Drava, Carinthia, Savinja, Central Sava, Lower Sava, Southeast Slovenia, and Inner Carniola–Karst statistical regions.
*[[Western Slovenia]] (''Zahodna Slovenija'' – SI02), which groups the Central Slovenia, Upper Carniola, Gorizia, and Coastal–Karst statistical regions.

In 2004–2006, the economy grew on average by nearly 5% a year in Slovenia; in 2007, it expanded by almost 7%.

Slovenia offers tourists a wide variety of natural and cultural amenities. Different forms of tourism have developed. The tourist gravitational area is considerably large, however the tourist market is small.

The location at the junction of major geographic units and the area being traversed by major rivers have been the reasons for the intersection of the main transport routes in Slovenia.

A particular geographic advantage in recent times has been the location of the intersection of the [[Pan-European transport corridor]]s [[Pan-European transport corridor V|V]] (the fastest link between the North Adriatic, and Central and Eastern Europe) and [[Pan-European Corridor X|X]] (linking Central Europe with the Balkans) in the country.

[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], spoken by the respective minorities, enjoy the status of official languages in the ethnically mixed regions along the Hungarian and Italian borders, to the extent that even the passports issued in those areas are bilingual. In 2002 around 0.2% of the Slovenian population spoke Italian and around 0.4% spoke Hungarian as their native language. Hungarian is co-official with Slovene in 30 settlements in 5 municipalities (whereof 3 are officially bilingual). Italian is co-official with Slovene in 25 settlements in 4 municipalities (all of them officially bilingual).

German, which used to be the largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (around 4% of the population in 1921), is now the native language of only around 0.08% of the population, the majority of whom are more than 60 years old.<ref name="stat.si"/> [[Gottscheerish]] or ''Granish'', the traditional German dialect of [[Gottschee|Gottschee County]], faces extinction.<ref name="norwaysi">{{cite web|url= http://www.norway.si/ARKIV/heritage/granish/ |title= Granish – a Minority Language Spoken in Slovenia |publisher= Norway.si |accessdate= 2 June 2012}}</ref>

A significant number of people in Slovenia speak a variant of [[Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], or [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]) as their native language. These are mostly immigrants who moved to Slovenia from other [[former Yugoslav]] republics from the 1960s to the late 1980s, and their descendants. In 2002, 0.4% of the Slovenian population declared themselves to be native speakers of [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and 0.2% native speakers of [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]].<ref name="stat.si"/> [[Czech language|Czech]], the fourth-largest minority language in Slovenia prior to World War II (after German, Hungarian, and Serbo-Croatian), is now the native language of a few hundred residents of Slovenia.<ref name="stat.si"/>

Regarding the knowledge of foreign languages, Slovenia ranks among the top European countries. The most taught foreign languages are English, German, Italian, French and Spanish. {{As of|2007}}, 92% of the population between the age of 25 and 64 spoke at least one foreign language and around 71.8% of them spoke at least two foreign languages, which was the highest percentage in the European Union.<ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-24092009-AP/EN/3-24092009-AP-EN.PDF European Day of Languages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124065821/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-24092009-AP/EN/3-24092009-AP-EN.PDF |date=24 January 2013 }}, Eurostat Newsrelease, 24 September 2009</ref> According to the [[Eurobarometer]] survey, {{as of|2005|lc=on}} the majority of Slovenes could speak [[Croatian language|Croatian]] (61%) and English (56%).<ref name="EurobarLang">{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_386_en.pdf |title= Special Eurobarometer 386 Europeans and Their Languages |date= June 2012 |format= PDF |accessdate= 18 October 2013}}</ref>{{rp|21}}

=== Emigration ===
As to emigration, between 1880 and 1918 (World War I) many men left Slovenia to work in mining areas in other nations. The United States in particular has been a common choice for emigration, with the 1910 US Census showing that there were already "183,431 persons in the USA of Slovenian mother tongue".{{dubious|date=April 2016}} But there may have been many more, because a good number avoided anti-Slavic prejudice and "identified themselves as Austrians." Favorite localities before 1900 were Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, as well as [[Omaha, Nebraska]], [[Joliet, Illinois]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and rural areas of Iowa. After 1910, they settled in Utah (Bingham Copper Mine), Colorado (especially Pueblo), and Butte, Montana. These areas attracted first many single men (who often boarded with Slovenian families). Then after locating work and having sufficient money, the men sent back for their wives and families to join them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Pa-Sp/Slovenian-Americans.html|title=Slovenian Americans – History, Modern era, The first slovenians in america, Settlement|publisher=}}</ref>

Before World War II, 97% of the population declared itself [[Roman Catholicism in Slovenia|Catholic]] ([[Roman Rite]]), around 2.5% as Lutheran, and around 0.5% of residents identified themselves as members of other denominations.<ref name="stat.si"/>

Catholicism was an important feature of both social and political life in pre-Communist Slovenia. After 1945, the country underwent a process of gradual but steady [[secularization]]. After a decade of persecution of religions, the Communist regime adopted a policy of relative tolerance towards churches. After 1990, the Catholic Church regained some of its former influence, but Slovenia remains a largely secularized society. According to the 2002 census, 57.8% of the population is Catholic. In 1991, 71.6% were self-declared Catholics which means a drop of more than 1% annually.<ref>Source: Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, Census of Population, Households and Housing, 2002.</ref> The vast majority of Slovenian Catholics belong to the [[Latin Rite]]. A small number of [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Greek Catholics]] live in the [[White Carniola]] region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lokalno.si/si/aktualno/ljudje/?id=26004|title=Uskoška dediščina Bele krajine na RTVS&#124;Ljudje&#124;Lokalno aktualno|publisher=Lokalno.si|date=6 January 2012|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>

Despite a relatively small number of [[Protestantism|Protestants]] (less than 1% in 2002), the Protestant legacy is historically significant given that the Slovene standard language and Slovene literature were established by the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century. [[Primoz Trubar]], a theologian in the [[Lutheran]] tradition, was one of the most influential [[Protestant Reformers]] in Slovenia. Protestantism was extinguished in the [[Counter-Reformation]] implemented by the [[Habsburg dynasty]], which controlled the region. It only survived in the easternmost regions due to protection of Hungarian nobles, who often happened to be [[Calvinist]] themselves. Today, a significant [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minority lives in the easternmost region of [[Prekmurje]], where they represent around a fifth of the population and are headed by a bishop with the seat in [[Murska Sobota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evang-cerkev.si/sl/page.asp?id_informacija=35&id_language=1&id_meta_type=10|title=Predstavitev|publisher=Evang-cerkev.si|accessdate=2 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610182949/http://www.evang-cerkev.si/sl/page.asp?id_informacija=35&id_language=1&id_meta_type=10|archivedate=10 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Besides these two Christian denominations, a small [[History of the Jews in Slovenia|Jewish community]] has also been historically present. Despite the losses suffered during the [[Holocaust]], Judaism still numbers a few hundred adherents, mostly living in Ljubljana, site of the sole remaining active [[synagogue]] in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/slovenia.html|title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour – Slovenia|publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org|date=4 March 2003|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>

According to the 2002 census, [[Islam]] is the second largest religious denomination with around 2.4% of the population. Most Slovenian Muslims came from [[Bosnia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamska-skupnost.si/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1&Itemid=2 |title=Islamska Skupnost v Republiki Sloveniji |publisher=Islamska-skupnost.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> The third largest denomination, with around 2.2% of the population, is [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], with most adherents belonging to the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] while a minority belongs to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church|Macedonian]] and other Orthodox churches.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In the 2002, around 10% of Slovenes declared themselves as [[atheists]], another 10% professed no specific denomination, and around 16% decided not to answer the question about their religious affiliation. According to the [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2010,<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url= http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_341_en.pdf |title= Special Eurobarometer, biotechnology, page 204 |date=2010 |origyear= Fieldwork: Jan–Feb 2010 |format=PDF}}</ref> 32% of Slovenian citizens responded that "they believe there is a god", whereas 36% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 26% that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, god, or life force".<ref name=":0" />

=== Heritage ===
Slovenia's architectural heritage includes 2,500 churches, 1,000 castles, ruins, and manor houses, farmhouses, and special structures for drying hay, called [[hayrack]]s ({{lang|sl|kozolci}}).

Three [[historic site]]s in Slovenia are on the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] list. [[Škocjan Caves]] and its [[karst]] landscape are a protected site. The [[Heritage of Mercury. Almadén and Idrija|Idrija Mercury mining site]] is of world importance, as are the [[Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps|prehistoric pile dwellings]] in the [[Ljubljana Marshes]].

The most picturesque church{{or-inline|date=December 2018}} is the medieval and Baroque building on [[Lake Bled#Bled Island|Bled Island]]. The castle above the lake is a museum and restaurant with a view. Near [[Postojna]] there is a fortress called the [[Predjama Castle]], half hidden in a cave. Museums in Ljubljana and elsewhere feature unique items such as the [[Divje Babe Flute]] and the [[Ljubljana Marshes Wheel|oldest wheel in the world]]. Ljubljana has medieval, Baroque, Art Nouveau, and modern architecture. The architect [[Plečnik]]'s architecture and his innovative paths and bridges along the Ljubljanica are notable.

=== Cuisine ===

[[File:PrekmurskaGibanica1.JPG|thumb|[[Prekmurska gibanica]] is a typical pastry of the [[Prekmurje]] region.]]
Slovenian cuisine is a mixture of Central European cuisine (especially [[Austrian cuisine|Austrian]] and [[Hungarian cuisine|Hungarian]]), [[Mediterranean cuisine]] and [[Balkan cuisine]]. Historically, Slovenian cuisine was divided into town, farmhouse, cottage, castle, parsonage and monastic cuisines. Due to the variety of Slovenian cultural and natural landscapes, there are more than 40 distinct regional cuisines.

[[Ethnology|Ethnologically]], the most characteristic Slovene dishes were one-pot dishes, such as ''[[ričet]]'', [[Istrian stew]] ({{lang|sl|jota}}), [[minestrone]] ({{lang|sl|mineštra}}), and ''[[žganci]] ''buckwheat spoonbread; in the [[Prekmurje]] region there is also ''[[bujta repa]]'', and ''[[prekmurska gibanica]]'' pastry. Pršut [[prosciutto]] is known as ({{lang|sl|pršut}}) in the [[Slovene Littoral]]. The [[nut roll]] ({{lang|sl|potica}}) has become a symbol of Slovenia, especially among the [[American Slovenes|Slovene diaspora in the United States]]. [[Soup]]s were added to the traditional one-pot meals and various kinds of porridge and stew only in relatively recent history.

Each year since 2000, the [[Festival of Roasted Potatoes]] has been organized by the ''Society for the Recognition of Roasted Potatoes as a Distinct Dish'', attracting thousands of visitors. Roasted potatoes, which have been traditionally served in most Slovenian families only on Sundays—preceded by a meat-based soup, such as beef or chicken soup—have been depicted on a special edition of [[post mark]]s by the [[Post of Slovenia]] on 23 November 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.posta.si/opis-postnega-ziga/7855/Z-zlico-po-Sloveniji?nodeid=534 |title=WebCite query result |publisher= |accessdate=1 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CrAZ4Nqs?url=http://www.posta.si/opis-postnega-ziga/7855/Z-zlico-po-Sloveniji?nodeid=534 |archivedate=12 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The best known sausage is ''[[kranjska klobasa]]''.

Poetry in the [[Slovene language]] achieved its highest level with the [[Romantic poetry|Romantic]] poet [[France Prešeren]] (1800–1849). In the 20th century, the Slovene literary fiction went through several periods: the beginning of the century was marked by the authors of the [[Slovene Modernism]], with the most influential Slovene writer and playwright, [[Ivan Cankar]]; it was then followed by [[expressionism]] ([[Srečko Kosovel]]), avantgardism ([[Anton Podbevšek]], [[Ferdo Delak]]) and [[social realism]] ([[Ciril Kosmač]], [[Prežihov Voranc]]) before World War II, the [[poetry of resistance and revolution]] ([[Karel Destovnik Kajuh]], [[Matej Bor]]) during the war, and [[intimism (Slovene poetry)|intimism]] ([[Poems of the Four]], 1953), [[Slovenian post-war modernism|post-war modernism]] ([[Edvard Kocbek]]), and [[existentialism]] ([[Dane Zajc]]) after the war.

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of Slovenia}}
The [[Slovenian Philharmonics]], established in 1701 as part of [[Academia operosorum Labacensis]], is among the oldest such institutions in Europe. [[Music of Slovenia]] historically includes numerous musicians and composers, such as the [[Renaissance]] composer [[Jacobus Gallus]] (1550–1591), who greatly influenced Central European classical music, the Baroque composer [[Janez Krstnik Dolar]] (ca. 1620–1673), and the violin virtuoso [[Giuseppe Tartini]].

During the medieval era, secular music was as popular as church music, including wandering [[minnesinger]]s. By the time of [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, music was used to proselytize. The first Slovenian hymnal, ''[[Eni Psalmi]]'', was published in 1567. This period saw the rise of musicians like [[Jacobus Gallus]] and [[Jurij Slatkonja]].<ref>Oto Luthar ''The land between: a history of Slovenia''</ref>

In 1701, [[Johann Berthold von Höffer]] (1667–1718), a nobleman and amateur composer from Ljubljana, founded the [[Slovenian Philharmonics|Academia Philharmonicorum Labacensis]], as one of the oldest such institutions in Europe, based on Italian models.<ref>George J. Buelow (2004) ''A History of Baroque Music'', p. 701.</ref>

Composers of Slovenian [[Lieder]] and [[art song]]s include [[Emil Adamič]] (1877–1936), [[Fran Gerbič]] (1840–1917), [[Alojz Geržinič]] (1915–2008), [[Benjamin Ipavec]] (1829–1908), [[Davorin Jenko]] (1835–1914), [[Anton Lajovic]] (1878–1960), [[Kamilo Mašek]] (1831–1859), [[Josip Pavčič]] (1870–1949), [[Zorko Prelovec]] (1887–1939), and [[Lucijan Marija Škerjanc]] (1900–1973).

In the early 20th century, [[impressionism]] was spreading across Slovenia, which soon produced composers [[Marij Kogoj]] and [[Slavko Osterc]]. Avant-garde [[european classical music|classical music]] arose in Slovenia in the 1960s, largely due to the work of [[Uroš Krek]], [[Dane Skerl|Dane Škerl]], [[Primoz Ramovs|Primož Ramovš]] and [[Ivo Petric|Ivo Petrić]], who also conducted the [[Slavko Osterc Ensemble]]. [[Jakob Jez|Jakob Jež]], [[Darijan Božič]], [[Lojze Lebic|Lojze Lebič]] and [[Vinko Globokar]] have since composed enduring works, especially Globokar's ''[[L'Armonia (opera)|L'Armonia]]'', an opera.

Modern composers include [[Uros Rojko|Uroš Rojko]], [[Tomaz Svete|Tomaž Svete]], [[Brina Jez-Brezavscek|Brina Jež-Brezavšček]], [[Božidar Kantušer]] and [[Aldo Kumar]]. Kumar's ''Sonata z igro 12'' (''A sonata with a play 12''), a set of variations on a rising [[chromatic scale]], is particularly notable.

The [[Slovene National Opera and Ballet Theatre]] serves as the national opera and ballet house.

The composer of [[film score]]s for 170 films was [[Bojan Adamič]] (1912–1995).<ref name="DSS2005">{{cite book |url=http://www.dss.si/skladateljske-sledi.pdf |title=Skladateljske sledi po letu 1900|language=Slovenian, English |publisher=Society of Slovene Composers |edition=2nd |year=2005 |first=Črt |last=Sojar Voglar |isbn=961-91080-2-7 |pages=6–7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520145325/http://www.dss.si/skladateljske-sledi.pdf |archivedate=20 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

;Traditional folk music
[[Harmony|Harmony singing]] is a deep rooted tradition in Slovenia, and is at least three-part singing (four voices), while in some regions even up to eight-part singing (nine voices). Slovenian folk songs, thus, usually resounds soft and harmonious, and are very seldom in minor. Traditional Slovenian folk music is performed on Styrian harmonica (the oldest type of accordion), fiddle, clarinet, [[zither]]s, flute, and by brass bands of alpine type. In [[Prekmurje|eastern Slovenia]], fiddle and cimbalon bands are called [[velike goslarije]].

;Modern folk (Slovenian country) music
[[File:Slak lojze.jpg|thumbnail|right|Folk musician [[Lojze Slak]]]]
From 1952 on, the [[Slavko Avsenik]]'s band began to appear in broadcasts, movies, and concerts all over the [[West Germany]], inventing the original "[[Gorenjska|Oberkrainer]]" country sound that has become the primary vehicle of ethnic musical expression not only in Slovenia, but also in Germany, [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], and in the [[Benelux]], spawning hundreds of [[Alps|Alpine]] orchestras in the process. The band produced nearly 1000 original compositions, an integral part of the [[Slovenian-style polka]] legacy. Many musicians followed Avsenik's steps, including [[Lojze Slak]].

;Slovenska popevka
A similarly high standing in Slovene culture, like the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] has had in Italian culture, was attributed to the [[Slovenska popevka]], a specific genre of popular Slovene music.<ref>[http://www.delo.si/kultura/glasba/slovenska-popevka-velik-poudarek-na-pevcih-in-skladateljih-pesniki-bolj-v-oklepaju.html Slovenska popevka: velik poudarek na pevcih in skladateljih, pesniki bolj v oklepaju.

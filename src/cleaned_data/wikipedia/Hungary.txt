{{Main|Name of Hungary}}

The "H" in the name of Hungary (and Latin ''Hungaria'') is most likely due to early founded historical associations with the [[Huns]], who had settled Hungary prior to the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]. The rest of the word comes from the Latinized form of [[medieval Greek|Byzantine Greek]] ''Oungroi'' (Οὔγγροι). According to an explanation,the Greek name was borrowed from [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Bulgarian]] ''ągrinŭ'', in turn borrowed from [[Oghur languages|Oghur-Turkic]] ''[[Onogurs|Onogur]]'' ('ten [tribes of the] [[Ogur]]s'). ''Onogur'' was the collective name for the tribes who later joined the [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] tribal confederacy that ruled the eastern parts of Hungary after the Avars.<ref name="Király">{{cite book | last = Király | first = Péter | authorlink = | title = A magyarok elnevezése a korai európai forrásokban ''(The Names of the Magyars in Early European Sources)'' /In: Honfoglalás és nyelvészet ("The Occupation of Our county" and Linguistics)/ | publisher = Balassi Kiadó | date = 1997 | location = Budapest | url = http://webshop.animare.hu/honfoglalas+es+nyelveszet+83813.html | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-963-506-108-2 | page = 266}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A History of Hungary|editor=Peter F.

The [[Roman Empire]] conquered the territory west of the [[Danube]] between 35 and 9 BC. From 9 BC to the end of the 4th century, [[Pannonia]] was part of the Roman Empire, located within part of later Hungary's territory. Around AD 41–54, a 500-strong cavalry unit created the settlement of [[Aquincum]] and a Roman legion of 6,000 men was stationed here by AD 89. A civil city grew gradually in the neighbourhood of the military settlement and in AD 106 Aquincum became the focal point of the commercial life of this area and the capital city of the province of [[Pannonia Inferior]]. This area now corresponds to the [[Óbuda]] district of Budapest, with the Roman ruins now forming part of the modern Aquincum museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lovelybudapest.com/en/about-budapest/budapest-attractions/aquincum.html|title=Aquincum|website=Lovelybudapest.com|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> Later came the [[Huns]], a Central Asian tribe who built a powerful empire.

By 1006, Stephen consolidated his power, and started sweeping reforms to convert Hungary into a Western [[Feudalism|feudal state]]. The country switched to using the [[Latin language]], and until as late as 1844, Latin remained the official language of Hungary.

As a consequence, after the Mongols retreated, King Béla ordered the construction of hundreds of stone castles and fortifications, to defend against a possible second Mongol invasion.

==== Age of elected kings ====
{{Main|Ottoman–Hungarian Wars}}
[[File:Louis's kingdoms and his vassal territories.png|thumb|left|A map of lands ruled by [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]]]]

The [[Kingdom of Hungary]] reached one of its greatest extents during the Árpádian kings, yet royal power was weakened at the end of their rule in 1301. After a destructive period of [[interregnum]] (1301–1308), the first [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] king, [[Charles I of Hungary]] – a bilineal descendant of the Árpád dynasty – successfully restored royal power, and defeated oligarch rivals, the so-called "little kings". The second Angevin Hungarian king, [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] (1342–1382), led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy (Kingdom of Naples), and was also [[King of Poland]] from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilized only when [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1387–1437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Sigismund was also (in several ways) a bilineal descendant of the Árpád dynasty.

[[File:The wars of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary (1458-1490).png|thumb|Western conquests of [[Matthias Corvinus]]]]

The first Hungarian [[Bible translation]] was completed in 1439. For half a year in 1437, there was an antifeudal and anticlerical peasant revolt in [[Transylvania]], the [[Budai Nagy Antal Revolt]], which was strongly influenced by [[Hussite]] ideas.

From a small noble family in Transylvania, [[John Hunyadi]] grew to become one of the country's most powerful lords, thanks to his outstanding capabilities as a mercenary commander. He was elected governor then regent. He was a successful crusader against the Ottoman Turks, one of his greatest victories being the [[Siege of Belgrade (1456)|Siege of Belgrade]] in 1456.

The last strong king of medieval Hungary was the Renaissance king [[Matthias Corvinus]] (1458–1490), son of John Hunyadi. His election was the first time that a member of the nobility mounted to the Hungarian royal throne without dynastic background. He was a successful military leader and an enlightened patron of the arts and learning.<ref name="britannica1">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/276730/Hungary#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Hungary%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia |title=Hungary – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref> His library, the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana]], was Europe's greatest collection of historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century, and second only in size to the [[Vatican Library]].

The serfs and common people considered him a just ruler because he protected them from excessive demands from and other abuses by the magnates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/hungary/9.htm |title=Hungary&nbsp;– Renaissance And Reformation |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Under his rule, in 1479, the Hungarian army destroyed the Ottoman and Wallachian troops at the [[Battle of Breadfield]]. Abroad he defeated the Polish and German imperial armies of Frederick at Breslau ([[Wrocław]]). Matthias' mercenary standing army, the [[Black Army of Hungary]], was an unusually large army for its time, and it conquered parts of Austria, Vienna (1485) and parts of [[Bohemia]].

==== Decline of Hungary (1490–1526) ====
King Matthias died without lawful sons, and the Hungarian magnates procured the accession of the Pole [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]] (1490–1516), supposedly because of his weak influence on Hungarian aristocracy.<ref name="britannica1" /> Hungary's international role declined, its political stability shaken, and social progress was deadlocked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geography.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708070759/http://geography.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/hutoc.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=A Country Study: Hungary |publisher=Geography.about.com |accessdate=20 September 2009 }}</ref> In 1514, the weakened old King Vladislaus II faced a major peasant rebellion led by [[György Dózsa]], which was ruthlessly crushed by the [[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary|nobles]], led by [[John Zápolya]].

The resulting degradation of order paved the way for Ottoman pre-eminence. In 1521, the strongest Hungarian fortress in the South, Nándorfehérvár (today's [[Belgrade]], Serbia), [[Siege of Belgrade (1521)|fell to the Turks]]. The early appearance of Protestantism further worsened internal relations in the country.

After some [[Ottoman wars in Europe|150 years of wars]] with the Hungarians and other states, the Ottomans gained a decisive victory over the Hungarian army at the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526, where [[Louis II of Hungary|King Louis II]] died while fleeing. Amid political chaos, the divided [[Nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian nobility]] elected two kings simultaneously, [[John Zápolya]] and [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the Habsburg dynasty. With the conquest of Buda by the Turks in 1541, Hungary was divided into three parts and remained so until the end of the 17th century. The north-western part, termed as [[Royal Hungary]], was annexed by the Habsburgs who ruled as Kings of Hungary. The eastern part of the kingdom became independent as the [[Principality of Transylvania (1571–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]], under Ottoman (and later Habsburg) [[suzerainty]]. The remaining central area, including the capital Buda, was known as the [[Ottoman Hungary|Pashalik of Buda]].

Between 1703 and 1711, there was a large-scale uprising led by [[Francis II Rákóczi]], who after the dethronement of the Habsburgs in 1707 at the Diet of [[Ónod]], took power provisionally as the Ruling Prince of Hungary for the wartime period, but refused the Hungarian Crown and the title "King". The uprisings lasted for years. The Hungarian [[Kuruc]] army, although took over most of the country, lost the main [[Battle of Trencsén|battle at Trencsén]] (1708). Three years later, because of the growing desertion, defeatism and low morale, the Kuruc forces finally surrendered.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul Lendvai|title=The Hungarians: A Thousand Years of Victory in Defeat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtIr97n3tP0C&pg=PA152|year=2003|publisher=C.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and afterwards, the Hungarian Diet had not convened for decades.<ref>Peter N Stearns, The Oxford encyclopedia of the modern world, Volume 4, Oxford University Press, 2008, p. 64</ref> In the 1820s, the Emperor was forced to convene the Diet, which marked the beginning of a Reform Period (1825–1848, {{lang-hu|reformkor}}). Count [[István Széchenyi]], one of the most prominent statesmen of the country, recognized the urgent need of modernization and his message got through. The Hungarian Parliament was reconvened in 1825 to handle financial needs. A liberal party emerged and focused on providing for the peasantry. [[Lajos Kossuth]] – a famous journalist at that time – emerged as leader of the lower [[gentry]] in the Parliament. A remarkable upswing started as the nation concentrated its forces on modernization even though the Habsburg monarchs obstructed all important liberal laws relating to [[civil and political rights]] and economic reforms. Many reformers ([[Lajos Kossuth]], [[Mihály Táncsics]]) were imprisoned by the authorities.

[[File:E. Poulton Portrait of Lajos Kossuth 1860s.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Lajos Kossuth]], Regent-President during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]]]]

On 15 March 1848, mass demonstrations in Pest and Buda enabled Hungarian reformists to push through a list of [[12 points of the Hungarian Revolutionaries of 1848|12 demands]]. Under governor and president [[Lajos Kossuth]] and the first Prime Minister, [[Lajos Batthyány]], the [[House of Habsburg]] was dethroned.
The Habsburg Ruler and his advisors skillfully manipulated the Croatian, Serbian and Romanian peasantry, led by priests and officers firmly loyal to the Habsburgs, and induced them to rebel against the Hungarian government, though the Hungarians were supported by the vast majority of the Slovak, German and [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] nationalities and by all the Jews of the kingdom, as well as by a large number of Polish, Austrian and Italian volunteers.<ref>[http://www.hungarianhistory.com/lib/jeszenszky/ethnic.pdf Géza Jeszenszky: From "Eastern Switzerland" to Ethnic Cleansing], address at Duquesne History Forum, 17 November 2000, The author is former Ambassador of Hungary to the United States and was Foreign Minister in 1990{{spaced ndash}}1994.</ref> In July 1849 the Hungarian Parliament proclaimed and enacted the first laws of ethnic and [[minority rights]] in the world.<ref>Laszlo Peter, Martyn C.

Initially, the Hungarian forces (''[[Royal Hungarian Landwehr|Honvédség]]'') defeated Austrian armies. To counter the successes of the Hungarian revolutionary army, Habsburg Emperor [[Franz Joseph I]] asked for help from the "Gendarme of Europe", Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], whose Russian armies invaded Hungary. This made [[Artúr Görgey]] surrender in August 1849. The leader of the Austrian army, [[Julius Jacob von Haynau]], became governor of Hungary for a few months, and ordered the execution of [[the 13 Martyrs of Arad]], leaders of the Hungarian army, and Prime Minister Batthyány in October 1849. Lajos Kossuth escaped into exile. Following the war of 1848{{spaced ndash}}1849, the whole country was in "passive resistance".

Because of external and internal problems, reforms seemed inevitable and major military defeats of Austria forced the Habsburgs to negotiate the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], by which the dual Monarchy of [[Austria–Hungary]] was formed. This Empire had the second largest area in Europe (after the [[Russian Empire]]), and it was the third most populous (after Russia and the [[German Empire]]). The two realms were governed separately by two parliaments from two capital cities, with a common monarch and common external and military policies. Economically, the empire was a customs union. The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph I was crowned as [[King of Hungary]]. The era witnessed impressive economic development. The formerly backward Hungarian economy became relatively modern and industrialized by the turn of the 20th century, although agriculture remained dominant until 1890. In 1873, the old capital [[Buda]] and [[Óbuda]] were officially united with [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]],<ref>{{cite book|author=Kinga Frojimovics|title=Jewish Budapest: Monuments, Rites, History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-wUg6rlWS2kC&pg=PA67|year=1999|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-37-5|page=67}}</ref> thus creating the new metropolis of [[Budapest]]. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period.

After the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in Sarajevo, the Hungarian prime minister [[István Tisza]] and his cabinet tried to avoid the outbreak and escalating of a war in Europe, but their diplomatic efforts were unsuccessful. [[Austria–Hungary]] drafted 9&nbsp;million (fighting forces: 7.8&nbsp;million) soldiers in World War I (over 4&nbsp;million from the Kingdom of Hungary) on the side of Germany, Bulgaria and Turkey. The troops raised in the Kingdom of Hungary spent little time defending the actual territory of Hungary, with the exceptions of the [[Brusilov Offensive]] in June 1916, and a few months later, when the Romanian army made an attack into Transylvania,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar2.ro/arme/?language=ro&article=114|title=WorldWar2.ro – Ofensiva Armatei 2 romane in Transilvania|website=Worldwar2.ro|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> both of which were repelled. In comparison, of the total army, Hungary's loss ratio was more than any other nations of Austria-Hungary. The [[Central Powers]] conquered Serbia. Romania declared war. The Central Powers conquered Southern Romania and the Romanian capital [[Bucharest]]. In 1916 Emperor Franz Joseph died, and the new monarch [[Charles IV of Hungary|Charles IV]] sympathized with the pacifists. With great difficulty, the Central powers stopped and repelled the attacks of the Russian Empire.

The Eastern front of the Allied ([[Allies of World War I|Entente]]) Powers completely collapsed. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. On the Italian front, the Austro-Hungarian army made no progress against Italy after January 1918. Despite great Eastern successes, Germany suffered complete defeat on the more important Western front. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated (strikes in factories were organized by leftist and pacifist movements) and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. In the capital cities, the Austrian and Hungarian leftist liberal movements (the maverick parties) and their leaders supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in [[Padua]] on 3 November 1918.<ref>{{cite book|author=François Bugnion|title=The International Committee of the Red Cross and the Protection of War Victims|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6K9IAAAAYAAJ|year=2003|publisher=Macmillan Education|isbn=978-0-333-74771-1}}</ref> In October 1918, Hungary's union with Austria was dissolved.

Following the First World War, Hungary underwent a period of profound political upheaval, beginning with the [[Aster Revolution]] in 1918, which brought the social-democratic [[Mihály Károlyi]] to power as Prime Minister. Károlyi dissolved the union with Austria and disarmed the Hungarian Army, leaving the country without any national defense. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides—Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions. In March 1919, communists led by [[Béla Kun]] ousted the Károlyi government and proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] (''Tanácsköztársaság''), followed by a thorough [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]] campaign. Despite some successes on the Czechoslovak front, Kun's forces were ultimately unable to resist the Romanian invasion; by August 1919, Romanian troops occupied Budapest and ousted Kun.

[[File:Portraits de Miklós Horthy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Miklós Horthy]], Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1944)]]

In November 1919, rightist forces led by former Austro-Hungarian admiral [[Miklós Horthy]] entered Budapest; exhausted by the war and its aftermath, the populace accepted Horthy's leadership. In January 1920, parliamentary elections were held and Horthy was proclaimed Regent of the reestablished [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Kingdom of Hungary]], inaugurating the so-called "Horthy era" (''Horthy-kor''). The new government worked quickly to normalize foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] that swept through the countryside; extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and Jews lasted well into 1920. On June 4 of that year, the [[Treaty of Trianon]] established new borders for Hungary. The country lost 71% of its territory and 66% of its antebellum population, as well as many sources of raw materials and its sole [[port]], [[Rijeka|Fiume]]. Though the revision of the Treaty quickly rose to the top of the national political agenda, the Horthy government was not willing to resort to military intervention to do so.

The initial years of the Horthy regime were occupied by putsch attempts by [[Charles IV of Hungary|Charles IV]], the Austro-Hungarian [[pretender]]; continued suppression of communists; and a migration crisis triggered by the Trianon territorial changes. Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and, due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation toward [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as [[Gyula Gömbös]] and [[Ferenc Szálasi]], promising economic and social recovery, rose.

Horthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, respectively, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon. In 1939, Hungary regained further territory from Czechoslovakia [[Slovak-Hungarian War|through force]]. Hungary [[Tripartite Pact|formally joined]] the [[Axis Powers]] on 20 November 1940, and in 1941, participated in the [[German invasion of Yugoslavia|invasion of Yugoslavia]], gaining some of its former territories in the south.

Learning of the planned defection, German troops [[Operation Margarethe|occupied Hungary]] on 19 March 1944 to guarantee Horthy's compliance. In October, as the Soviet front approached and the Hungarian government made further efforts to disengage from the war, German troops ousted Horthy and installed a puppet government under Szálasi's fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]].<ref name="J. Lee Ready 1995 page 130" /> Szálasi pledged all the country's capabilities in service of the German war machine.

On 13 February 1945, Budapest surrendered; by April, German troops left the country under Soviet military occupation. 200,000 Hungarians were expelled from Czechoslovakia in exchange for 70,000 Slovaks living in Hungary. 202,000 ethnic Germans were expelled to Germany,<ref>Alfred de Zayas "A Terrible Revenge" (Palgrave/Macmillan 2006)</ref> and through the 1947 [[Paris Peace Treaties]], Hungary was again reduced to its immediate post-Trianon borders.

=== Communism 1945–1989 ===
{{Main|Hungarian Republic (1946–49)|Hungarian People's Republic|Hungarian Revolution of 1956}}

Following the defeat of Nazi Germany, Hungary became a [[Soviet satellite|satellite state]] of the Soviet Union. The Soviet leadership selected [[Mátyás Rákosi]] to front the [[Stalinization]] of the country, and Rákosi ''de facto'' ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the Rákosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|ÁVH]], to enforce the new regime. In the ensuing purges approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamupress.com/product/First-Domino,4091.aspx |title=Granville/ frm |format=PDF |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign [[Gulag]]s. Some 600,000 Hungarians were deported to Soviet labor camps, where at least 200,000 died.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8347146.stm |title=Hungary's 'forgotten' war victims |publisher=BBC News |date=7 November 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2010}}</ref>

After Stalin's death in 1953, the Soviet Union pursued a program of [[destalinization]] that was inimical to Rákosi, leading to his deposition. The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while Rákosi opposed both vigorously. Rákosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ernő Gerő]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.

The violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the ÁVH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm "Hungary's 1956 brain drain"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>

[[File:János Kádár 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[János Kádár]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956–1988)]]

After a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[János Kádár]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). Kádár quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. Kádár proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, "Those who are not against us are with us." Kádár introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''háztáji gazdálkodás''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.

In 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as "[[the happiest barrack]]" within the [[Eastern bloc]]. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's [[GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the Soviet Union itself.<ref name="madison185">*{{Cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus |title=The world economy|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-92-64-02261-4|page=185}}</ref> As a result of this relatively high standard of living, a more liberalized economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism. In the 1980s, however, living standards steeply declined again due to [[Early 1980s recession|a worldwide recession]] to which communism was unable to respond.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Watkins|first1=Theyer|title=Economic History and the Economy of Hungary|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/hungary.htm|website=sjsu.edu|publisher=San José State University Department of Economics|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref> By the time Kádár died in 1989, the Soviet Union was in steep decline and a younger generation of reformists saw liberalization as the solution to economic and social issues.

[[File:Foundation of the Visegrád Group.tiff|thumb|The [[Visegrád Group]] signing ceremony in February 1991]]

Hungary's [[fall of communism|transition from communism]] to democracy and capitalism (''rendszerváltás'', "regime change") was peaceful and prompted by economic stagnation, domestic political pressure, and changing relations with other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[József Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.

With the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1994|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1998|1998]] and [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2002|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[Hungarian European Union membership referendum, 2003|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

In 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it leaked that socialist PM [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]]'s [[Őszöd speech|had claimed in a private speech]] that his party "lied" to win the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2006|recent elections]]. The popularity of left-wing parties plummeted in the ensuing political upheaval, and in 2010, [[Viktor Orbán]]'s [[national conservatism|national-conservative]] [[Fidesz]] was [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|elected]] to a parliamentary [[supermajority]]. The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes. Although these developments were met with and still engender controversy, Fidesz secured a second parliamentary supermajority [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|in 2014]] and a third [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018|in 2018]].

In September 2018, the European parliament voted to act against Hungary, under the terms of [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union]]. Proponents of the vote claimed that the Hungarian government posed a "systematic threat" to democracy and the rule of law. The vote was carried with the support of 448 MEPs, narrowly clearing the two-thirds majority required. The vote marked the first the European parliament had triggered an article 7 procedure against an EU member state. [[Péter Szijjártó]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Hungary)|Hungarian foreign minister]], described the vote as "petty revenge" which had been provoked by Hungary's tough anti-migration policies. Szijjártó alleged that the vote was fraudulent because abstentions were not counted which made it easier to reach the two-thirds majority required to pass the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/12/eu-meps-vote-to-pursue-action-against-hungary-over-orban-crackdown|title=MEPs vote to pursue action against Hungary over Orbán crackdown|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=2018-09-12|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Hungary}}
{{See also|List of national parks of Hungary}}
[[File:Magyar racka juh.jpg|thumb|A flock of [[Racka]] sheep in the [[Fertő-Hanság National Park]]]]

Hungary's geography has traditionally been defined by its two main waterways, the [[Danube]] and [[Tisza]] rivers. The common tripartite division of the country into three sections—''Dunántúl'' ("beyond the Danube", [[Transdanubia]]), ''[[Tiszántúl]]'' ("beyond the Tisza"), and ''Duna-Tisza köze'' ("between the Danube and Tisza")—is a reflection of this. The Danube flows north-south right through the center of contemporary Hungary, and the entire country lies within its [[drainage basin]].

[[Transdanubia]], which stretches westward from the center of the country toward Austria, is a primarily hilly region with a terrain varied by low mountains. These include the very eastern stretch of the [[Alps]], ''[[Alpokalja]]'', in the west of the country, the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] in the central region of Transdanubia, and the [[Mecsek]] Mountains and [[Villány Mountains]] in the south. The highest point of the area is the Írott-kő in the Alps, at {{convert|882|m|0}}. The [[Little Hungarian Plain]] (''Kisalföld'') is found in northern Transdanubia. [[Lake Balaton]] and [[Lake Hévíz]], the largest lake in Central Europe and the largest thermal lake in the world, respectively, are in Transdanubia as well.

The ''Duna-Tisza köze'' and ''Tiszántúl'' are characterized mainly by the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] (''Alföld''), which stretches across most of the eastern and southeastern areas of the country. To the north of the Plain are the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in a wide band near the [[Slovakia]]n border. The [[Kékes]] at {{convert|1014|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} is the tallest mountain in Hungary and is found here.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Hungary belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Hungary belongs to the ecoregion of Pannonian mixed forests.

Hungary has 10 national parks, 145 minor nature reserves, and 35 landscape protection areas.

The following section is not cited, and "according to popular opinion" possibly not encyclopedic in content. Until someone looks after this, please keep it hidden:

The relative isolation of the Carpathian Basin makes it susceptible to droughts and the [[effects of global warming]] have already been felt. According to popular opinion and many scientists, the country became drier in recent decades, as droughts have become quite common. Summers became hotter and winters became milder. For these reasons, snow has become much rarer than before. Popular opinion also states that the four-season system became a two-season system as spring and autumn are getting shorter and shorter, even vanishing some years. This supposed tendency unexpectedly was reversed in 2006 when Hungary's two main rivers, the [[Danube]] and the [[Tisza]], flooded at the same time. It made hundreds of homes uninhabitable despite the hard work of the defenders who reinforced most sections of the rivers with sandbags (with the help of university students and the army of Hungary ("Honvédség")).

Most of Hungary is covered by agricultural plains; there are but few remnants of its original forests, mainly in the mountain regions and national parks. -->

Hungary is a [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[parliamentary republic|republic]]. The Hungarian political system operates under a framework reformed in 2012; this constitutional document is the [[Constitution of Hungary|Fundamental Law of Hungary]]. Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of parliament; the fundamental principles of the constitution (as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the state structure, and the [[rule of law]]) are valid in perpetuity. 199 Members of Parliament (''országgyűlési képviselő'') are elected to the highest organ of state authority, the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] ''[[National Assembly of Hungary|Országgyűlés]]'' (National Assembly), every four years in a single-round [[first-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post]] election with an [[election threshold]] of 5%.

The [[President of Hungary|President of the Republic]] (''köztársasági elnök'') serves as the [[head of state]] and is elected by the National Assembly every five years. The president is invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers: receiving foreign heads of state, formally nominating the Prime Minister at the recommendation of the National Assembly, and serving as [[Commander-in-chief]] of the [[Hungarian Army|armed forces]]. Importantly, the president is also invested with [[veto power]], and may send legislation to the 15-member [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]] for review. The third most-significant governmental position in Hungary is the [[List of Speakers of the National Assembly (Hungary)|Speaker of the National Assembly]], who is elected by the National Assembly and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body.

The [[Prime Minister of Hungary|Prime Minister]] (''miniszterelnök'') is elected by the National Assembly, serving as the [[head of government]] and exercising [[Executive (government)|executive power]]. Traditionally, the Prime Minister is the leader of the largest party in parliament. The Prime Minister selects [[Government of Hungary|Cabinet]] ministers and has the exclusive right to dismiss them, although cabinet nominees must appear before consultative open hearings before one or more parliamentary [[committee]]s, survive a vote in the National Assembly, and be formally approved by the president. The cabinet reports to [[National Assembly (Hungary)|parliament]].

The [[debt-to-GDP ratio]] of Hungary had its peak in 2011 when it stood at 83% and decreased since then. According to [[Eurostat]], the [[Government debt|government gross debt]] of Hungary amounts to 25.119 billion HUF or 74.1% of its [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://akk.hu/en|title=Central Government Gross Debt, 2016-09-30: 25 119,91 Billion HUF; Maastricht debt ratio, 2016-09-30: 74.159%|publisher=ÁKK|date=20 November 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> The government achieved a budget deficit 1.9% of the GDP in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bbj.hu/economy/ksh-hungarys-deficit-to-gdp-reaches-19-in-2015_113848|title=KSH: Hungary's deficit to GDP reaches 1.9% in 2015|publisher=BBJ|date=20 November 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> Hungary's [[credit rating]] by [[credit rating agencies]] [[Standard & Poor's]], [[Moody's]] and [[Fitch Ratings]] stands at Investment Grade ''BBB'' with a stable outlook in 2016.

The democratic character of the Hungarian parliament was reestablished with [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the end of communist dictatorship in 1989. Today's parliament is still called ''Országgyűlés'' just like in royal times, but in order to differentiate between the historical royal diet is referred to as "National Assembly" now. The [[Diet of Hungary]] was a legislative institution in the [[Kingdom of Hungary in the Middle Ages|medieval kingdom of Hungary]] from the 1290s,<ref>András Gergely, Gábor Máthé: The Hungarian state: thousand years in Europe (published in 2000)</ref><ref>Elemér Hantos: The Magna Carta Of The English And Of The Hungarian Constitution (1904)</ref> and in its successor states, [[Royal Hungary]] and the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Habsburg kingdom of Hungary]] throughout the [[Early Modern period]]. The articles of the 1790 diet set out that the diet should meet at least once every 3 years, but, since the diet was called by the [[Habsburg monarchy]], this promise was not kept on several occasions thereafter. As a result of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]], it was reconstituted in 1867.

[[File:Budapest 2015-június 13- (15).JPG|thumb|right|The original and the future seat of The Curia, the [[Supreme court|highest court]] in Hungary]]

The judicial system of Hungary is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system divided between [[court]]s with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and [[administrative court]]s with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Hungarian law is codified and based on [[Law of Germany|German law]] and in a wider sense, civil law or [[Roman law]]. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts (''járásbíróság''), regional appellate courts (''ítélőtábla''), and the supreme court (''Kúria''). Hungary's highest [[court]]s are located in [[Budapest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.birosag.hu/en/curia-hungary|title=Curia of Hungary|publisher=National Office for the Judiciary|accessdate=12 May 2014}}</ref>

Law enforcement in Hungary is split among the [[Rendőrség|police]] and Border Guards, and the National Tax and Customs Administration. The Hungarian Police is the main and largest state [[law enforcement agency]] in Hungary. It carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control. It is led by the National Police Commissioner under the control of the [[Ministry of Interior (Hungary)|Minister of the Interior]]. The body is divided into county police departments which are also divided into regional and town police departments. The National Police also have child agencies with nationwide jurisdiction, such as the police force often mocked as the Hungarian [[FBI]] "Nemzeti Nyomozó Iroda" (National Bureau of Investigation), a civilian police force specialised in investigating serious crimes, the gendarmerie-like, militarised "Készenléti Rendőrség" (Operational Police) mainly dealing with riots and often enforcing local police forces. Due to Hungary's accession to the [[Schengen Treaty]], the Police and Border Guards were merged into a single national corps, with the Border Guards becoming Police Officers. This merger took place in January 2008. The Customs and Excise Authority remained to be subject to the Ministry of Finance under the National Tax and Customs Administration.<ref>Interpol [http://www.interpol.int/Public/Region/Europe/pjsystems/Hungary.asp#21 entry]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved 15 May 2007</ref>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Hungary}}
Hungary is a [[unitary state|unitary state nation]] divided into 19 [[Counties of Hungary|counties]] (''megye''). In addition, the [[Capitals of Hungary|capital]] (''főváros''), [[Budapest]], is an independent entity. The counties and the capital are the 20 [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] third-level units of Hungary. The states are further subdivided into 174 [[Districts of Hungary|districts]] (''járás'') {{as of|2013|January|1|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kozlonyok.hu/nkonline/MKPDF/hiteles/MK14170.pdf|title=Magyar Közlöny, Hungary's Official Journal|publisher=Magyar Közlöny|date=20 November 2016 |accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> The districts are further divided into [[List of cities and towns of Hungary|towns and villages]], of which 23 are designated [[Town with county rights|towns with county rights]] (''megyei jogú város''), sometimes known as "urban counties" in English. The local authorities of these towns have extended powers, but these towns belong to the territory of the respective district instead of being independent territorial units. County and district councils and municipalities have different roles and separate responsibilities relating to local government. The role of the counties are basically administrative and focus on strategic development, while preschools, public water utilities, garbage disposal, elderly care and rescue services are administered by the municipalities.

Since 1996, the counties and City of Budapest have been grouped into 7 [[Regions of Hungary|regions]] for statistical and development purposes. These seven regions constitute [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]]' second-level units of Hungary. They are [[Central Hungary]], [[Central Transdanubia]], [[Northern Great Plain]], [[Northern Hungary]], [[Southern Transdanubia]], [[Southern Great Plain]], and [[Western Transdanubia]].

The [[Economy of Hungary|Hungarian economy]] is fairly open and relies strongly on [[international trade]].

Hungary has been a member of the [[United Nations]] since December 1955 and a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[Visegrád Group]], the [[WTO]], the [[World Bank]], the [[Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank|AIIB]] and the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]. Hungary took on the presidency of the [[Council of the European Union]] for half a year in 2011 and the next will be in 2024. In 2015, Hungary was the fifth largest [[OECD]] Non-DAC donor of [[development aid]] in the world, which represents [[List of development aid country donors|0.13% of its Gross National Income]].

Hungary's capital city, Budapest, is home to more than 100 embassies and representative bodies as an international political actor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.123embassy.com/city.php?c=Budapest|title=Embassies in Budapest|year=2014|publisher=123embassy.com|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref> Hungary hosts the main and regional headquarters of many international organizations as well, including [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]], [[European Police College]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], [[International Centre for Democratic Transition]], [[Institute of International Education]], [[International Labour Organization]], [[International Organization for Migration]], [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Red Cross]], [[Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe]], [[Danube Commission (1948)|Danube Commission]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.hu/kum2005/Templates/alapsablon.aspx?NRMODE=Published&NRORIGINALURL=%2Fkum%2Fen%2Fbal%2Fforeign_policy%2Fun_sc%2Finternational_organisations.htm&NRNODEGUID=%7B45550E06-66FE-4183-A899-EDF5BD040EB5%7D&NRCACHEHINT=NoModifyGuest&printable=true|title=International organizations in Hungary|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=20 November 2016}}</ref>

Since 1989, Hungary's top foreign policy goal has been achieving integration into Western economic and security organizations. Hungary joined the [[Partnership for Peace]] program in 1994 and has actively supported the [[IFOR]] and [[SFOR]] missions in Bosnia. Hungary since 1989 has also improved its often frosty neighborly relations by signing basic treaties with [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Ukraine]]. These renounce all outstanding territorial claims and lay the foundation for constructive relations. However, the issue of [[Hungarian diaspora|ethnic Hungarian minority]] rights in Romania, Slovakia and Serbia periodically causes bilateral tensions to flare up. Since 2017, the [[Hungary–Ukraine relations|relations with Ukraine]] rapidly deteriorated over the issue of the [[Hungarians in Ukraine|Hungarian minority in Ukraine]].<ref>"[https://www.neweurope.eu/article/hungary-ukraine-relations-hit-new-low-troop-deployment/ Hungary-Ukraine relations hit new low over troop deployment]".

In 2017, military spending will be $1.21 billion, about 0.94% of the country's GDP, well below the NATO target of 2%. In 2012, the government adopted a resolution in which it pledged to increase defence spending to 1.4% of GDP by 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hungarytoday.hu/news/budget-2017-hungary-spend-e3-7-billion-revenues-next-year-95159|title=Budget 2017: Hungary to spend €3.7 billion more than it should next year|publisher=hungarytoday.hu|accessdate=2016-04-28|date=2016-04-28}}</ref>

During WWI, out of the eight million men mobilized by [[Austro Hungarian Empire]], over one million died. During the 1930s and early 1940s, Hungary was preoccupied with regaining the territories and population lost in the [[Trianon peace treaty]] at Versailles in 1920. Conscription was introduced on a national basis in 1939. The peacetime strength of the [[Royal Hungarian Army]] grew to 80,000 men organized into seven corps commands.<ref>Page 207, Mollo, Andrew, ''The Armed Forces of World War II'', Crown, 1981, New York, {{ISBN|0-517-54478-4}}</ref> During WWII the [[Hungarian Second Army]] was near to total devastation on banks of the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] in December 1942 in the [[Battle for Stalingrad]].

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Hungary}}
[[File:Esztergom.desiro.JPG|thumb|left|[[Siemens Desiro]] on [[Hungarian State Railways]] network, which is [[List of countries by rail transport network size|one of the densest in the world]]]]
Hungary has a highly developed road, railway, air and water transport system. Budapest, the capital, serves as an important hub for the [[Hungarian State Railways|Hungarian railway system]] (''MÁV''). The capital is served by three large train stations called ''[[Eastern Railway Station (Budapest)|Keleti]]'' (Eastern), ''[[Western Railway Station (Budapest)|Nyugati]]'' (Western), and ''[[Southern Railway Station (Budapest)|Déli]]'' (Southern) ''pályaudvar''s. [[Szolnok]] is the most important railway hub outside Budapest, while [[Tiszai Railway Station]] in [[Miskolc]] and the main stations of [[Szombathely]], [[Győr]], [[Szeged]], and [[Székesfehérvár]] are also key to the network.

Budapest, [[Debrecen]], [[Miskolc]], and [[Szeged]] have tram networks. The [[Budapest Metro]] is the second-oldest underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system in the world; its [[Line 1 (Budapest Metro)|Line 1]] dates from 1896. The system consists of four lines. A [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system, ''[[HÉV]]'', operates in the Budapest metropolitan area.
Hungary has a total length of approximately {{convert|1314|km|2|abbr=on}} motorways ({{lang-hu|autópálya}}). Motorway sections are being added to the existing network, which already connects many major economically important cities to the capital.
The most important port is Budapest. Other important ones include [[Dunaújváros]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]].

There are five international airports in Hungary: [[Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport|Budapest Liszt Ferenc]] (informally called "Ferihegy" after its previous name), [[Debrecen International Airport|Debrecen]], [[Sármellék International Airport|Sármellék]] (also called Hévíz-Balaton Airport), [[Győr-Pér International Airport|Győr-Pér]], and [[Pécs-Pogány International Airport|Pécs-Pogány]]. The national carrier, [[Malév Hungarian Airlines|MALÉV]], operated flights to over 60, mostly European cities, but ceased operations in 2012. Low-budget airline [[WizzAir]] is based in Hungary, at Ferihegy.

== Demographics ==
{{Main|Demographics of Hungary|Hungarians}}

Hungary's population was 9,937,628 according to the 2011 [[census]], making it the fifth most populous country in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and [[Demographics of the European Union|medium-sized member state of the European Union]]. [[Population density]] stands at 107 inhabitants per square kilometre, which is about two times higher than the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density|world average]]. More than one quarter of the population lived in the [[Budapest metropolitan area]], 6,903,858 people (69.5%) in [[List of cities and towns of Hungary|cities and towns]] overall.<ref name="Census2011" />

Like most other European countries, Hungary is experiencing [[sub-replacement fertility]]; its estimated [[total fertility rate]] of 1.43 is well below the replacement rate of 2.1,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/hu.html|title=The World Factbook|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=30 September 2014}}</ref> albeit higher than its nadir of 1.28 in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.co.za/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&met_y=sp_dyn_tfrt_in&idim=country:HUN:POL:CZE&dl=en|title=World Development Indicators : Google Public Data Explorer|website=Google.co.za|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> As a result, its population has gradually declining and rapidly aging. In 2011, the conservative government began a program to increase the birth rate with a focus on ethnic Magyars by reinstating 3 year maternity leave as well as boosting part-time jobs.

Hungary recognizes two sizable minority groups, designated as "national minorities" because their ancestors have lived in their respective regions for centuries in Hungary: [[Germans of Hungary|German community]] of about 130,000 that lives throughout the country, and a [[Romani people in Hungary|Romani minority]] numerous around 300,000 that mainly resides in [[Northern Hungary|the northern part of the country]].

Thus, Hungarians made up more than 90% of people who declared their ethnicity.<ref name="Census2011det" /> In Hungary, people can declare more than one ethnicity, so the sum of ethnicities is higher than the total population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ksh.hu/docs/hun/xftp/idoszaki/nepsz2011/nepsz_03_00_2011.pdf|title= Hungarian census 2011 – final data and methodology |language=Hungarian|publisher=[[Hungarian Central Statistical Office]]}}</ref>

[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] is the [[official language|official]] and predominant spoken language in Hungary.

Hungarian (Magyar) is a member of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]], unrelated to any neighboring language and distantly related to [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. It is the largest of the Uralic languages in terms of the number of speakers and the only one spoken in [[Central Europe]]. There are sizable populations of Hungarian speakers in Romania, the Czech and Slovak Republics, the former Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Israel, and the U.S. Smaller groups of Hungarian speakers live in Canada, Slovenia, and Austria, but also in Australia, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Venezuela and Chile. Standard Hungarian is based on the variety spoken in the capital of [[Budapest]], although use of the standard dialect is enforced, Hungarian has a number of urban and rural [[dialect]]s.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Hungary}}
[[File:Esztergom.bazilika.lights.jpg|thumb|[[Esztergom Basilica]], the largest [[Catholic Church in Hungary]]]]
[[File:Debreceni református nagytemplom.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Reformed Great Church of Debrecen]], a symbol of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]]]

Hungary is a historically [[Christianity|Christian]] country. Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I's]] [[baptism]] and coronation with the [[Szentkorona|Holy Crown]] in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegprímás'') of Hungary. Contemporary Hungary, however, has no [[official religion]]. While the constitution "recognizes Christianity's nation-building role",<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarország Alaptörvénye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> [[freedom of religion]] is a fundamental right.

With the onset of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians took up first [[Lutheranism]], then soon afterwards [[Calvinism]]. In the second half of the 16th century, however, [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. However, in comparison to other European regions where such efforts were undertaken, it was not at all successful largely because of religious freedom secured by Hungarian nobles, who often happened to be Calvinist themselves. Some localities all over Hungary are still majority Protestant (either Lutheran or Reformed) and the country's eastern regions, especially around [[Debrecen]] (the "Calvinist Rome"), remain predominantly [[Reformed]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/ |title=Facts and Statistics |publisher=Reformatus.hu |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>

[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities:[[Armenians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]].

Historically, Hungary was home to a significant Jewish community. Some [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] were able to escape the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] during World War II, but most (perhaps 550,000<ref>Braham, Randolph L. A Magyarországi Holokauszt Földrajzi Enciklopediája [The Geographic Encyclopedia of the Holocaust in Hungary]. Budapest:Park Publishing, 3 vol. (2006).

The 2011 census showed that the majority of Hungarians were Christians (54.2%), with [[Catholic Church in Hungary|Roman Catholics]] (''Katolikusok'') (37.1%) and [[Hungarian Reformed]] [[Calvinist]]s (''Reformátusok'') (11.1%) making up the bulk of these alongside [[Lutheran]]s (''Evangélikusok'') (2.2%), [[Greek Catholic]]s (1.8%), and other Christians (1.3%). [[Jewish]] (0.1%), [[Buddhist]] (0.1%) and [[Muslim]] (0.06%) communities are in the minority. 27.2% of the population did not declare a religious affiliation while 16.7% declared themselves explicitly [[irreligious]], another 1.5% [[atheist]].<ref name="Census2011det" />

Most of the [[List of universities in Hungary|Hungarian universities]] are [[public university|public institutions]], and students traditionally study without fee payment. The general requirement for university is the [[Matura]]. The Hungarian public [[higher education]] system includes universities and other higher education institutes, that provide both education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research activities. Health insurance for students is free until the end of their studies. English and German language is important in Hungarian higher education, there are a number of degree programs that are taught in these languages, which attracts thousands of [[Student exchange program|exchange students]] every year. Hungary's higher education and training has been ranked 44 out of 148 countries in the Global competitiveness Report 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GlobalCompetitivenessReport_2013-14.pdf |title=Global Competitiveness Record 2013/2014 |accessdate=19 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604005151/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/06/12/afx3810988.html |archivedate=4 June 2011 }}</ref>

Hungary has a long tradition of higher education reflecting the existence of established [[knowledge economy]]. The established [[List of universities in Hungary|universities in Hungary]] include some of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest in the world]], the first was the [[University of Pécs]] founded in 1367 which is still functioning, although, in the year 1276, the university of [[Veszprém]] was destroyed by the troops of [[Peter I Csák|Peter Csák]], but it was never rebuilt. [[Sigismund]] established [[Óbuda University]] in 1395. Another, [[Universitas Istropolitana]], was established 1465 in [[Pozsony]] by [[Mattias Corvinus]].
[[Nagyszombat]] University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called [[Eötvös Loránd University]] today. The world's first [[institute of technology]] was founded in [[Selmecbánya]], Kingdom of Hungary in 1735, its legal successor is the [[University of Miskolc]]. The [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]] is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure, its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Joseph II]].

Hungary ranks 4th (above neighbour Romania, and after China, the United States and Russia) in the all-time medal count at the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] with 336 total medals, dating back to 1959.

Notable architectural styles in Hungary include [[Historicism]] and [[Art Nouveau]], or rather several variants of Art Nouveau. In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[Ödön Lechner]] (1845–1914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.

Turning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of "Young People" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[Károly Kós]] and Dezsö Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.

[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[Ödön Lechner]]]]

Besides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[Béla Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Aladár Árkay]] took almost the same route. [[István Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.

Foreigners have unexpectedly "discovered" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings. In the [[Budapest]] downtown area almost all the buildings are about one hundred years old, with thick walls, high ceilings, and motifs on the front wall.<ref name="Eliznik.org.uk" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://budapestcorner.com/index.php/flats/general-information|title=General information on various student flats and building types in Budapest|publisher=Budapest Corner|accessdate=11 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214123942/http://budapestcorner.com/index.php/flats/general-information|archivedate=14 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Hungary}}
[[File:Hungarian State Opera House(PDXdj).jpg|thumb|[[Hungarian State Opera House]] on [[Andrássy út]] (UNESCO World Heritage Site)]]
Hungarian music consists mainly of traditional [[Hungarian folk music]] and music by prominent composers such as [[Liszt]] and [[Bartók]], considered to be among the greatest Hungarian composers. Other renowned composers are [[Ernő Dohnányi|Dohnányi]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Zoltán Kodály]], [[Gabriel von Wayditch]], [[Rudolf Wagner-Régeny]], [[László Lajtha]], [[Franz Lehár]], [[Imre Kálmán]], [[Sándor Veress]] and [[Miklós Rózsa|Rózsa]]. Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.

Hungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music, [[György Ligeti]], [[György Kurtág]], [[Peter Eötvös|Péter Eötvös]], [[Zoltán Kodály]] and [[Zoltán Jeney]] among them. One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[Béla Bartók]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighboring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesized with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html Szabolcsi] Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style. For example, [[Béla Bartók]] and [[Zoltán Kodály]], two of Hungary's most famous composers, are known for using folk themes in their own music.</ref>
[[File:Liszt 1858.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Franz Liszt|Ferenc (Franz) Liszt]], one of the greatest pianists of all time; well-known composer and conductor]]
Hungary has made many contributions to the fields of [[folk music|folk]], [[popular music|popular]] and [[european classical music|classical music]]. Hungarian folk music is a prominent part of the national identity and continues to play a major part in Hungarian music. Hungarian folk music has been significant in former country parts that belong&nbsp;– since the 1920 [[Treaty of Trianon]]&nbsp;– to neighbouring countries such as Romania, Slovakia, Poland and especially in southern Slovakia and [[Transylvania]]; both regions have significant numbers of Hungarians.
After the establishment of a music academy led by [[Ferenc Erkel]] and [[Franz Liszt]] Hungary produced an important number of art musicians:
* Pianists: [[Ernö von Dohnányi|Ernő von Dohnányi]], [[Ervin Nyiregyházi]], [[Andor Földes]], [[Tamás Vásáry]], [[György Sándor]], [[Géza Anda]], [[Annie Fischer]], [[György Cziffra]], [[Edward Kilenyi|Edward Kilényi]], [[Balint Vazsonyi|Bálint Vázsonyi]], [[András Schiff]], [[Zoltán Kocsis]], [[Dezső Ránki]], [[Jenő Jandó]] and others.
* Violists: [[Joseph Joachim]], [[Leopold Auer]], [[Jenő Hubay]], [[Jelly d'Arányi]], [[Joseph Szigeti]], [[Sándor Végh]], [[Emil Telmanyi]], [[Zathurecky|Ede Zathurecky]], [[Zsigmondy]], [[Franz von Vecsey]], [[Zoltán Székely]], [[Tibor Varga (violinist)|Tibor Varga]] and newcomers [[Antal Szalai]], [[Vilmos Szabadi]], [[Kristóf Baráti]] (b. 79) and others.
* Opera singers: [[Astrid Varnay]], [[József Simándy]], [[Júlia Várady]], [[Julia Hamari|Júlia Hamari]], [[Kolos Kováts]] (Bluebeard in Bartók's Bluebeard)
* Conductors: [[Eugene Ormandy]], [[George Szell]], [[Antal Doráti]], [[János Ferencsik]], [[Fritz Reiner]], [[sir Georg Solti]], [[István Kertész (conductor)|István Kertész]], [[Ferenc Fricsay]], [[Zoltán Rozsnyai]], [[Sándor Végh]], [[Arpad Joo|Árpád Joó]], [[Ádám Fischer]], [[Iván Fischer]], [[Péter Eötvös]], [[Zoltán Kocsis]], [[Tamás Vásáry]], [[Gilbert Varga]] and others
* String Quartets: [[Budapest Quartet]], [[Hungarian Quartet]], [[Végh Quartet]], [[Takács Quartet]], [[Kodály Quartet]], [[Éder Quartet]], [[Festetics Quartet]],

Broughton claims that Hungary's "infectious sound has been surprisingly influential on neighboring countries (thanks perhaps to the common Austro-Hungarian history) and it's not uncommon to hear Hungarian-sounding tunes in Romania, Slovakia and Poland".<ref>Szalipszki, p. 12<br />Refers to the country as "widely considered" to be a "home of music".</ref> It is also strong in the [[Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg|Szabolcs-Szatmár]] area and in the southwest part of [[Transdanubia]], near the border with Croatia. The [[Busójárás]] carnival in [[Mohács]] is a major Hungarian folk music event, formerly featuring the long-established and well-regarded [[Bogyiszló orchestra]].<ref name="Broughton">Broughton, pp. 159–167</ref>

Hungarian [[European classical music|classical music]] has long been an "experiment, made from Hungarian antecedents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture [using the] musical world of the folk song".<ref>Szabolcsi, ''The Specific Conditions of Hungarian Musical Development''<br />"Every experiment, made from Hungarian antecedents and on Hungarian soil, to create a conscious musical culture (music written by composers, as different from folk music), had instinctively or consciously striven to develop widely and universally the musical world of the folk song. Folk poetry and folk music were deeply embedded in the collective Hungarian people's culture, and this unity did not cease to be effective even when it was given from and expression by individual creative artists, performers and poets."</ref> Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.<ref name="Szabolcsi">{{cite web|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html |title=Szabolcsi |publisher=Mek.oszk.hu |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> For example, Bartók collected folk songs from across Central and Eastern Europe, including Romania and Slovakia, while Kodály was more interested in creating a distinctively Hungarian musical style.

During the era of Communist rule in Hungary (1944–1989), a Song Committee scoured and censored popular music for traces of subversion and ideological impurity. Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of [[jazz]] such as trumpeter [[Rudolf Tomsits]], pianist-composer [[Károly Binder]] and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, [[Ferenc Sebő]] and [[Márta Sebestyén]]. The three giants of Hungarian rock, [[Illés (band)|Illés]], [[Metró (band)|Metró]] and [[Omega (band)|Omega]], remain very popular, especially Omega, which has followings in Germany and beyond as well as in Hungary. Older veteran underground bands such as [[Beatrice (band)|Beatrice]], from the 1980s, also remain popular.

[[File:Szekely Hungarian Rovas alphabet Szekely magyar rovas ABC.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|left|The alphabet of the [[Old Hungarian script|Székely-Hungarian Rovás script]]; the country switched to using the Latin alphabet under king [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]] (reign: 1000–1038)]]
In the earliest times, [[Hungarian language]] was written in a [[Old Hungarian script|runic-like script]] (although it was not used for literature purposes in the modern interpretation). The country switched to the [[Latin alphabet]] after being Christianized under the reign of [[Stephen I of Hungary]] (1000–1038).<br />
The oldest remained written record in Hungarian language is a fragment in the [[Establishing charter of the abbey of Tihany]] (1055) which contains several Hungarian terms, among them the words ''feheruuaru rea meneh hodu utu rea'', "up the military road to [[Székesfehérvár|Fehérvár]]" The rest of the document was written in Latin.<br />
[[File:Ohlm original.jpg|thumb|upright|The oldest extant Hungarian poem, [[Old Hungarian 'Lamentations of Mary'|Old Hungarian Laments of Mary]] (1190s)]]
The oldest remaining complete text in Hungarian language is the [[Funeral Sermon and Prayer]] ''(Halotti beszéd és könyörgés)'' (1192–1195), a translation of a Latin sermon.<br />
The oldest remaining poem in Hungarian is the [[Old Hungarian 'Lamentations of Mary'|Old Hungarian Laments of Mary]] ''(Ómagyar Mária-siralom)'', also a (not very strict) translation from Latin, from the 13th century. It is also the oldest surviving [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] poem.<br />
Among the first chronicles about Hungarian history were [[Gesta Hungarorum]] ("Deeds of the Hungarians") by the unknown author usually called ''Anonymus'', and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]] ("Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians") by Simon Kézai. Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''Képes krónika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].
[[File:Képes Krónika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]
[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458–1490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[András Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].
The most important poets of the period was [[Bálint Balassi]] (1554–1594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Miklós Zrínyi]] (1620–1664).

Balassi's poetry shows Mediaeval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zrínyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' ("Peril of Sziget", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetvár]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetvár.
Among the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[Gáspár Károli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[Gönc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published. (See [[Bible translations into Hungarian]] for more details.)
[[File:Marai2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sándor Márai]], Hungarian writer and journalist]]

The Hungarian enlightenment took place about fifty years after the French [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]. The first enlightened writers were [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria (1717–1780)|Maria Theresia]]'s bodyguards ([[György Bessenyei]], [[János Batsányi]] and others). The greatest poets of the time were [[Mihály Csokonai Vitéz]] and [[Dániel Berzsenyi]].
The greatest figure of the language reform was [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]. The [[Hungarian language]] became feasible for all type of scientific explanations from this time, and furthermore many new words were coined for describing new inventions.

[[Hungarian literature]] has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Hungary (mostly through translations into German, French and English). Some modern Hungarian authors have become increasingly popular in Germany and Italy especially [[Sándor Márai]], [[Péter Esterházy]], [[Péter Nádas]] and [[Imre Kertész]]. The latter is a contemporary Jewish writer who survived the Holocaust and won the Nobel Prize for literature in 2002.
The older classics of Hungarian literature and Hungarian poetry have remained almost totally unknown outside Hungary. [[János Arany]], a famous 19th-century Hungarian poet, is still much loved in Hungary (especially his collection of [[Ballads]]), among several other "true classics" like [[Sándor Petőfi]], the poet of the Revolution of 1848, [[Endre Ady]], [[Mihály Babits]], [[Dezső Kosztolányi]], [[Attila József]], [[Miklós Radnóti]] and [[János Pilinszky]]. Other well-known Hungarian authors are [[László Krasznahorkai]], [[Ferenc Móra]], [[Géza Gárdonyi]], [[Zsigmond Móricz]], [[Gyula Illyés]], [[Albert Wass]], [[Miklós Szentkuthy]], [[Magda Szabó]] and [[Stephen Vizinczey]].

Traditional dishes such as the world-famous [[Goulash]] (''gulyás'' stew or ''gulyás'' soup) feature prominently in Hungarian cuisine. Dishes are often flavoured with [[paprika]] (ground red peppers), a Hungarian innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sulinet.hu/tart/fcikk/Kjc/0/23144/1 |title=Sulinet: Magyar növény-e a paprika? |publisher=Sulinet.hu |accessdate=21 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620004145/http://www.sulinet.hu/tart/fcikk/Kjc/0/23144/1 |archivedate=20 June 2008 }}</ref> The paprika powder, obtained from a special type of pepper, is one of the most common spices used in typical Hungarian cuisine. Thick, heavy Hungarian sour cream called ''[[tejföl]]'' is often used to soften the dishes' flavour.

[[File:Tokaji 6p 1989.jpg|thumb|upright|The famous [[Tokaji]] wine. It was called "Vinum Regum, Rex Vinorum" ("Wine of Kings, King of Wines") by [[Louis XIV of France]]]]

Wine: As [[Hugh Johnson (wine)|Hugh Johnson]] says in ''The History of Wine'', the territory of Hungary is ideal for wine-making.{{fact|date=February 2019}} Since the fall of communism there has been a renaissance in Hungarian wine-making. The choice of quality wine is widening from year to year. The country can be divided to six wine regions: [[North-Transdanubia]], [[Lake Balaton]], [[South-Pannónia]], [[Duna-region]] or Alföld, [[Upper-Hungary]] and [[Tokaj-Hegyalja]].

Hungarian wine regions offer a great variety of styles: the main products of the country are elegant and full-bodied dry whites with good acidity, although complex sweet whites (Tokaj), elegant ([[Eger]]) and full-bodied robust reds ([[Villány]] and [[Szekszárd]]). The main varieties are: [[Olaszrizling]], [[Hárslevelű]], [[Furmint]], [[Pinot gris]] or Szürkebarát, [[Chardonnay]] (whites), [[Kékfrankos]] (or Blaufrankisch in German), [[Kadarka]], [[Portugieser]], [[Zweigelt]], [[Cabernet sauvignon]], [[Cabernet franc]] and [[Merlot]]. The most famous wines from Hungary are [[Tokaji Aszú]] and [[Egri Bikavér]].<ref>This is the world-famous sweet, topaz-colored wine known throughout the English-speaking world as '''Tokay'''. "A rich, sweet, moderately strong wine of a topaz color, produced in the vicinity of Tokay, in Hungary; also, a similar wine produced elsewhere."

Napoleon III, the last Emperor of France, ordered 30–40 barrels of Tokaji at the French Royal Court every year. Gustav III, King of Sweden, loved Tokaji.<ref name="royal tokaji" /> In Russia, customers included Peter the Great and Empress Elizabeth, while Catherine the Great actually established a Russian garrison in the town of Tokaj with the aim of assuring regular wine deliveries to St. Petersburg.<ref name="royal tokaji" />

For over 150 years, a blend of 40 Hungarian herbs has been used to create the liqueur [[Unicum]].

=== Recreation ===
[[File:Hévíz.jpg|thumb|[[Lake Hévíz]], the largest thermal lake in Europe]]
Hungary is a land of [[thermal]] water. A passion for spa culture and [[Hungarian history]] have been connected from the very beginning. Hungarian spas feature [[ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Greek architecture|Greek]], [[Architecture of Turkey|Turkish]], and northern country architectural elements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitspas.eu/hungary/ |title=Hungary (Magyarország) – spa resorts & hotels |publisher=Visitspas.eu |date= |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>

Because of an advantageous geographical location, good quality thermal water can be found in great quantities on over 80% of Hungary's territory. Approximately 1,500 thermal springs can be found in Hungary (more than 100 just in the Capital area). There are approximately 450 public baths in Hungary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umvp.eu/english/about-hungary.html|title=New Hungary Rural Development Programme|website=Umvp.eu|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref>

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] heralded the first age of spas in Hungary. The remains of their bath complexes are still to be seen in [[Óbuda]]. Spa culture was revived during the [[Turkish Invasion]] and the thermal springs of [[Buda]] were used for the construction of a number of bathhouses, some of which such as ([[Király Baths]], [[Rudas Baths]]) are still functioning.

In the 19th century, the advancement in deep drilling and medical science provided the springboard for a further leap in bathing culture. Grand spas such as [[Gellért Baths]], Lukács Baths, [[Margaret Island]], and [[Széchenyi Medicinal Bath]] are a reflection of this resurgence in popularity. The Széchenyi Thermal Bath is the largest spa complex in Europe and it was the first thermal bath built in the Pest side of Budapest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticket.info.hu/en/program/baths-of-budapest/szechenyi-bath|title=Széchenyi Bath|publisher=Hungária Koncert Kft.|accessdate=2015-07-13|location=Budapest}}</ref> This building is a noted example of modern Renaissance Style.

=== Folk art ===
[[File:Voivodina Hungarians national costume and dance 6.jpg|thumb|left|Hungarians dancing [[csárdás]] in traditional garments / folk costumes]]

[[Ugrós]] (Jumping dances): Old style dances dating back to the [[Middle Ages]].
Solo or couple dances accompanied by old style music, shepherd and other solo man's dances from [[Transylvania]], and marching dances along with remnants of medieval weapon dances belong in this group.

[[Karikázó]]: a circle dance performed by women only accompanied by singing of folksongs.

[[Csárdás]]: New style dances developed in the 18–19th centuries is the Hungarian name for the national dances, with Hungarian embroidered costumes and energetic music. From the men's intricate bootslapping dances to the ancient women's circle dances, Csárdás demonstrates the infectious exuberance of the Hungarian folk dancing still celebrated in the villages.

[[Verbunkos]]: a solo man's dance evolved from the recruiting performances of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army.

The [[Legényes]] is a men's solo dance done by the ethnic Hungarian people living in the [[Kalotaszeg]] region of Transylvania. Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).

It was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.

Nearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.

The finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;– red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.

In Hungary proper, Sárköz in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mezőkövesd|Matyóföld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|Sárköz]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.

These vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.

=== Porcelain ===
{{Main|Herend Porcelain|Zsolnay}}
Founded in 1826, [[Herend Porcelain]] is one of the world's largest ceramic factories, specializing in luxury hand painted and gilded [[porcelain]]. In the mid-19th century it was purveyor to the [[Habsburg Dynasty]] and aristocratic customers throughout Europe. Many of its classic patterns are still in production. After the fall of communism in Hungary, the factory was privatised and is now 75% owned by its management and workers, exporting to over 60 countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herend.com/ |title=Herend Porcelain Manufactory Ltd |publisher=Herend.com |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>

Zsolnay Porcelain Manufacture is a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain, pottery, ceramics, tiles and stoneware. The company introduced the eosin glazing process and pyrogranite ceramics.
The Zsolnay factory was established by Miklós Zsolnay in [[Pécs]], Hungary, to produce stoneware and ceramics in 1853. In 1863, his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828–1900) joined the company and became its manager and director after several years. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a Grand Prix.

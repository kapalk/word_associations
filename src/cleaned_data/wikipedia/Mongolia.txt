'''Mongolia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Mongolia.ogg|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|l|i|ə}}; {{lang|mn-Cyrl|{{linktext|Монгол}} {{linktext|Улс}}}} {{lang|mn-Latn|Mongol Uls}} 
in [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet|Mongolian Cyrillic]]; {{lang|mn-Latn|Mongγol Ulus}} [transliterated] in [[Mongolian script]]) is a [[landlocked country]] in [[East Asia]]. Its area is roughly equivalent with the historical territory of [[Outer Mongolia]], and that term is sometimes used to refer to the current state. It is sandwiched between [[China]] to the south and [[Russia]] to the north. Mongolia does not share a border with [[Kazakhstan]], although only {{convert|37|km}} separates them.

At {{convert|1564116|km2}}, Mongolia is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|18th-largest]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|most sparsely populated]] [[sovereign state]]  in the world, with a population of around 3 million people. It is also the world's second-largest landlocked country behind [[Kazakhstan]] and the largest landlocked country that does not border a [[Endorheic basin|closed sea]]. The country contains very little [[arable land]], as much of its area is covered by grassy [[steppe]], with mountains to the north and west and the [[Gobi Desert]] to the south. [[Ulaanbaatar]], the capital and largest city, is home to about 45% of the country's population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mongolia Population 2018 |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mongolia-population/ |website=worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref> Ulaanbaatar also shares the rank of the world's coldest capital city with [[Moscow]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Nur-Sultan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/coldest-capital-now-ottawa-1.4466107|title=Iced cap: Ottawa currently coldest capital city in the world {{!}} CBC News|last=Dec 28|first=CBC News · Posted:|last2=December 28|first2=2017 10:24 AM ET {{!}} Last Updated:|website=CBC|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18|last3=2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-coldest-capital-cities-in-the-world.html|title=The Coldest Capital Cities In The World|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/coldest-capital-cities-1435314|title=What Is the Coldest Capital City in the World?|last=geography|first=Matt Rosenberg Matt Rosenberg has a masters in|last2=Writer|first2=Is an Award-Winning Freelance|website=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-12-18|last3=Subject|first3=Author of Two Books on the}}</ref>

Approximately 30% of the population is [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic; [[Horse culture in Mongolia|horse culture]] is still integral. The majority of its population are [[Buddhism|Buddhists]]. The non-religious population is the second largest group. [[Islam]] is the dominant religion among ethnic [[Kazakhs]]. The majority of the state's citizens are of Mongol ethnicity, although [[Kazakhs]], [[Tuvans]], and other minorities also live in the country, especially in the west. Mongolia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade groups.<ref name="cia"/>

The area of what is now Mongolia has been ruled by various [[nomadic empire]]s, including the [[Xiongnu]], the [[Xianbei]], the [[Rouran]], the [[Turkic Khaganate]], and others. In 1206, [[Genghis Khan]] founded the [[Mongol Empire]], which became the largest [[List of largest empires|contiguous land empire]] in history. His grandson [[Kublai Khan]] conquered China to establish the [[Yuan dynasty]]. After the collapse of the Yuan, the [[Mongols]] retreated to Mongolia and resumed their earlier pattern of factional conflict, except during the era of [[Dayan Khan]] and [[Tumen Zasagt Khan]].

In the 16th century, [[Buddhism in Mongolia|Tibetan Buddhism]] began to spread in Mongolia, being further led by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-founded [[Qing dynasty]], which absorbed the country in the 17th century. By the early 1900s, almost one-third of the adult male population were Buddhist monks.<ref>Michael Jerryson, ''Mongolian Buddhism: The Rise and Fall of the Sangha,'' (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Books, 2007), 89.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Mongolia – Religion |url = http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/east_asia/mongolia/religion.htm |website = Michigan State University |accessdate = January 24, 2015 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150315082839/http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/east_asia/mongolia/religion.htm |archivedate = March 15, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> After the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Mongolia [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911|declared independence]], and achieved actual [[Mongolian Revolution of 1921|independence from the Republic of China]] in 1921.

Neolithic agricultural settlements (c. 5500–3500 BC), such as those at Norovlin, Tamsagbulag, Bayanzag, and Rashaan Khad, predated the introduction of horse-riding nomadism, a pivotal event in the history of Mongolia which became the dominant culture. Horse-riding nomadism has been documented by archeological evidence in Mongolia during the Copper and Bronze Age [[Afanasevo culture]] (3500–2500 BC); this culture was active to the [[Khangai Mountains]] in Central Mongolia. The wheeled vehicles found in the burials of the Afanasevans have been dated to before 2200 BC.<ref>{{cite book|author=David Christian|title=A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia|date=December 16, 1998|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-631-20814-3|page=101}}</ref> Pastoral nomadism and metalworking became more developed with the later [[Okunev culture]] (2nd millennium BC), [[Andronovo culture]] (2300–1000 BC) and [[Karasuk culture]] (1500–300 BC), culminating with the Iron Age [[Xiongnu]] Empire in 209 BC. Monuments of the pre-Xiongnu Bronze Age include [[deer stone]]s, keregsur [[kurgans]], [[Slab Grave Culture|square slab tombs]], and rock paintings.

Although cultivation of crops has continued since the Neolithic, agriculture has always remained small in scale compared to pastoral nomadism. Agriculture may have first been introduced from the west or arose independently in the region. The population during the [[Copper Age]] has been described as mongoloid in the east of what is now Mongolia, and as europoid in the west.<ref name="Novgorodova"/> Tocharians ([[Yuezhi]]) and [[Scythians]] inhabited western Mongolia during the Bronze Age.

The intrusions of northern pastoralists (e.g. the Guifang, Shanrong, and [[Donghu people|Donghu]]) into China during the [[Shang dynasty]] (1600–1046 BC) and [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BC) presaged the age of [[nomadic empire]]s.

The concept of Mongolia as an independent power north of China is expressed in a letter sent by [[Emperor Wen of Han]] to [[Laoshang Chanyu]] in 162 BC (recorded in the ''[[Hanshu]]''):
{{cquote| The Emperor of China respectfully salutes the great Shan Yu (Chanyu) of the [[Xiongnu|Hsiung-nu]] (Xiongnu)...When my imperial predecessor erected the Great Wall, all the bowmen nations on the north were subject to the Shan Yu; while the residents inside the wall, who wore the cap and sash, were all under our government: and the myriads of the people, by following their occupations, ploughing and weaving, shooting and hunting, were able to provide themselves with food and clothing...Your letter says:--"The two nations being now at peace, and the two princes living in harmony, military operations may cease, the troops may send their horses to graze, and prosperity and happiness prevail from age to age, commencing, a new era of contentment and peace." That is extremely gratifying to me...Should I, in concert with the Shan Yu, follow this course, complying with the will of heaven, then compassion for the people will be transmitted from age to age, and extended to unending generations, while the universe will be moved with admiration, and the influence will be felt by neighbouring kingdoms inimical to the Chinese or the Hsiung-nu...As the Hsiung-nu live in the northern regions, where the cold piercing atmosphere comes at an early period, I have ordered the proper authorities to transmit yearly to the Shan Yu, a certain amount of grain, gold, silks of the finer and coarser kinds, and other objects. Now peace prevails all over the world; the myriads of the population are living in harmony, and I and the Shan Yu alone are the parents of the people...After the conclusion of the treaty of peace throughout the world, take notice, the Han will not be the first to transgress.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hantxt1.html | title=Selections from the Han Narrative Histories | publisher=Silk Road Texts, Washington University at Saint Louis | accessdate=March 30, 2014 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011015526/http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/hantxt1.html | archivedate=October 11, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

Since prehistoric times, Mongolia has been inhabited by nomads who, from time to time, formed great confederations that rose to power and prominence. Common institutions were the office of the [[Khan (title)|Khan]], the [[Kurultai]] (Supreme Council), left and right wings, imperial army ([[Keshig]]) and the decimal military system. The first of these empires, the [[Xiongnu]] of undetermined ethnicity, were brought together by [[Modu Shanyu]] to form a confederation in 209 BC. Soon they emerged as the greatest threat to the [[Qin Dynasty]], forcing the latter to construct the [[Great Wall of China]]. It was guarded by up to almost 300,000 soldiers during Marshal [[Meng Tian]]'s tenure, as a means of defense against the destructive Xiongnu raids. The vast Xiongnu empire (209 BC–93 AD) was followed by the Mongolic [[Xianbei state|Xianbei empire]] (93–234 AD), which also ruled more than the entirety of present-day Mongolia. The Mongolic [[Rouran]] Khaganate (330–555), of [[Xianbei]] provenance was the first to use "Khagan" as an imperial title. It ruled a massive empire before being defeated by the [[Göktürks]] (555–745) whose empire was even bigger.

The Göktürks laid siege to [[Panticapaeum]], present-day [[Kerch]], in 576. They were succeeded by the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] (745–840) who were defeated by the Kyrgyz. The Mongolic [[Khitan people|Khitans]], descendants of the Xianbei, ruled Mongolia during the [[Liao Dynasty]] (907–1125), after which the [[Khamag Mongol]] (1125–1206) rose to prominence.

Lines 3–5 of the memorial inscription of [[Bilge Khagan]] (684–737) in central Mongolia summarizes the time of the [[Khagan]]s:

{{cquote| In battles they subdued the nations of all four sides of the world and suppressed them. They made those who had heads bow their heads, and who had knees genuflect them. In the east up to the Kadyrkhan common people, in the west up to the Iron Gate they conquered... These Khagans were wise. These Khagans were great. Their servants were wise and great too. Officials were honest and direct with people. They ruled the nation this way. This way they held sway over them. When they died ambassadors from Bokuli Cholug (Baekje Korea), Tabgach (Tang China), Tibet (Tibetan Empire), [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] (Avar Khaganate), Rome (Byzantine Empire), [[Yenisei Kirghiz|Kirgiz]], Uch-Kurykan, Otuz-Tatars, [[Khitan people|Khitans]], [[Kumo Xi|Tatabis]] came to the funerals. So many people came to mourn over the great Khagans. They were famous Khagans.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bitig.org/?lang=e&mod=1&tid=1&oid=16&m=1 | title=Memorial Complex of Bilge Khagan | publisher=bitig.org | accessdate=January 1, 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203230249/http://www.bitig.org/?lang=e | archivedate=February 3, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

In the chaos of the late 12th century, a chieftain named [[Genghis Khan|Temüjin]] finally succeeded in uniting the Mongol tribes between [[Manchuria]] and the [[Altai Mountains]]. In 1206, he took the title [[Genghis Khan#Name and title|Genghis Khan]], and waged a series of military campaigns – renowned for their brutality and ferocity – sweeping through much of Asia, and forming the [[Mongol Empire]], the largest contiguous land empire in world history.

After Genghis Khan's death, the empire was subdivided into four kingdoms or [[Khanate]]s. These eventually became quasi-independent after the [[Toluid Civil War]] (1260–1264), which broke out in a battle for power following [[Möngke Khan]]'s death in 1259. One of the khanates, the "Great Khaanate", consisting of the Mongol homeland and [[History of China|China]], became known as the [[Yuan dynasty]] under [[Kublai Khan]], the grandson of Genghis Khan. He set up his capital in present-day [[Beijing]]. After more than a century of power, the Yuan was replaced by the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368, and the Mongol court fled to the north. As the Ming armies pursued the Mongols into their homeland, they successfully sacked and destroyed the Mongol capital [[Karakorum]] and other cities. Some of these attacks were repelled by the Mongols under [[Biligtü Khan Ayushiridara|Ayushridar]] and his general [[Köke Temür]].<ref>{{cite book |title=《扩廓帖木儿传》[biography of  Köke Temür]|publisher=[[History of Yuan]]|edition=卷一四一，列传第二八}}</ref>

After the expulsion of the Yuan dynasty rulers from China, the Mongols continued to rule their homeland, known as the [[Northern Yuan dynasty]]. The next centuries were marked by violent power struggles among various factions, notably the Genghisids and the non-Genghisid [[Oirats]], as well as by several Chinese invasions (such as the [[Yongle Emperor's campaigns against the Mongols|five expeditions led by the Yongle Emperor]]). In the early 15th century, the Oirads under [[Esen Tayisi]] gained the upper hand, and raided China in 1449 in a [[Tumu Crisis|conflict]] over Esen's right to pay tribute, capturing the Ming [[Zhengtong Emperor|emperor]] in the process. When Esen was murdered in 1454, the [[Borjigid]]s regained power. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In the early 16th century, [[Dayan Khan]] and his [[khatun]] [[Mandukhai]] reunited the entire Mongol nation under the Genghisids. In the mid-16th century, [[Altan Khan]] of the Tümed, a grandson of [[Dayan Khan]] – but not a hereditary or legitimate Khan – became powerful. He founded [[Hohhot]] in 1557. After he met with the [[Dalai Lama]] in 1578, he ordered the introduction of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] to Mongolia. (It was the second time this had occurred). Abtai Khan of the [[Khalkha]] converted to Buddhism and founded the [[Erdene Zuu]] monastery in 1585. His grandson [[Zanabazar]] became the first [[Jebtsundamba Khutughtu]] in 1640. Following the leaders, the entire Mongolian population embraced Buddhism. Each family kept scriptures and Buddha statues on an altar at the north side of their [[yurt|ger]] (yurt). Mongolian nobles donated land, money and herders to the monasteries. As was typical in states with established religions, the top religious institutions, the monasteries, wielded significant temporal power in addition to spiritual power. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

The last Mongol Khan was [[Ligden Khan]] in the early 17th century. He came into conflicts with the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] over the looting of Chinese cities, and also alienated most Mongol tribes.<!--Why? --> He died in 1634. By 1636 most [[Inner Mongolia]]n tribes had submitted to the Manchus, who founded the [[Qing dynasty]]. The Khalkha eventually submitted to Qing rule in 1691, thus bringing all of today's Mongolia under Manchu rule. After several wars, the [[Dzungars]] (the western Mongols or Oirats) were virtually annihilated during the Qing conquest of Dzungaria in 1757–58.<ref>{{cite web |author=Edward Allworth |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/313790/Kazakhstan/214566/History#ref=ref598970 |title=Kazakhstan to c. 1700 ce |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212010855/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/313790/Kazakhstan/214566/History#ref=ref598970 |archivedate=December 12, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]] of Mongolia had immense ''de facto'' authority. The Manchu forbade mass Chinese immigration into the area, which allowed the Mongols to keep their culture. The Oirats who migrated to the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe|Volga steppes]] in Russia became known as [[Kalmyks]].

The main trade route during this period was the [[Siberian Route|Tea Road]] through Siberia; it had permanent stations located every {{convert|25|to|30|km|mi}}, each of which was staffed by 5–30 chosen families. Urga (present-day [[Ulaanbaatar]]) benefited greatly from this overland trade, as it was the only {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} major settlement in Outer Mongolia used as a stopover point by merchants, officials and travelers on the [[Kyakhta trade|Tea Road]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Until 1911, the Qing dynasty maintained control of Mongolia with a series of alliances and intermarriages, as well as military and economic measures. [[Amban]]s, Manchu "high officials", were installed in [[Ulaanbaatar|Khüree]], [[Uliastai]], and [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]], and the country was divided into numerous feudal and ecclesiastical fiefdoms (which also placed people in power with loyalty to the Qing). Over the course of the 19th century, the feudal lords attached more importance to representation and less importance to the responsibilities towards their subjects. The behaviour of Mongolia's nobility, together with [[usury|usurious]] practices by Chinese traders and the collection of imperial taxes in silver instead of animals, resulted in widespread poverty among the nomads. By 1911 there were 700 large and small monasteries in Outer Mongolia; their 115,000 monks made up 21% of the population. Apart from the Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, there were 13 other reincarnating high lamas, called 'seal-holding saints' (''tamgatai khutuktu''), in Outer Mongolia.

[[File:BogdKhan.jpg|thumb|upright|The eighth [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]], Bogd Khaan]]
With the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Mongolia under the [[Bogd Khaan]] declared independence.  But the newly established [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] considered Mongolia to be part of its own territory. [[Yuan Shikai]], the [[President of the Republic of China]], considered the new republic to be the [[Successor state|successor]] of the Qing.  Bogd Khaan said that [[Qing dynasty in Inner Asia|both Mongolia and China]] had been administered by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] during the Qing, and after the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, the contract of Mongolian submission to the Manchu had become invalid.<ref>Bawden, Charles (1968): ''The Modern History of Mongolia.'' Weidenfeld & Nicolson: 194–195</ref>{{Efn|This view is further explored in the school of thought of [[New Qing History]].}}

The area controlled by the Bogd Khaan was approximately that of the former [[Outer Mongolia]] during the Qing period. In 1919, after the [[October Revolution]] in Russia, Chinese troops led by [[Warlord Era|warlord]] [[Xu Shuzheng]] occupied Mongolia. Warfare erupted on the northern border. As a result of the [[Russian Civil War]], the [[White movement|White]] Russian [[Lieutenant General]] [[Roman Ungern von Sternberg|Baron Ungern]] led his troops into Mongolia in October 1920, defeating the Chinese forces in [[Ulaanbaatar|Niislel Khüree]] (now Ulaanbaatar) in early February 1921 with Mongol support.

To eliminate the threat posed by Ungern, [[Russian SFSR|Bolshevik Russia]] decided to support the establishment of a communist Mongolian government and army. This Mongolian army took the [[Altanbulag, Selenge|Mongolian part]] of [[Kyakhta]] from Chinese forces on March 18, 1921, and on July 6 Russian and Mongolian troops arrived in Khüree. Mongolia declared its independence again on July 11, 1921.<ref>Thomas E. Ewing, "Russia, China, and the Origins of the Mongolian People's Republic, 1911–1921: A Reappraisal", in: ''The Slavonic and East European Review'', Vol. 58, No. 3 (Jul. 1980), pp. 399, 414, 415, 417, 421</ref> As a result, Mongolia was closely aligned with the Soviet Union over the next seven decades.

The early leaders of the Mongolian People's Republic (1921–1952) were not communists and many of them were [[Pan-Mongolism|Pan-Mongolists]]. The [[Soviet Union]] forcefully established a [[communist state|communist regime]] in Mongolia by later exterminating Pan-Mongolists. In the 1960s, Soviets recognized the [[Mongolian People's Party]] as "real" communists, who took power after the suspicious death of Pan-Mongolist leader Choibalsan.

Khorloogiin Choibalsan instituted [[collectivisation]] of livestock, began the destruction of the [[Tibetan Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[monastery|monasteries]], and carried out the [[Stalinist repressions in Mongolia]], which resulted in the murders of numerous monks and other leaders. In Mongolia during the 1920s, approximately one-third of the male population were monks.

==== Cold War ====
The February 1945 [[Yalta Conference]] provided for the Soviet Union's participation in the [[Pacific War]]. One of the Soviet conditions for its participation, put forward at Yalta, was that after the war Outer Mongolia would retain its independence.  [[Mongolian independence referendum, 1945|The referendum]] took place on October 20, 1945, with (according to official numbers) 100% of the electorate voting for independence.<ref>Nohlen, D, Grotz, F & Hartmann, C (2001) ''Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II'', p491 {{ISBN|0-19-924959-8}}</ref>

After the establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]], both countries confirmed their mutual recognition on October 6, 1949. However, the [[Republic of China]] used its [[United Nations Security Council veto power|Security Council veto]] in 1955, to stop the admission of the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] to the United Nations on the grounds it recognized all of Mongolia —including Outer Mongolia— as part of China. This was the only time the [[History of the Republic of China|Republic of China]] ever used its veto. Hence, and because of the repeated threats to veto by the ROC, Mongolia did not join the UN until 1961 when the [[Soviet Union]] agreed to lift its veto on the admission of [[Mauritania]] (and any other newly independent African state), in return for the admission of Mongolia. Faced with pressure from nearly all the other African countries, the ROC relented under protest. Mongolia and Mauritania were both admitted to the UN on 27 October 1961.<ref name="unveto">{{cite web| url=http://www.un.org/zh/sc/meetings/veto/pdf/a58_47_p2.pdf| publisher=聯合國| script-title=zh:因常任理事国投反对票而未获通过的决议草案或修正案各段| language=Chinese| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323133412/http://www.un.org/zh/sc/meetings/veto/pdf/a58_47_p2.pdf| archivedate=March 23, 2014| df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="bbcveto">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2828985.stm|title=The veto and how to use it|publisher=BBC News Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726080318/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2828985.stm|archivedate=July 26, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="gpveto">{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/102/32810.html|title=Changing Pattern in the Use of Veto in the Security Council|publisher=Global Policy Forum|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508103405/http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/102/32810.html|archivedate=May 8, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> (see [[China and the United Nations]])

On January 26, 1952, [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] took power in Mongolia after the death of Choibalsan. While Tsedenbal was visiting Moscow in August 1984, his severe illness prompted the parliament to announce his retirement and replace him with [[Jambyn Batmönkh]].

In winter the whole of Mongolia comes under the influence of the [[Siberian Anticyclone]]. The localities most severely affected by this cold weather are Uvs province ([[Ulaangom]]), western Khovsgol ([[Rinchinlkhumbe, Khovsgol|Rinchinlhumbe]]), eastern Zavkhan ([[Tosontsengel, Zavkhan|Tosontsengel]]), northern Bulgan (Hutag) and eastern Dornod province (Khalkhiin Gol). Ulaanbaatar is strongly, but less severely, affected. The cold gets less severe as one goes south, reaching the warmest January temperatures in Omnogovi Province ([[Dalanzadgad]], [[Khanbogd, Ömnögovi|Khanbogd]]) and the region of the Altai mountains bordering China. A unique microclimate is the fertile grassland-forest region of central and eastern Arkhangai Province ([[Tsetserleg (city)|Tsetserleg]]) and northern Ovorkhangai Province ([[Arvaikheer]]) where January temperatures are on average the same and often higher than the warmest desert regions to the south in addition to being more stable. The [[Khangai Mountains]] play a certain role in forming this microclimate.

The country is subject to occasional harsh climatic conditions known as ''[[zud]].'' Zud, which is a natural disaster unique to Mongolia, results in large proportions of the country's livestock dying from starvation or freezing temperatures or both, resulting in economic upheaval for the largely pastoral population. The annual average temperature in Ulaanbaatar is {{cvt|−1.3|°C}}, making it the world's coldest capital city.<ref name=mong26/> Mongolia is high, cold, and windy. It has an extreme continental climate with long, cold winters and short summers, during which most of its annual precipitation falls. The country averages 257 cloudless days a year, and it is usually at the center of a region of high atmospheric pressure. Precipitation is highest in the north (average of {{convert|200|to|350|mm|in|0|sp=us}} per year) and lowest in the south, which receives {{convert|100|to|200|mm|in|0|sp=us}} annually.

The name "Gobi" is a Mongol term for a desert steppe, which usually refers to a category of arid rangeland with insufficient vegetation to support [[marmot]]s but with enough to support [[camel]]s. Mongols distinguish Gobi from desert proper, although the distinction is not always apparent to outsiders unfamiliar with the Mongolian landscape.
[[File:KhongorynElsCamels.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bactrian camels]] by sand dunes in Gobi Desert.]]
[[File:Jurty na stepie pomiędzy Ułan Bator a Karakorum 03.JPG|thumb|[[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland|Mongolian steppe]]]]
Gobi rangelands are fragile and easily destroyed by overgrazing, which results in expansion of the true desert, a stony waste where not even [[Bactrian camel]]s can survive. The arid conditions in the Gobi are attributed to the [[rain shadow effect]] caused by the Himalayas. Before the Himalayas were formed by the collision of the Indo-Australian plate with the Eurasian plate 10 million years ago, Mongolia was a flourishing habitat for major fauna but still somewhat arid and cold due to distance from sources of evaporation. Sea turtle and mollusk fossils have been found in the Gobi, apart from well-known dinosaur fossils. [[Tadpole shrimps]] (''Lepidurus mongolicus'') are still found in the Gobi today. The eastern part of Mongolia including the [[Onon River|Onon]], [[Kherlen River|Kherlen]] rivers and [[Lake Buir]] form part of the [[Amur river]] basin draining to the Pacific Ocean. It hosts some unique species like the Eastern brook lamprey, Daurian crayfish (''cambaroides dauricus'') and Daurian pearl oyster (''dahurinaia dahurica'') in the Onon/Kherlen rivers as well as Siberian prawn (''exopalaemon modestus'') in Lake Buir.

=== Languages ===
The official language of Mongolia is [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], and is spoken by 95% of the population. A variety of [[dialect]]s of [[Oirat language|Oirat]] and [[Buryat language|Buryat]] are spoken across the country, and there are also some speakers of [[Mongolic language|Mongolic]] Khamnigan. In the west of the country, [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Tuvan language|Tuvan]], both [[Turkic languages]], are also spoken. [[Mongolian Sign Language]] is the principal language of the deaf community.

Today, Mongolian is written using the [[Cyrillic alphabet]] in Mongolia, although in the past it was written using the [[Mongolian script]]. An official reintroduction of the old script was planned for 1994, but has not taken place as older generations encountered practical difficulties.<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Ulrich Ammon |author2=Norbert Dittmar |author3=Klaus J.

[[Mongolian shamanism]] has been widely practised throughout the history of what is now Mongolia, with similar beliefs being common among the nomads of central Asia. They gradually gave way to [[Tibetan Buddhism]], but shamanism has left a mark on Mongolian religious culture, and it continues to be practiced. The Kazakhs of western Mongolia, some Mongols, and other Turkic peoples in the country traditionally adhere to [[Islam in Mongolia|Islam]].

Throughout much of the 20th century, the [[Mongolian People's Republic|communist]] government repressed religious practices. It targeted the clergy of the Mongolian Buddhist Church, which had been tightly intertwined with the previous feudal government structures (e.g. from 1911 on, the head of the Church had also been the [[Khan (title)|khan]] of the country).<ref name=eb/> In the late 1930s, the regime, then led by [[Khorloogiin Choibalsan]], closed almost all of Mongolia's over 700 Buddhist monasteries and [[Stalinist repressions in Mongolia|killed at least 30,000 people, of whom 18,000 were lamas]].<ref name="Thirty thousand">{{cite web|url=http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/bullets.pdf|title=Historical Injustice and Democratic Transition in Eastern Asia and Northern Europe, London 2002, p. 156|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-12-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511044943/http://www.chriskaplonski.com/downloads/bullets.pdf|archivedate=May 11, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The number of [[Buddhist monk]]s dropped from 100,000 in 1924 to 110 in 1990.<ref name=eb>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389335/Mongolia |title=Mongolia |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=July 11, 1921 |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514054518/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389335/Mongolia |archivedate=May 14, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The [[fall of communism]] in 1991 restored public religious practice. [[Tibetan Buddhism]], which had been the predominant religion prior to the rise of communism, again rose to become the most widely practised religion in Mongolia. The end of religious repression in the 1990s also allowed for other religions to spread in the country. According to the Christian missionary group [[Barnabas Fund]], the number of Christians grew from just four in 1989 to around 40,000 {{As of|2008|lc=y}}.

The People's Party – known as the People's Revolutionary Party between 1924 and 2010 – formed the government from 1921 to 1996 (in a [[One-party state|one-party system]] until 1990) and from 2000 to 2004. From 2004 to 2006, it was part of a coalition with the Democrats and two other parties, and after 2006 it was the dominant party in two other coalitions.

It begins at the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] in Russia at the town of [[Ulan-Ude]], crosses into Mongolia, runs through Ulaanbaatar, then passes into China at [[Erenhot]] where it joins the Chinese railway system.  A separate railroad link connects the eastern city of [[Choibalsan (city)|Choibalsan]] with the Trans-Siberian Railway. However, that link is closed to passengers after the Mongolian town of [[Chuluunkhoroot]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mongolia/eastern-mongolia/choibalsan/transport/getting-there-away |title=Lonely Planet Mongolia: Choibalsan transport |publisher=Lonelyplanet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514101526/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/mongolia/eastern-mongolia/choibalsan/transport/getting-there-away |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Mongolia has a number of domestic airports with some of them having international status. However, the main international airport is [[Chinggis Khaan International Airport]], located approximately {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from downtown Ulaanbaatar. Direct flight connections exist between Mongolia and South Korea, China, Thailand, Hong Kong, Japan, Russia, Germany, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey. [[MIAT Mongolian Airlines]] is Mongolia's national air carrier operating international flights, while other domestic air carriers such as Aero Mongolia and Hunnu Airlines serve domestic and regional routes.

Many overland roads in Mongolia are only gravel roads or simple cross-country tracks. There are paved roads from Ulaanbaatar to the Russian and Chinese borders, from Ulaanbaatar east- and westward (the so-called Millenium Road), and from Darkhan to [[Bulgan (city)|Bulgan]]. A number of road construction projects are currently underway. Mongolia has {{convert|4800|km|abbr=on}} of paved roads, with {{convert|1800|km|abbr=on}} of that total completed in 2013 alone.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=7086 |title=Tough challenges in 2014 &#124; UBPost News |publisher=Ubpost.mongolnews.mn |date=December 26, 2013 |accessdate=2014-05-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140401041502/http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/?p=7086 |archivedate=April 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Education ===
During the state socialist period, education was one of the areas of significant achievement in Mongolia. Before the [[Mongolian People's Republic|People's Republic]], literacy rates were below one percent. By 1952, illiteracy was virtually eliminated,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Mongolian+People's+Republic|title=Mongolian People's Republic|newspaper=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2016-11-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212105459/http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Mongolian+People's+Republic|archivedate=February 12, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> in part through the use of seasonal boarding schools for children of nomadic families. Funding to these boarding schools was cut in the 1990s, contributing to slightly increased illiteracy.

Primary and secondary education formerly lasted 10 years, but was expanded to 11 years. Since the 2008–2009 school year, new first-graders are using the 12-year system, and a full transition to the 12-year system will not occur until the 2019–2020 school year, when the current{{when|date=February 2019}} third-graders graduate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olloo.mn/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1134602 |title=Зургаан настнууд зутрах шинжтэй |language=Mongolian |publisher=Olloo.mn |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525093517/http://www.olloo.mn/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1134602 |archivedate=May 25, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

{{As of|2006}}, English is taught in all secondary schools across Mongolia, beginning in fourth grade.

Mongolian national universities are all spin-offs from the [[National University of Mongolia]] and the [[Mongolian University of Science and Technology]]. Almost three in five Mongolian youths now enroll in university. There was a six-fold increase in students between 1993 and 2010.<ref>Jakob Engel and Annalisa Prizzon, with Gerelmaa Amgaabazar, July 2014, From decline to recovery: Post-primary education in

The symbol in the left bar of the national flag is a Buddhist icon called [[Soyombo symbol|Soyombo]]. It represents the sun, moon, stars, and heavens per standard cosmological symbology abstracted from that seen in traditional [[thangka]] paintings.

=== Visual arts ===
[[File:White Tara.jpg|thumb|upright|Sita (White) Tara by Öndör Gegeen [[Zanabazar]]. Mongolia, 17th century]]
Before the 20th century, most works of the fine arts in Mongolia had a religious function, and therefore Mongolian fine arts were heavily influenced by religious texts.<ref>{{cite web|author=Terese Tse Bartholomew|year=1995|url=http://www.asianart.com/mongolia/introduct.html|title=Introduction to the Art of Mongolia|publisher=asianart.com|accessdate=2013-03-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306134950/http://www.asianart.com/mongolia/introduct.html|archivedate=March 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Thangkas]] were usually painted or made in [[applique]] technique. Bronze sculptures usually showed Buddhist deities. A number of great works are attributed to the first [[Jebtsundamba Khutuktu]], [[Zanabazar]].

In the late 19th century, painters like [[Marzan Sharav|"Marzan" Sharav]] turned to more realistic painting styles. Under the [[Mongolian People's Republic]], [[socialist realism]] was the dominant painting style,<ref>{{cite book|author=Veronika Ronge|editor=Michael Weiers|title=Die Mongolen: Beiträge zu ihrer Geschichte und Kultur|year=1986|publisher=Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft|isbn=978-3-534-03579-3|pages=125–148|chapter=Kunst und Kunstgewerbe}}</ref> however traditional ''thangka''-like paintings dealing with secular, nationalist themes were also popular, a genre known as "[[Mongol zurag|Mongol ''zurag'']]".

Among the first attempts to introduce [[modernism]] into the fine arts of Mongolia was the painting ''Ehiin setgel'' (''Mother's love'') created by Tsevegjav in the 1960s. The artist was purged as his work was censored.

All forms of fine arts flourished only after "[[Perestroika]]" in the late 1980s. [[Otgonbayar Ershuu]] is arguably one of the most well-known Mongolian modern artists in the Western world, he was portrayed in the film "ZURAG" by Tobias Wulff.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zurag.de/zurag-film.html |title=ZURAG – a movie about Otgonbayar Ershuu |publisher=Zurag.de |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729204853/http://www.zurag.de/zurag-film.html |archivedate=July 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Architecture of Mongolia}}
[[File:Gurvger.jpg|thumb|left|A [[yurt|''ger'']] in front of the [[Gurvan Saikhan Uul|Gurvan Saikhan Mountains]]]]
The traditional Mongolian dwelling is known as a ''ger''.  In the past it was known by the Russian term ''yurt'', but this is changing as the Mongolian term becomes better known among English-speaking countries. According to Mongolian artist and art critic [[N. Chultem]], the ''ger'' was the basis for development of traditional Mongolian architecture. In the 16th and 17th centuries, lamaseries were built throughout the country. Many of them started as ''ger''-temples. When they needed to be enlarged to accommodate the growing number of worshippers, the Mongolian architects used structures with 6 and 12 angles{{clarify|r=is sides or corners meant?|date=April 2011}} with pyramidal roofs to approximate to the round shape of a ''ger''. Further enlargement led to a quadratic shape of the temples. The roofs were made in the shape of marquees.<ref name="Chultem">{{cite book | authorlink = N. Chultem | title = Искусство Монголии | year  =1984 | location = Moscow}}</ref> The trellis walls, roof poles and layers of felt were replaced by stone, brick, beams and planks, and became permanent.<ref>{{cite web | title = Cultural Heritage of Mongolia | url = http://www.indiana.edu/~mongsoc/mong/heritage.htm | publisher = [[Indiana University]] | accessdate = 2007-07-07|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070702015556/http://www.indiana.edu/~mongsoc/mong/heritage.htm |archivedate = July 2, 2007}}</ref>

Chultem distinguished three styles in traditional Mongolian architecture: Mongolian, [[Tibetan architecture|Tibetan]] and [[Chinese architecture|Chinese]] as well as combinations of the three. Among the first quadratic temples was Batu-Tsagaan (1654) designed by [[Zanabazar]]. An example of the ''ger''-style architecture is the lamasery Dashi-Choiling in Ulaanbaatar. The temple Lavrin (18th century) in the [[Erdene Zuu]] lamasery was built in the Tibetan tradition. An example of a temple built in the Chinese tradition is the lamasery Choijing Lamiin Sume (1904), which is a museum today. The quadratic temple Tsogchin in lamasery Gandan in Ulaanbaatar is a combination of the Mongolian and Chinese tradition. The temple of Maitreya (disassembled in 1938) is an example of the Tibeto-Mongolian architecture.<ref name="Chultem" /> Dashi-Choiling monastery has commenced a project to restore the temple and the {{convert|25|m|ft}} sculpture of Maitreya.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Mongolia}}
[[File:Mongolian Musician.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Musician playing the traditional Mongolian musical instrument [[morin khuur]]]]
The music of Mongolia is strongly influenced by nature, nomadism, shamanism, and also Tibetan Buddhism. The traditional music includes a variety of instruments, famously the [[morin khuur]], and also the singing styles like the [[Long song|urtyn duu]] ("long song"), and throat-singing ([[Tuvan throat singing#Khoomei|khoomei]]). The "tsam" is danced to keep away evil spirits and it was seen the reminiscences of shamaning.

The first rock band of Mongolia was [[Soyol Erdene]], founded in the 1960s. Their [[The Beatles|Beatles]]-like manner was severely criticized by the Communist censorship. It was followed by Mungunhurhree, Ineemseglel, Urgoo, etc., carving out the path for the genre in the harsh environment of Communist ideology. Mungunhurhree and [[Haranga]] were to become the pioneers in the Mongolia's heavy rock music. Haranga approached its zenith in the late 1980s and 1990s.

The leader of Haranga, famous guitarist Enh-Manlai, generously helped the growth of the following generations of rockers. Among the followers of Haranga was the band [[Hurd (band)|Hurd]]. In the early 1990s, group Har-Chono put the beginning for Mongolia's folk-rock, merging elements of the Mongolian traditional "[[long song]]" into the genre.

By that time, the environment for development of artistic thought had become largely liberal thanks to the new democratic society in the country. The 1990s saw development of rap, techno, hip-hop and also boy bands and girl bands flourish at the turn of the millennium.

=== Sports and festivals ===

[[File:Naadamceremony2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[Naadam]] is the largest summer celebration]]
The main national festival is [[Naadam]], which has been organised for centuries and takes place over three days in the summer, consists of three Mongolian traditional sports, [[archery]], cross-country horse-racing, and wrestling, traditionally recognized as the Three Manly Games of Naadam. In modern-day Mongolia, Naadam is held on July 11 to 13 in the honour of the anniversaries of the National Democratic Revolution and foundation of the Great Mongol State.

Another very popular activity called Shagaa is the "flicking" of sheep ankle bones at a target several feet away, using a flicking motion of the finger to send the small bone flying at targets and trying to knock the target bones off the platform. At Naadam, this contest is very popular and develops a serious audience among older Mongolians.
[[File:Three Naadam riders.jpg|thumb|left|Riders during [[Naadam]] festival]]

[[Horse culture in Mongolia|Horse riding]] is especially central to Mongolian culture. The long-distance races that are showcased during Naadam festivals are one aspect of this, as is the popularity of trick riding. One example of trick riding is the legend that the Mongolian military hero [[Damdin Sükhbaatar]] scattered coins on the ground and then picked them up while riding a horse at full gallop.

[[File:Mongolskie zapasy na lokalnym festiwalu Naadam (24).jpg|thumb|Traditional [[Mongolian wrestling]]]]
[[Mongolian wrestling]] is the most popular of all Mongol sports. It is the highlight of the Three Manly Games of Naadam. Historians claim that Mongol-style wrestling originated some seven thousand years ago. Hundreds of wrestlers from different cities and aimags around the country take part in the national wrestling competition.

Other sports such as basketball, [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], and association football, athletics, gymnastics, table tennis, [[jujutsu]], [[karate]], [[aikido]], [[kickboxing]], [[mixed martial arts]] have become popular in Mongolia. More Mongolian table tennis players are competing internationally.

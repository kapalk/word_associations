{{Main|Name of the Philippines}}
[[File:Philip II portrait by Titian.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Philip II of Spain]]]]

The Philippines was named in honor of [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip&nbsp;II of Spain]]. Spanish explorer [[Ruy López de Villalobos]], during his expedition in 1542, named the islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]] ''{{lang|es|Felipinas}}'' after the then-[[Prince of Asturias]]. Eventually the name ''{{lang|es|Las Islas Filipinas}}'' would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago. Before that became commonplace, other names such as ''{{lang|es|Islas del Poniente}}'' (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands ''{{lang|es|San Lázaro}}'' were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=15KZU-yMuisC |title=Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society |last=Scott |first=William Henry |authorlink=William Henry Scott (historian) |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |year=1994 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=15KZU-yMuisC&pg=PA6 6] |isbn=978-971-550-135-4 }}</ref><ref name="Spate">{{Cite book |url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/spanish_lake/mobile_devices/ |chapterurl=http://epress.anu.edu.au/spanish_lake/mobile_devices/ch04s05.html |title=The Spanish Lake – The Pacific since Magellan, Volume I |chapter=Chapter 4.

The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of its history.

From the period of the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898) and the [[Philippine–American War]] (1899–1902) until the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] period (1935–1946), American colonial authorities referred to the country as the ''Philippine Islands'', a translation of the Spanish name.<ref name="Constantino1975">{{cite book |last1=Constantino |first1=R |title=The Philippines: a Past Revisited |date=1975 |publisher=Tala Pub.

The [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian Expansion Theory]] explains that [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesians]] coming from [[Taiwan]] began migrating to the Philippines around 4000&nbsp;BC, displacing earlier arrivals.<ref name=mijares2006>{{cite journal|last=Mijares|first=Armand Salvador B.|year=2006|url=http://ejournal.anu.edu.au/index.php/bippa/article/viewFile/10/9|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707050814/http://ejournal.anu.edu.au/index.php/bippa/article/viewFile/10/9|archivedate=July 7, 2014|title=The Early Austronesian Migration To Luzon: Perspectives From The Peñablanca Cave Sites|journal=Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association|issue=26|pages=72–78}}</ref>

Based on archeological findings, trade with China is believed to have begun in the [[Tang dynasty]], but grew more extensive during the [[Song dynasty]].<ref name="Scott1994" /> By the 2nd millennium CE, some (but not all) Philippine polities were known to have sent trade delegations which participated in the Tributary system enforced by the Chinese imperial court.<ref name="Scott1994" />  These "tributary states" nominally acknowledged the [[Sinocentrism|Sinocentric system]] which saw China and the imperial court as the cultural center of the world.

During its rule, Spain quelled [[Philippine revolts against Spain|various indigenous revolts]]. There were also several external military challenges from Chinese and Japanese pirates, the Dutch, the English, the Portuguese and the Muslims of Southeast Asia. Those challengers were fought off despite the hostile forces having encircled the Philippine archipelago in a crescent formed from Japan to Indonesia. The Philippines was maintained at a considerable cost during Spanish rule. The long war against the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] from the West, in the 17th century, together with the intermittent conflict with the Muslims in the South and combating Japanese-Chinese [[Wokou]] piracy from the North nearly bankrupted the colonial treasury.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dolan|1991}}, [http://countrystudies.us/philippines/4.htm The Early Spanish Period].</ref> Furthermore, the state of near constant wars caused a high death and desertion rate among the Latino soldiers sent from Mexico and Peru that were stationed in the Philippines.<ref>Garcıa de los Arcos, “Grupos etnicos,” ´ 65–66</ref> This left only the fittest and strongest to survive and serve out their military service. The high death and desertion rates also applied to the native Filipino warriors and laborers levied by Spain, to fight in battles all across the archipelago and elsewhere or build galleons and public works. The repeated wars, lack of wages, dislocation and near starvation were so intense, almost half of the soldiers sent from Latin America and the warriors and laborers recruited locally either died or fled to the lawless countryside to live as vagabonds among the rebellious natives, escaped enslaved Indians (From India)<ref>The Diversity and Reach of the Manila Slave Market Page 36</ref> and Negrito nomads, where they race-mixed through rape or prostitution, which further blurred the racial caste system Spain tried so hard to maintain in the towns and cities.<ref name="ReferenceC">Tomás de Comyn, general manager of the Compañia Real de Filipinas, in 1810 estimated that out of a total population of 2,515,406, “the European Spaniards, and Spanish creoles and mestizos do not exceed 4,000 persons of both sexes and all ages, and the distinct castes or modifications known in America under the name of mulatto, quarteroons, etc., although found in the Philippine Islands, are generally confounded in the three classes of pure Indians, Chinese mestizos and Chinese.” In other words, the Mexicans who had arrived in the previous century had so intermingled with the local population that distinctions of origin had been forgotten by the 19th century. The Mexicans who came with Legázpi and aboard succeeding vessels had blended with the local residents so well that their country of origin had been erased from memory.</ref> These circumstances contributed to the increasing difficulty of governing the Philippines. Due to these, the Royal Fiscal of Manila wrote a letter to [[King Charles III of Spain]], in which he advises to abandon the colony, but this was successfully opposed by the religious and missionary orders that argued that the Philippines was a launching pad for further conversions in the Far East.<ref>Blair, E., Robertson, J., & Bourne, E.

==== Administrative regions ====
{{Main|Regions of the Philippines}}

''Regions'' in the Philippines are [[administrative divisions of the Philippines|administrative divisions]] that serve primarily to organize the [[provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] of the country for administrative convenience. The Philippines is divided into 17 regions (16 administrative and 1 [[Bangsamoro|autonomous]]). Most government offices are established by region instead of individual provincial offices, usually (but not always) in the city designated as the regional center. {{as of|2015}}, [[CALABARZON]] was the most populated region while the [[Metro Manila|National Capitol Region]] (NCR) the most densely populated.

Philippine culture is a combination of [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western culture]]s. The Philippines exhibits aspects found in other Asian countries with a [[Malay people|Malay]]<ref>Baringer, Sally E. [c. 2006].

Retrieved December 20, 2009 from www.everyculture.com.</ref> heritage, yet its culture also displays a significant number of [[Culture of Spain|Spanish]] and [[Culture of the United States|American]] influences. Traditional festivities known as ''barrio fiestas'' (district festivals) to commemorate the feast days of patron saints are common, these community celebrations are times for feasting, music, and dancing. The [[Ati-Atihan Festival|Ati-Atihan]], [[Moriones Festival|Moriones]] and [[Sinulog]] festivals are a couple of the most well-known.

Some traditions, however, are changing or gradually being forgotten due to modernization. The [[Bayanihan Philippine National Folk Dance Company]] has been lauded for preserving many of the various traditional folk dances found throughout the Philippines. They are famed for their iconic performances of Philippine dances such as the ''[[tinikling]]'' and ''[[singkil]]'' that both feature clashing bamboo poles.<ref name="lonelyplanet44">{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=aaUR07G0yAcC&pg=PA44 |title = Philippines |author1 = Rowthorn, Chris |author2 = Greg Bloom |lastauthoramp = yes |edition = 9th |publisher =Lonely Planet|year = 2006 |page = 44 |isbn = 978-1-74104-289-4}}</ref>

One of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of [[Catálogo Alfabético de Apellidos|Spanish names and surnames]] among Filipinos; a Spanish name and surname, however, does not necessarily denote Spanish ancestry. This peculiarity, unique among the people of Asia, came as a result of a colonial edict by Governor-General [[Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa, 1st Count of Manila|Narciso Clavería y Zaldua]], which ordered the systematic distribution of family names and implementation of [[Spanish naming customs|Hispanic nomenclature]] on the population.<ref name=Dumont>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=zMFKs8--FDMC&pg=PA160 |title = Visayan Vignettes: Ethnographic Traces of a Philippine Island |author = Dumont, Jean-Paul |publisher = University of Chicago Press |location = Chicago |year = 1992 |pages = 160–162 |isbn = 978-0-226-16954-5}}</ref>
The names of many streets, towns, and provinces are also in Spanish.

The common use of the English language is an example of the American impact on Philippine society. It has contributed to the ready acceptance and influence of American pop cultural trends. This affinity is seen in Filipinos' love of [[fast food]] and American film and music. Fast food outlets are found on many street corners. American global fast food chain stalwarts have entered the market, but local fast food chains like [[Goldilocks Bakeshop|Goldilocks]] and most notably [[Jollibee]], the leading fast food chain in the country, have emerged and compete successfully against their foreign rivals.<ref name=Jollibee>{{cite web|url = http://www.jollibee.com.ph/corporate/phenomenon.htm |archivedate = June 23, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070623034806/http://www.jollibee.com.ph/corporate/phenomenon.htm |title = The Jollibee Phenomenon |publisher = Jollibee Inc. |accessdate = January 9, 2008}}</ref><ref name=Jollibee2>{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/30/business/worldbusiness/30iht-burger.html?pagewanted=all |title = Jollibee stings McDonald's in Philippines |author = Conde, Carlos H. |newspaper =The New York Times|date = May 31, 2005 |accessdate = January 5, 2010}}</ref>

=== Architecture ===

[[File:Calle Crisologo, Vigan Ilocos Sur.JPG|thumb|Colonial houses in [[Vigan]].]]
[[Spanish architecture]] has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or ''plaza mayor'', but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II.<ref name=Ring /> Some examples remain, mainly among the country's churches, government buildings, and universities.

The [[American occupation of the Philippines|American occupation]] in 1898 introduced a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and [[Art Deco]] theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by [[Daniel Burnham]] was done on the portions of the city of [[Manila]]. Part of the Burnham plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled [[Greek architecture|Greek]] or [[Neoclassical architecture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ncca.gov.ph/subcommissions/subcommission-on-the-arts-sca/architecture-and-allied-arts-2/history-of-philippine-architecture/|title=History of Philippine Architecture|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts|access-date=September 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170421020700/http://ncca.gov.ph/subcommissions/subcommission-on-the-arts-sca/architecture-and-allied-arts-2/history-of-philippine-architecture/|archive-date=April 21, 2017|dead-url=yes}}</ref> In [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American occupation in the country can still be seen.

However, certain areas of the country like [[Batanes]] have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate. Limestones and coral were used as building materials.<ref name=nccabatanes>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=4&i=226|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419094805/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=4&i=226|archivedate=April 19, 2015|date=April 19, 2015|title=The Batanes Islands|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts|last=Datar|first=Francisco A.}}</ref> [[Idjangs]] or [[Ivatan people|Ivatan]] castles were the primary shelter of the people prior to the Spanish conquest of the whole Philippines.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.filipiknow.net/archaeological-discoveries-in-the-philippines/#more-4493|title=15 Most Intense Archaeological Discoveries in Philippine History|website=FilipiKnow}}</ref>

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of the Philippines|Original Pilipino Music}}
[[File:Kulintang 03.jpg|thumb|left|Percussion instruments that make up the Philippine [[kulintang]] ensemble, an example of pre-Hispanic musical tradition]]
Philippine music has evolved rapidly due to the different influences stemming from colonialism under other countries. Before the Spanish conquest of the islands, most music was reminiscent of, or heavily influenced by, nature. Some examples of this tribal music is ''Koyu No Tebulul'' of the [[Tboli people|T'boli]] and Ambo Hato of the [[Ifugao]]. This genre is often accompanied by gong music and one well known instrument is the [[Kulintang]].

During the Spanish era [[Rondalya]] music, where traditional string orchestra [[mandolin]] type instruments were used, was widespread. In the Philippines, ''Rondalya'' refers to any group of stringed instruments that are played using a plectrum or pick. Filipino instruments are made from indigenous Philippine wood; plectrums, or picks, are made from tortoise-shell. Other stringed instruments composing the standard Filipino rondalla are the 14-string bandurria found only in the Philippines, the laúd, the octavina, the Twelve-string guitar, the Ukulele, the bajo de uñas or double bass, the Guitarrón mexicano, and other Filipino-made instruments modeled and developed after the guitar. [[Harana (serenade)|Harana]] and [[Kundiman]] are prevalent during this time wherein these songs are often used in courtship rituals.<ref name=aboutpmusic>{{cite web|url=http://aboutphilippines.ph/filer/toledo-cebu/PHILIPPINE%20MUSIC.pdf|date=June 20, 2015 |title=PHILIPPINE MUSIC|publisher=Balikbayan family-union – AboutPhilippines|author1=Anupol|author2=Cayabyab|author3=Chua|author4=Luarca|author5=Shimamoto|author6=Torio|author7=Yumol}}{{dead link|date=February 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Marcelo Adonay (organist), Simplicio Solis (organist), Diego C. Perez (pianist), Jose Conseco (pianist) and [[Dolores Paterno|Doña Dolores Paterno]] (composer) were some of the recognized musicians in this era. Nowadays, American pop culture has a heavy hold on the Filipinos that evolved from the Spanish times when the American occupation happened. Along with Korean pop, these two are dominating the recent music scene in media.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8989687|title=Reason Behind the Rising Popularity of K-Pop in the Philippines|author=Alyssa Kristin Cruz|website=academia.edu}}</ref><ref name=nccamusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=1&i=157|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724223121/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=1&i=157 |archivedate=July 24, 2014|date=July 25, 2014 |title=Popular Music in the Philippines|last=Baes|first=Jonas|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts}}</ref> However, the revival of Spanish-influence folk music has been possible thanks to the different choir groups coming in and going out of the country, such as the [[Philippine Madrigal Singers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/move-ph/balikbayan/39564-choirs-filipino-classics|title=Choirs around the world take on Filipino classics|website=Rappler}}</ref>

=== Dance ===

[[File:Folklore of the popular heritage of the State of the Philippines 05.jpg|thumb|[[Cariñosa]], a Hispanic era dance for traditional Filipino courtship.]]

Just like the evolution of Philippine music, dance as well has been in constant change. Prior to colonial rule, the Philippines had a wide array of ethnic dances from different tribal groups. This was due mainly to the fact that Philippines is an archipelago thus the different varieties of dance developed. Both Luzon and Visayas, at first, were more akin to tribal movements until the Spanish came. Mindanao represents more of an array of Muslim inspired dances and Spanish influence was limited to the region of [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]].

Universal dances in the Philippines are found at societal functions such as rituals, mimicry, life cycle and parties. During the Spanish era, most dances were accompanied by Rondalya music usually with 14-string bandurrias that the Filipinos invented or by other type of stringed instruments that locally evolved in to the culture as well.

One famous dance that is well known is called the [[Tinikling]], where a band of Rondalya musicians play along with the percussive beat of the two bamboo poles. It usually starts with men and women acting a scene about "How rural townsfolk mingle". The dancers then graze thru the clashing of the bamboo poles held on opposite sides. The end displays the paired bamboo poles crossing each other. The Muslim version of this where bamboo poles are also used is called the [[Singkil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stringsofunity.com/rondalla-history.html|title=Strings of Unity|last=Felix|first=Marcus|website=stringsofunity.com|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}</ref>

[[Cariñosa]] is a Hispanic Filipino dance, unofficially considered as the "National Dance of the Philippines". It's a courtship dance which involves a woman holding a fan or a handkerchief, where it plays an instrumental role as it places the couple in romance scenario.

Nowadays, in the Modern and Post-Modern time periods, dances may vary from the delicate ballet up to the more street-oriented styles of breakdancing to name a few.<ref name=nccadance>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=1&i=117|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140724234241/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/articles-on-c-n-a/article.php?igm=1&i=117 |archivedate=July 24, 2014|date=July 24, 2014 |title=Philippine Dance in the American Period|publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts|first=Basilio Esteban S.|last=Villacruz}}</ref>

Pottery and weaving are among the very first art forms showcasing Filipino artistic design and are evident from cave dwellings all over the country. Among these are mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5&nbsp;BC to 225&nbsp;AD. Weaving was mostly done by women, using fibers from abaca, pineapple, cotton, and bark to make clothes, rugs and hats. Baskets were mostly utilized to carry grain and other foods.<ref name="slideshare1">{{cite web|last=Sotto |first=Trish |url=http://www.slideshare.net/TrishSotto/fa-28-weaving-history |title=Fa 28 weaving history |publisher=Slideshare.net |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name="nationalmuseum1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Pots.html |title=Anthropomorphic Pots : Metal Age : Ayub Cave, Saranggani Province |publisher=National Museum of the Philippines |accessdate=February 22, 2015}}</ref>

Early Philippine sculpture is characterized by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms is the ''[[Bulul|bulols]]'' by the [[Ifugao]] people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original functions of these sculptures are related to the ceremonies and beliefs of the tribes who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of ''[[Okir|Okkil]]''. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of [[Sulu]]. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery.<ref name="wiziq1">{{cite web|url=http://www.wiziq.com/tutorial/159187-HISTORY-OF-PHILIPPINE-PAINTING |title=History Of Philippine Painting |publisher=Wiziq.com |date= |accessdate=August 1, 2013}}</ref>

Paintings of early [[Modern art|modernist]] painters such as [[Damián Domingo]] often still had a religious association but the art of [[Juan Luna]] and [[Félix Resurrección Hidalgo|Félix Hidalgo]] showed a trend towards political statement. The first Philippine national artist [[Fernando Amorsolo]] used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated aspects of Philippine culture, while other artists such as [[Fernando Zóbel de Ayala y Montojo|Fernando Zóbel]] used both realistic and [[Abstract art|abstract]] techniques.

In the modern period, statuary was integrated with architecture in the Art Deco style. Examples can be seen in statues throughout the country especially in public parks and spaces.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3_ocHJ0_t44C|title=Humanities and the Digital Art|edition=2006|isbn=978-971-23-4628-6|year=2006|pages=[https://books.google.com/?id=3_ocHJ0_t44C&pg=PA31&lpg=PA31&dq=history+philippine+sculptures#v=onepage&q=history%20philippine%20sculptures&f=false 31-32]}}</ref>

=== Values ===
{{Further|Filipino values}}

As a general description, the distinct [[value system]] of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly [[Christianity]]), and commercial relationships.<ref name=CAPH>[http://countrystudies.us/philippines/41.htm ''Social Values and Organization''], Philippines, Country Studies US. Online version of print book Ronald E. Dolan, ed. ''Philippines: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1991.</ref>

Filipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group.<ref name="Phil" /> The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of "''Hiya''", roughly translated as 'a sense of shame', and "''Amor propio''" or 'self-esteem'.<ref name="Phil">{{cite book|author1=Chris Rowthorn|author2=Greg Bloom|title=Philippines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaUR07G0yAcC|year=2006|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-289-4}}</ref> Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns.

Other elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.<ref name=CRVP2>{{cite web |last=Talisayon |first=Serafin |url=http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-7/chapter_xiii.htm|title=Filipino Values, Chapter XIII, Teaching Values in the Natural and Physical Sciences in the Philippines |website=crvp.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417164213/http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-7/chapter_xiii.htm|archivedate=April 17, 2016|publisher=The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy (RVP), [[The Catholic University of America]]|date=1994}} File dated April 8, 2000.

Filipino cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its [[Malayo-Polynesian]] origins to become a mixed cuisine with many [[Hispanic]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], and other [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the ''[[paella]]s'' and ''[[cozido|cocidos]]'' created for fiestas.<ref name=Jollibee2 /><ref name=Zialcita />

Popular dishes include ''[[lechon|lechón]]'', ''[[Adobo (Filipino cuisine)|adobo]]'', ''[[sinigang]]'', ''[[kare-kare]]'', ''[[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|tapa]]'', [[Crispy pata|crispy ''pata'']], ''[[pancit]]'', ''[[lumpia]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]''. Some common local ingredients used in cooking are [[calamansi]], coconuts, ''[[Saba banana|saba]]'' (a kind of short wide [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]), [[mangoes]], [[purple yam|ube]], [[milkfish]], and [[fish sauce]]. Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors, but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors.<ref name=Jollibee2 /><ref name=Zialcita>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=PEy9G-HLokwC&pg=PA281 |title = Authentic Though not Exotic: Essays on Filipino Identity

Unlike many Asians, most Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Filipino cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork.<ref name="lonelyplanet48">{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=aaUR07G0yAcC&pg=PA48&dq=filipino+cuisine&q=filipino%20cuisine |title = Philippines |author1 = Rowthorn, Chris |author2 = Greg Bloom |lastauthoramp = yes |edition = 9th |publisher =Lonely Planet|year = 2006 |page = 48 |isbn = 978-1-74104-289-4}}</ref>

This recent trend also sometimes incorporates the "Boodle Fight" concept (as popularized and coined by the Philippine Army), wherein banana leaves are used as giant plates on top of which rice portions and Filipino viands are placed all together for a filial, friendly and/or communal ''kamayan'' feasting.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20141019154051/http://captain-as.com/what-is-boodle-fight/ Captain A's Seafood Grill] In Philippine usage, the boodle fight is a military academy terminology for "eating combat" or "attack the food."</ref>

[[File:Jose rizal 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[José Rizal]] is a pioneer of [[Philippine Revolution]] through his literary works.]]
Philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people. While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the ''[[aswang]]'', the ''[[manananggal]]'', the ''[[diwata]]/[[engkanto]]'', and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are [[Maria Makiling]], [[Biag ni Lam-Ang|Lam-Ang]], and the [[Sarimanok]].<ref name=Lopez>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jGssp-oJrT8C&printsec=frontcover |title=A Handbook of Philippine Folklore |author=Lopez, Mellie Leandicho |publisher=University of the Philippines Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-971-542-514-8}}</ref>

[[File:Brillante Mendoza at the 69th Venice International Film Festival, September 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Brillante Mendoza]] is a prominent Filipino film director.]]
''Salón de Pertierra'' was the first introduced moving picture on January 1, 1897 in the Philippines. All films were all in Spanish since Philippine cinema was first introduced during the final years of the Spanish era of the country. [[Antonio Ramos]] was the first known movie producer. He used the Lumiere Cinematograph when he filmed ''Panorama de Manila'' (Manila landscape), ''Fiesta de Quiapo'' (Quiapo Fiesta), ''Puente de España'' (Bridge of Spain), and ''Escenas Callejeras'' (Street scenes). Meanwhile, [[Jose Nepomuceno]] was dubbed as the "Father of Philippine Cinema".<ref>[http://su.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:200615 "The Role of José Nepomuceno in the Philippine Society: What language did his silent film speaks?"]. Stockholm University Publications. Retrieved on January 6, 2011.</ref> Dubbed as the "Father of Philippine Cinema", his work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines.<ref name="books.google.com"/> His first film produced was entitled ''[[Dalagang Bukid]]'' (Country Maiden) in 1919.

Film showing resumed in 1900 during the [[American occupation of the Philippines|American period]]. Walgrah, a British entrepreneur, opened the ''Cine Walgrah at No. 60 Calle Santa Rosa'' in [[Intramuros]]. It was also during this time that a movie market was formally created in the country along with the arrival of [[silent film|silent movies]]. These silent films were always accompanied by [[phonograph|gramophone]], a piano, a [[quartet]], or a 200-man choir. During the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]], filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of [[Philippine cinema]] with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures.

During the 1960s, [[James Bond]] movies, ''bomba'' (soft porn) pictures and an era of musical films, produced mostly by [[Sampaguita Pictures]], dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in [[Hollywood]] films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s.<ref name="bleak">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070401080345/http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/02/11/yourmoney/movies12.php A bleak storyline for the Filipino film industry].

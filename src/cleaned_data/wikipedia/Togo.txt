'''Togo''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Togo.ogg|ˈ|t|oʊ|ɡ|oʊ}}), officially the '''Togolese Republic''' ({{lang-fr|République togolaise}}), is a country in [[West Africa]] bordered by [[Ghana]] to the west, [[Benin]] to the east and [[Burkina Faso]] to the north. The [[sovereign state]] extends south to the [[Gulf of Guinea]], where its [[capital city|capital]] [[Lomé]] is located. Togo covers {{convert|57,000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}, making it one of the smallest countries in Africa, with a population of approximately {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Togo}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}}

From the 11th to the 16th century, various tribes entered the region from all directions. From the 16th century to the 18th century, the coastal region was a major trading center for Europeans to search for slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name "The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]". In 1884, [[German Empire|Germany]] declared a region including present-day Togo as a protectorate called [[Togoland]]. After [[World War I]], rule over Togo was transferred to [[France]]. Togo gained its independence from France in 1960.<ref name="cia"/> In 1967, [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]] led a successful military coup d'état after which he became president of an anti-communist, single-party state. Eventually in 1993, Eyadéma faced multiparty elections, which were marred by irregularities, and won the presidency three times. At the time of his death, Eyadéma was the longest-serving leader in modern African history, having been president for 38 years.<ref name=Obituary>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/830774.stm "Obituary: Gnassingbe Eyadema"]. (5 February 2005). [[BBC News]]. Retrieved 22 May 2007.</ref><!--Not sure if Eyadéma should really be mentioned here, but while he is, it's better to have some more info on him.?-->  In 2005, his son [[Faure Gnassingbé]] was elected president.

Togo is a [[tropical]], [[sub-Saharan]] nation, whose economy depends highly on [[agriculture]], with a [[climate]] that provides good growing seasons. While the official language is French, many other languages are spoken in Togo, particularly those of the [[Gbe languages|Gbe family]]. The largest [[religious denomination|religious group]] in Togo consists of those with indigenous beliefs, and there are significant [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Muslim]] minorities. Togo is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[African Union]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], [[South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], and [[Economic Community of West African States]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Togo}}

=== Before colonization (-1884) ===
Archaeological finds indicate that ancient tribes were able to produce [[pottery]] and process [[iron]]. The name Togo is translated from the [[Ewe language]] as "land where lagoons lie". Not much is known of the period before arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1490. During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century, various tribes entered the region from all directions: the [[Ewe people|Ewé]] from the east, and the [[Gen language|Mina]] and [[Fon language|Gun]] from the west. Most of them settled in coastal areas.

The [[slave trade]] began in the 16th century, and for the next two hundred years the coastal region was a major trading centre for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name "The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]".

=== Colonial era (1884–1960) ===
{{Main article|Togoland|British Togoland|French Togoland}}
[[File:Togoland.jpg|thumb|left|Togoland ([[Rudolf Hellgrewe|R. Hellgrewe]], 1908)]]

In 1884, a paper was signed at [[Togoville]] with the King Mlapa III, whereby Germany claimed a [[protectorate]] over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland. Its borders were defined after the capture of hinterland by German forces and signing agreements with France and Britain. In 1905, this became the [[German colonial empire|German colony]] of [[Togoland]]. The local population was forced to work, cultivate cotton, coffee and cocoa and pay high taxes. A railway and the port of [[Lomé]] were built for export of agricultural products. The Germans introduced modern techniques of cultivation of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]] and [[cotton]] and developed the infrastructure.

During the [[First World War]], Togoland was invaded by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]], proclaiming the Anglo-French condominium. On 7 December 1916 the condominium collapsed and Togo was divided into British and French zones. 20 July 1922 Great Britain received the [[League of Nations]] mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. In 1945, the country received the right to send three representatives to the French parliament.

After [[World War II]], these mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territories]]. The residents of [[British Togoland]] voted to join the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as part of the new independent nation of [[Ghana]] in 1957. [[French Togoland]] became an autonomous republic within the [[French Union]] in 1959, while France retained the right to control the defense, foreign relations and finances.

=== Independence to present day (1960–present) ===
[[File:Sylvanus Olympio.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvanus Olympio]]|left]]

The Togolese Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960.  In the [[Togolese general election, 1961|first presidential elections]] in 1961, [[Sylvanus Olympio]] became the first president, gaining 100% of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition. On 9 April 1961 the Constitution of the Togolese Republic was adopted, according to which the supreme legislative body was the [[National Assembly of Togo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In December 1961, leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy. A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on France by establishing cooperation with the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]] and [[Germany]]. He also rejected efforts of French soldiers who were demobilized after the [[Algerian War]] and tried to get a position in the Togolese army. These factors eventually led to a military coup on 13 January 1963, during which he was [[assassinate]]d by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]].<ref name="ellis93">{{cite journal | last = Ellis | first = Stephen | title = Rumour and Power in Togo | journal = Africa: Journal of the International African Institute | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 462–476 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1993 | jstor = 1161002 }}</ref> A State of emergency was declared in Togo.

The military handed over power to an interim government led by [[Nicolas Grunitzky]]. In May 1963 Grunitzky was [[Togolese general election, 1963|elected]] President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with France. His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.

Exactly four years later, on 13 January 1967, Eyadéma Gnassingbé overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency. He created the [[Rally of the Togolese People|Rally of the Togolese People Party]], banned activities of other political parties and introduced a one-party system in November 1969. He was reelected in [[Togolese general election, 1979|1979]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 1986|1986]]. In 1983, the [[privatization]] program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, the EU froze the partnership, describing Eyadema's re-election in [[Togolese presidential election, 1993|1993]], [[Togolese presidential election, 1998|1998]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 2003|2003]], as a seizure of power. In April 2004, in Brussels, talks were held between the [[European Union]] and Togo on the resumption of cooperation.

Eyadéma Gnassingbé suddenly died on 5 February 2005 after 38 years in power, the longest occupation of any dictator in Africa. The military's immediate installation of his son, [[Faure Gnassingbé]], as president provoked widespread international condemnation, except from France. Some democratically elected African leaders such as [[Abdoulaye Wade]] of [[Senegal]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of [[Nigeria]] supported the move, thereby creating a rift within the [[African Union]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14106781 BBC News – Togo country profile – Overview]. Bbc.co.uk (11 July 2011). Retrieved on 26 March 2012.</ref>

Gnassingbe left power and held elections, which he won two months later. The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent. The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to [[democracy]] that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with the [[European Union|EU]], which cut off [[aid]] in 1993 due to questions about Togo's human rights situation. In addition, up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the [[United Nations|UN]]. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighboring countries. [[Faure Gnassingbé]] was reelected in [[Togolese presidential election, 2010|2010]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 2015|2015]].

In late 2017, [[Anti-government protests in Togo, 2017|anti-government protests]] erupted in Togo, the biggest since ones after the [[Togolese presidential election, 2005|2005 election]]. They demand the resignation of Gnassingbé, who is part of a family they say has been in power too long. The UN has condemned the resulting crackdown by Togolese security forces, and [[The Gambia|Gambia's]] foreign minister, [[Ousainou Darboe]], had to issue a correction after saying that Gnassingbé should resign.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-togo/togos-president-gnassingbe-should-resign-immediately-gambian-foreign-minister-idUSKBN1CS1W7|title=Gambian ministry says up to Togo to resolve crisis|last=Farge|first=Emma|date=2017-10-23|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-10-26|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:To-map.png|right|thumb|Map of Togo]]
{{Main|Geography of Togo}}
Togo has an area equal to {{convert|21925|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and is one of the smallest countries in Africa. It borders the [[Bight of Benin]] in the south; [[Ghana]] lies to the west; [[Benin]] to the east; and to the north, Togo is bound by [[Burkina Faso]]. Togo lies mostly between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6°]] and [[11th parallel north|11°N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0°]] and [[2nd meridian east|2°E]].

The coast of Togo in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] is 56&nbsp;km long and consists of lagoons with sandy beaches. In the north the land is characterized by a gently rolling [[savanna]] in contrast to the center of the country, which is characterized by hills. The south of Togo is characterized by a [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic|savanna and woodland plateau]] which reaches to a coastal plain with extensive lagoons and marshes.

The highest [[mountain]] of the country is the [[Mont Agou]] at 986 m above sea level. The longest [[river]] is the [[Mono River]] with a length of 400&nbsp;km. It runs from north to south.

=== Climate ===
{{main|Climate of Togo}}
The climate is generally tropical with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|23|°C}} on the coast to about {{convert|30|°C}} in the northernmost regions, with a dry climate and characteristics of a [[tropical savanna]]. To the south there are two seasons of rain (the first between April and July and the second between September and November), even though the average rainfall is not very high.

=== Flora and fauna ===
The coast of Togo is characterized by [[marshes]] and [[mangroves]]. High human population growth is leading to rapid [[deforestation]], endangering many species. At least four parks and reserves have been established: [[Abdoulaye Faunal Reserve]], [[Fazao Malfakassa National Park]], [[Fosse aux Lions National Park]], [[Koutammouko]], and [[Kéran National Park]]. The most frequently observed animals are [[giraffes]], [[cape buffalo]], [[hyenas]], and [[lions]]. Few elephants remain. Common [[birds]] are [[storks]], [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[Marabou stork|marabou]].

== Government ==
{{Main|Politics of Togo}}
[[File:Faure Gnassingbé 2014.png|thumb|upright|Current president of Togo [[Faure Gnassingbé]] since 2005]]
[[File:Gnassingbé Eyadema, 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]] ruled Togo from 1967 until his death in 2005]]

The President is elected by universal and direct suffrage for 5 years. He is also the commander of the [[Togolese Armed Forces|armed forces]] and has the right to initiate legislation and dissolve [[parliament]]. Executive power is exercised by the president and the government. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the president.

Togo's transition to democracy is stalled. Its democratic institutions remain nascent and fragile. President [[Gnassingbé Eyadéma]], who ruled Togo under a one-party system, died of a heart attack on 5 February 2005. Gravely ill, he was being transported by plane to a foreign country for care. He died in transit while over Tunisia. Under the Togolese Constitution, the President of the Parliament, [[Fambaré Ouattara Natchaba]], should have become President of the country, pending a new presidential election to be called within sixty days. Natchaba was out of the country, returning on an Air France plane from Paris.<ref name="BBC News">{{cite news | title = Togo: Africa's democratic test case | publisher = BBC News | date = 11 February 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4243477.stm | accessdate = 15 November 2011}}</ref>

The Togolese army, known as Forces Armées Togolaises (FAT), or [[Togolese Armed Forces]], closed the nation's borders, forcing the plane to land in nearby Benin. With an engineered power vacuum, the Parliament voted to remove the constitutional clause that would have required an election within sixty days, and declared that Eyadema's son, [[Faure Gnassingbé]], would inherit the presidency and hold office for the rest of his father's term.<ref name="BBC News"/> Faure was sworn in on 7 February 2005, despite international criticism of the succession.<ref>{{cite news | title = Togo leader sworn in amid protest | publisher = BBC News | date = 7 February 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4243629.stm | accessdate = 15 November 2011}}</ref>

The African Union described the takeover as a military [[coup d'état]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4241001.stm |title=Togo succession 'coup' denounced |publisher=BBC News |date=6 February 2005 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> International pressure came also from the [[United Nations]]. Within Togo, opposition to the takeover culminated in riots in which several hundred died. There were uprisings in many cities and towns, mainly located in the southern part of the country. In the town of [[Aného]] reports of a general civilian uprising followed by a large scale massacre by government troops went largely unreported. In response, Faure Gnassingbé agreed to hold [[Togo presidential election, 2005|elections]] and on 25 February, Gnassingbé resigned as president, but soon afterward accepted the nomination to run for the office in April.<ref name="Ebow Godwin">{{cite web |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/n/a/2005/02/25/international/i180735S60.DTL |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106033758/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2005%2F02%2F25%2Finternational%2Fi180735S60.DTL |archivedate=6 January 2006 |title=Togo Leader to Step Down, Seek Presidency |publisher=Associated Press (via SF Gate) |author=Godwin, Ebow |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 24 April 2005, Gnassingbé was elected President of Togo, receiving over 60% of the vote according to official results. His main rival in the race had been [[Emmanuel Bob-Akitani]] from the [[Union des Forces du Changement]] (UFC) or [[Union of Forces for Change]]. However, electoral fraud was suspected, due to a lack of European Union or other independent oversight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scidev.net/gateways/index.cfm?fuseaction=readitem&rgwid=4&item=Opinions&itemid=401&language=1 |title=Technological shutdowns as tools of oppression |publisher=SciDev.net |date=20 June 2005 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>  Parliament designated Deputy President, [[Bonfoh Abbass]], as interim president until the inauguration.<ref name="Ebow Godwin"/> On 3 May 2005, [[Faure Gnassingbé]] was sworn in as the new president and the European Union suspended aid to Togo in support of the opposition claims, unlike the African Union and the United States which declared the vote "reasonably fair." The Nigerian president and Chair of the AU, [[Olusẹgun Ọbasanjọ]], sought to negotiate between the incumbent government and the opposition to establish a coalition government, but rejected an AU Commission appointment of former [[Zambia]]n president, [[Kenneth Kaunda]], as special AU envoy to Togo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200506060694.html |title=Togo: African Union in Row Over Appointment of Special Envoy |accessdate=2005-11-27 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926213044/http://allafrica.com/stories/200506060694.html |archivedate=26 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}.

AllAfrica.com</ref> In June, President Gnassingbé named opposition leader [[Edem Kodjo]] as the prime minister.

In October 2007, after several postponements, elections were held under proportional representation. This allowed the less populated north to seat as many MPs as the more populated south. The president-backed party [[Rally of the Togolese People]] (RPT) won outright majority with the UFC coming second and the other parties claiming inconsequential representation. Again vote rigging accusations were leveled at the RPT supported by the civil and military security apparatus. Despite the presence of an EU observer mission, canceled ballots and illegal voting took place, the majority of which in RPT strongholds. The election was declared fair by the international community and praised as a model with little intimidation and few violent acts for the first time since a multiparty system was reinstated. On 3 December 2007 [[Komlan Mally]] of the RPT was appointed to prime minister succeeding Agboyibor. However, on 5 September 2008, after only 10 months in office, Mally resigned as prime minister of Togo.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Regions of Togo|Prefectures of Togo}}
{{stack|{{Regions of Togo Image Map}}}}
Togo is divided into five regions, which are subdivided in turn into 30 [[prefecture]]s. From north to south the regions are [[Savanes Region, Togo|Savanes]], [[Kara Region|Kara]], [[Centrale Region, Togo|Centrale]], [[Plateaux Region, Togo|Plateaux]] and [[Maritime Region|Maritime]].

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Togo}}

Although '''Togo's foreign policy''' is nonaligned, it has strong historical and cultural ties with western Europe, especially France and Germany. Togo recognizes the People's Republic of China, [[North Korea]], and [[Cuba]]. It re-established relations with Israel in 1987.

Togo pursues an active foreign policy and participates in many international organizations. It is particularly active in [[West Africa]]n regional affairs and in the [[African Union]]. Relations between Togo and neighboring states are generally good.

=== Military ===
{{Main|Military of Togo}}

The military of Togo, in French '''FAT''' (Forces armées togolaises, "Togolese armed forces"), consists of the army, navy, air force, and [[gendarmerie]]. Total military expenditures during the [[fiscal year]] of 2005 totaled 1.6% of the country's [[GDP]].<ref name="cia"/> Military bases exist in [[Lomé]], Temedja, [[Kara, Togo|Kara]], [[Niamtougou]], and [[Dapaong]].<ref name="fat_organisation">{{cite web|url=http://forcesarmees.tg/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=33|title=Organisation des Forces Armées|publisher=www.forcesarmees.tg|accessdate=15 April 2011|date=}}</ref> The current Chief of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]] is Brigadier General Titikpina Atcha Mohamed, who took office on 19 May 2009.<ref name="fat_tetedefat">{{cite web|url=http://forcesarmees.tg/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=100|title=Un Nouveau Chef à la Tête des FAT|publisher=www.forcesarmees.tg|accessdate=16 April 2011|date=}}</ref> The air force is equipped with [[Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet|Alpha jets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=27460%3Atogolese-air-force-acquires-cn235&catid=35%3AAerospace&Itemid=107|title=Togolese Air Force acquires CN235|publisher=defenceweb.co.za|accessdate=5 July 2015|date=29 August 2012}}</ref>

=== Human Rights Record ===
{{Main|Human rights in Togo}}
Togo was labeled "Not Free" by [[Freedom House]] from 1972 to 1998, and again from 2002 to 2006, and has been categorized as "Partly Free" from 1999 to 2001 and again from 2007 to the present (according to the government officials). It has very serious and longstanding human-rights problems. According to a [[United States State Department|U.S. State Department]] report based on conditions in 2010, these include "security force use of excessive force, including [[torture]], which resulted in deaths and injuries; official impunity; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrests and detention; lengthy pretrial detention; executive influence over the judiciary; infringement of citizens' privacy rights; restrictions on [[freedom of the press|freedoms of press]], [[Freedom of Assembly|assembly]], and movement; official corruption; discrimination and violence against women; child abuse, including female genital mutilation (FGM), and sexual exploitation of children; regional and ethnic discrimination; trafficking in persons, especially women and children; societal discrimination against persons with disabilities; official and societal discrimination against homosexual persons; societal discrimination against persons with [[Human immunodeficiency virus|HIV]]; and forced labor, including by children."<ref name="2010 Human Rights Report: Togo">{{cite web|title=2010 Human Rights Report: Togo|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/af/154374.htm|work=US Department of State|accessdate=January 11, 2013}}</ref>

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Togo}}
{{see also|List of companies based in Togo}}
[[File:Togo Export Treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Togo's product exports in 28 color-coded categories]]

Togo is among the smallest countries in [[Africa]], and enjoys one of the highest standards of living on the continent owing to its valuable [[phosphate]] deposits and a well-developed export sector based on agricultural products such as [[coffee]]; [[cocoa bean]]; and [[peanut]]s (groundnuts), which together generate roughly 30% of export earnings.  Cotton is the most important cash crop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefactfile.org/togo-facts/|title=The Fact File|website=factfile.org|accessdate=2018-08-06}}</ref> The fertile land occupies 11.3% of the country, most of which is developed. Major crops are [[cassava]], [[jasmine rice]], [[corn]] and [[millet]]. Other important sectors are [[brewery]] and the [[textile]] industry. A permanent problem is the lack of [[electricity]], because the country is able to produce only about a third of its consumption, the rest is covered by imports from [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]]. Low market prices for Togo's major export commodities, however, coupled with the volatile political situation of the 1990s and early 2000s, had a negative effect on the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britannica.com/place/Togo#toc55354|title=Britannica|website=Britannica.org|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref>

Togo is one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]]; the economic situation is still precarious. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government's decade-long efforts, supported by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), to carry out economic reforms, to encourage investment, and to create the balance between income and consumption has stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrank the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity.

Togo imports [[machinery]], equipment, [[petroleum]] products, and [[food]]. Main import partners are [[France]] (21.1%), the [[Netherlands]] (12.1%), [[Côte d'Ivoire]] (5.9%), [[Germany]] (4.6%), [[Italy]] (4.4%), [[South Africa]] (4.3%) and [[China]] (4.1%). The main exports are [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]], re-export of goods, [[phosphates]] and [[cotton]]. Major export partners are [[Burkina Faso]] (16.6%), [[China]] (15.4%), the [[Netherlands]] (13%), [[Benin]] (9.6%) and [[Mali]] (7.4%).

In terms of structural reforms, Togo has made progress in the [[liberalization]] of the economy, namely in the fields of [[trade]] and port activities. However, the privatization program of the cotton sector, [[telecommunications]] and water supply has stalled. The country currently has no debt due to financial assistance from the outside while Togo is likely among the most beneficiary countries under the Initiative help in [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]].

12 January 1994 devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. Progress depends on increased openness in government financial operations (to accommodate increased social service outlays) and possible downsizing of the [[armed forces]], on which the regime has depended to stay in place. Lack of aid, along with depressed cocoa prices, generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with growth resuming in 1999. Togo is a member of the [[Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]] (OHADA).<ref name="ohada.com">

=== Agriculture ===
[[Agriculture]] is the backbone of the economy, although it is struggling with a chronic shortage of funds for the purchase of [[irrigation]] equipment and [[fertilizers]], which has significantly reduced agricultural output. Agriculture generated 28.2% of [[GDP]] in 2012 and employed 49% of the working population in 2010. The country is essentially [[self-sufficient]] in food production. [[Livestock]] production is dominated by [[cattle breeding]].<ref name="cia.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/to.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=Cia.gov|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Getting Togo’s Agriculture Back on Track, and Lifting Rural Families Out of Poverty Along the Way|author=Joelle Businger|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/nasikiliza/getting-togos-agriculture-back-on-track-and-lifting-rural-families-out-of-poverty-along-the-way}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Mining ===
[[Mining]] generated about 33.9% of GDP in 2012 and employed 12% of the population in 2010. Togo has the fourth largest [[phosphate]] deposits in the world. Their production is 2.1 million tons per year. Since the mid-90s, however, there has been a decline in the mining industry and government will need to invest heavily to sustain it. The mining industry is facing difficulties due to falling phosphate prices on world markets and increasing foreign competition. There are also reserves of [[limestone]], [[marble]] and [[salt]]. 

Industry provides only 20.4% of Togo's national income, because it consists only of a few light industries and builders. Large reserves of limestone allows Togo to produce [[cement]].<ref name="cia.gov"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Togo|title=Togo {{!}} Location, History, Population, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-20}}</ref>

The November 2010 census gave Togo a population of 6,191,155, more than double the total counted in the last census. That census, taken in 1981, showed the nation had a population of 2,719,567. The capital and largest city, Lomé, grew from 375,499 in 1981 to 837,437 in 2010. When the urban population of surrounding Golfe prefecture is added, the Lomé Agglomeration contained 1,477,660 residents in 2010.<ref name="ReferenceA">[RGPH4 Recensement Général de la Population 2010].

Direction Générale de la Statistique et de la Comptabilité Nationale</ref>

Other cities in Togo according to the new census were Sokodé (95,070), Kara (94,878), Kpalimé (75,084), Atakpamé (69,261), Dapaong (58,071) and Tsévié (54,474). With an estimated population of {{UN_Population|Togo}} ({{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}), Togo is the 107th largest country by population. Most of the population (65%) live in rural villages dedicated to agriculture or pastures. The population of Togo shows a strong growth: from 1961 (the year after independence) to 2003 it quintupled.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="Données de Recensement"/>

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:Togo-benin 1985-079 hg.jpg|thumb|People of Togo in the 1980s]]
In Togo, there are about 40 different ethnic groups, the most numerous of which are the [[Ewe people|Ewe]] in the south who make up 32% of the population. Along the southern coastline they account for 21% of the population. Also found are [[Tem language|Kotokoli or Tem]] and [[Tchamba]] in the center and the [[Kabye people]] in the north (22%). The [[Ouatchi]]s are 14% of the population. Sometimes the Ewes and Ouatchis are considered the same, but the French who studied both groups considered them different people.<ref>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of world geography |author1=Khan, M.

According to a 2012 US government religious freedoms report, in 2004 the University of Lomé estimated that 33% of the population are traditional animists, 28% are Roman Catholic, 14% are Sunni Muslim, 10% are Protestant and another 10% belonged to other Christian denominations. The remaining 5% were reported to include persons not affiliated with any religious group. The report also noted that many Christians and Muslims continue to perform indigenous religious practices.<ref name="Togo 2012">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/208418.pdf|title=Togo 2012 International Religious Freedom Report|publisher=|language=English|format=PDF|page=1|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>

The CIA World Factbook meanwhile states that 29% of the population are Christian, 20% are Muslim with 51% being followers of indigenous beliefs.<ref name="cia.gov"/>

[[Christianity]] began to spread from the middle of the 15th century, after the arrival of the Portuguese and [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] missionaries. Germans introduced [[Protestantism]] in the second half of the 19th century, when a hundred missionaries of the Bremen Missionary Society were sent to the coastal areas of Togo and Ghana. Togo's Protestants were known as "Brema," a corruption of the word "[[Bremen]]." After [[World War I]], German missionaries had to leave, which gave birth to the early autonomy of the [[Ewe Evangelical Church]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Decalo|first1=Samuel|title=Historical Dictionary of Togo|date=1996|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=|isbn=9780810830738|page=74}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of Togo}}
Togo is a [[multilingual]] country. According to Ethnologue, 39 distinct languages are spoken in the country, many of them by communities that number fewer than 100,000 members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=TG |website=Ethnologue.com|title=Languages of Togo|accessdate=31 October 2010}}</ref> Of the 39 languages, the sole [[official language]] is [[French language|French]]. Two spoken indigenous languages were designated politically as [[national language]]s in 1975: [[Ewe language|Ewé]] ({{lang-ee|Èʋegbe}}; {{lang-fr|Evé}}) and [[Kabiyé language|Kabiyé]]; they are also the two most widely spoken indigenous languages.

French is used in formal education, legislature, all forms of media, [[Administration (law)|administration]] and commerce. Ewe is a language of wider communication in the south. [[Tem language|Tem]] functions to a limited extent as a trade language in some northern towns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/TG|title=Togo|website=Ethnologue.com|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref> Officially, Ewe and Kabiye are "national languages", which in the Togolese context means languages that are promoted in formal education and used in the media.

Despite the colonial past of the country, the German language was not widely propagated until the French takeover of the colony during [[World War I]], and today it has no official status.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Togo|Music of Togo}}
[[File:Togo Taberma house 04.jpg|thumb|Traditional Taberma houses]]
Togo's culture reflects the influences of its many ethnic groups, the largest and most influential of which are the [[Ewe people|Ewe]], [[Mina people|Mina]], Tem, Tchamba and [[Kabre]].

Despite the influences of Christianity and Islam, over half of the people of Togo follow native [[animistic]] practices and beliefs.

Ewe statuary is characterized by its famous [[statuettes]] which illustrate the worship of the [[ibeji]]. Sculptures and hunting trophies were used rather than the more ubiquitous African masks. The wood-carvers of [[Kloto]] are famous for their "chains of marriage": two characters are connected by rings drawn from only one piece of wood.

The dyed fabric [[batik]]s of the artisanal center of Kloto represent stylized and colored scenes of ancient everyday life. The loincloths used in the ceremonies of the weavers of Assahoun are famous. Works of the painter Sokey Edorh are inspired by the immense arid extents, swept by the dry wind, and where the soil keeps the prints of the men and the animals. The plastics technician [[Paul Ahyi]] is internationally recognized today. He practiced the "[[zota]]", a kind of pyroengraving, and his monumental achievements decorate [[Lomé]].

The official Togolese drink is called [[:fr:Sodabi|sodabi]], a liquor that is created from the distillation of palm wine.

He successfully played in the German Bundesliga for more than 14 years and is a living legend for the German Clubs Borussia Mönchengladbach and MSV Duisburg, where they even perpetuated him in their stadium. Salou gained 38 caps for Togo during a nine-year span. He played 300 games and scored 69 goals in the German major league.
[[Emmanuel Adebayor]] is the most famous footballer for Togo, scoring 30 goals for the national team and 97 in the English Premier League.

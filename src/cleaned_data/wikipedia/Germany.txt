It borders [[Denmark]] to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]] to the south, [[France]] to the southwest, and [[Luxembourg]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]] to the west.

Germany includes 16 [[States of Germany|constituent states]], covers an area of {{convert|357386|km2|sqmi}},<ref name="Fläche"/> and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With 83 million inhabitants, it is the second most populous state of [[Europe]] after [[Russia]], the most populous state lying entirely in Europe, as well as the most populous [[member state of the European Union|member state]] of the [[European Union]]. Germany is a very [[decentralized]] country. Its [[capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities in Germany by population|largest]] metropolis is [[Berlin]], while [[Frankfurt]] serves as its financial capital and has the country's busiest [[Frankfurt Airport|airport]]. Germany's largest urban area is the [[Ruhr]], with its main centres of [[Dortmund]] and [[Essen]]. The country's other major cities are [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Düsseldorf]], [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]], [[Bremen]], [[Hannover]], and [[Nuremberg]].

Various [[Germanic tribes]] have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since [[classical antiquity]]. A region named [[Germania]] was [[Germania (book)|documented]] before 100&nbsp;AD. During the [[Migration Period]], the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>The Latin name ''Sacrum Imperium'' (Holy Empire) is documented as far back as 1157. The Latin name ''Sacrum Romanum Imperium'' (Holy Roman Empire) was first documented in 1254.

After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the [[German Confederation]] was formed in 1815. The [[German revolutions of 1848–49]] resulted in the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] establishing major democratic rights.

In 1871, Germany became a nation state when [[unification of Germany|most of the German states (most notably excluding Switzerland and Austria) unified]] into the [[Prussia]]n-dominated [[German Empire]]. After [[World War I]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–19|revolution of 1918–19]], the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Nazi seizure of power]] in 1933 led to the establishment of [[Nazi Germany|a dictatorship]], the annexation of [[Austria]], [[World War II]], and the [[Holocaust]]. After the [[end of World War II in Europe]] and a period of [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]], Austria was re-established as an independent country and two new German states were founded: [[West Germany]], formed from the American, British, and French occupation zones, and [[East Germany]], formed from the [[Soviet occupation zone]]. Following the [[Revolutions of 1989]] that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country [[German reunification|was reunified]] on [[German Unity Day|3 October 1990]].<ref name="SLyE6YJEn0C page 52">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ySLyE6YJEn0C&pg=PA52|title=The Lost German East|isbn=9781107020733|author1=Demshuk|first1=Andrew|date=30 April 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201215323/https://books.google.com/books?id=ySLyE6YJEn0C&pg=PA52|archivedate=1 December 2016}}</ref>

In 996 [[Pope Gregory V|Gregory V]] became the first German Pope, appointed by his cousin [[Otto III]], whom he shortly after crowned Holy Roman Emperor. The Holy Roman Empire absorbed northern Italy and [[Burgundy (historical region)|Burgundy]] under the reign of the [[Salian]] emperors (1024–1125), although the emperors lost power through the [[Investiture controversy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=McBrien, Richard|title=Lives of the Popes: The Pontiffs from St. Peter to Benedict XVI|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|page=138}}</ref>

In the 12th century, under the [[House of Hohenstaufen|Hohenstaufen]] emperors (1138–1254), German princes increased their influence further south and east into territories inhabited by [[Slavs]]; they encouraged [[History of German settlement in Central and Eastern Europe|German settlement]] in these areas, called the eastern settlement movement ''([[Ostsiedlung]])''. Members of the [[Hanseatic League]], which included mostly north German cities and towns, prospered in the expansion of trade.<ref>Fulbrook 1991, pp. 13–24.</ref> In the south, the Greater Ravensburg Trade Corporation (''Große Ravensburger Handelsgesellschaft'') served a similar function. The edict of the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]] issued in 1356 by Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] provided the basic constitutional structure of the Empire and codified the election of the emperor by seven [[prince-elector]]s who ruled some of the most powerful principalities and archbishoprics.<ref>Fulbrook 1991, p. 27.</ref>

Population declined in the first half of the 14th century, starting with the [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] in 1315, followed by the [[Black Death]] of 1348–50.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/black_death.html |title=The Great Famine (1315–1317) and the Black Death (1346–1351) |first=Lynn Harry |last=Nelson |publisher=University of Kansas |accessdate=19 March 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429072010/http://www.vlib.us/medieval/lectures/black_death.html |archivedate=29 April 2011  }}</ref> Despite the decline, however, German artists, engineers, and scientists developed a wide array of techniques similar to those used by the Italian artists and designers of the time who flourished in such merchant [[Italian city-states|city-states]] as [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] and [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]]. Artistic and cultural centres throughout the German states produced such artists as the Augsburg painters [[Hans Holbein the Elder|Hans Holbein]] and his [[Hans Holbein the Younger|son]], and [[Albrecht Dürer]]. [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced moveable-type [[printing]] to Europe, a development that laid the basis for the [[democratization of knowledge|spread of learning to the masses]].<ref>Eisenstein, Elizabeth.

In 1517, the [[Wittenberg]] priest [[Martin Luther]] nailed the ''[[Ninety-Five Theses]]'' to the church door, challenging the practice of selling of [[indulgence]]s. He was subsequently excommunicated in the papal bull ''[[Exsurge Domine]]'' in 1520, and his followers were condemned in the 1521 [[Diet of Worms]], which divided Western Christianity. In 1555, the [[Peace of Augsburg]] tolerated the "Evangelical" faith (now called [[Lutheranism]]) as an acceptable alternative to Catholicism, but also decreed that the faith of the prince was to be the faith of his subjects, a principle called ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''. The agreement at Augsburg failed to address other religious creed: for example, the [[Calvinism|Reformed faith]] was still considered a [[heresy]] and the principle did not address the possible conversion of an ecclesiastic ruler, such as happened in [[Electorate of Cologne]] in 1583. However, in practice Calvinists were given protection under the ''[[Augsburg Confession Variata]]'' modified upon request by [[Philip Melanchthon]].

In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire|territories]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Gagliardo, G|title=Reich and Nation, The Holy Roman Empire as Idea and Reality, 1763–1806|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1980|pages=12–13}}</ref> The elaborate legal system initiated by a series of [[Imperial Reform]]s (approximately 1450–1555) created the Imperial Estates and provided for considerable local autonomy among ecclesiastical, secular, and hereditary states, reflected in the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]. The [[House of Habsburg]] held the imperial crown from 1438 until the death of [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] in 1740. Having no male heirs, he had convinced the [[Prince-elector|Electors]] to retain Habsburg hegemony in the office of the emperor by agreeing to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]] of 1713. This was finally settled through the [[War of Austrian Succession]]; in the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], Charles VI's daughter [[Maria Theresa]] ruled the Empire as [[Queen consort|Empress Consort]] when her husband, [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], became Holy Roman Emperor. From 1740, the [[German dualism|dualism]] between the Austrian [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] dominated the German history.

In 1772, then again in 1793 and 1795, the two dominant German states of Prussia and Austria, along with the [[Russian Empire]], agreed to the [[Partitions of Poland]]; dividing among themselves the lands of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. As a result of the partitions, millions of Polish speaking inhabitants fell under the rule of the two German monarchies. However, the annexed territories though incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia and the Habsburg Realm, were not legally considered as a part of the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Robert |last1=Bideleux |first2=Ian |last2=Jeffries |title=A History of Eastern Europe: Crisis and Change |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |page=156}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Judy |last1=Batt |first2=Kataryna |last2=Wolczuk |title=Region, State and Identity in Central and Eastern Europe |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |page=153}}</ref> During the period of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], along with the arrival of the [[Napoleonic era]] and the subsequent [[Final Recess of the Reichsdeputation|final meeting of the Imperial Diet]], most of the secular [[Free Imperial Cities]] were annexed by dynastic territories; the ecclesiastical territories were secularised and annexed. In 1806 the ''Imperium'' was dissolved; many German states, particularly the [[Confederation of the Rhine|Rhineland states]], fell under the influence of France. Until 1815, France, Russia, Prussia and the Habsburgs (Austria) competed for hegemony in the German states during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref>Fulbrook 1991, p. 97.</ref>

=== German Confederation and Empire ===
{{Main|German Confederation|German Empire|German Colonial Empire}}
[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|A map showing the [[German Confederation]] (1815–1836) with its 39 member states.]]
Following the fall of [[Napoleon]], the [[Congress of Vienna]] (convened in 1814) founded the German Confederation (''Deutscher Bund''), a loose league of [[States of the German Confederation|39 sovereign states]]. The appointment of the [[Emperor of Austria]] as the permanent president of the Confederation reflected the Congress's failure to accept Prussia's rising influence among the German states, and acerbated the long-standing competition between the Hohenzollern and Habsburg interests. Disagreement within [[European Restoration|restoration]] politics partly led to the rise of [[Liberalism in Germany|liberal]] movements, followed by new measures of repression by Austrian statesman [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich]]. The ''[[Zollverein]]'', a tariff union, furthered economic unity in the German states.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Henderson |first=W. O. |title=The Zollverein |journal=History |date=January 1934 |volume=19 |issue=73 |pages=1–19 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-229X.1934.tb01791.x}}</ref>

[[nationalism|National]] and liberal ideals of the [[French Revolution]] gained increasing support among many, especially young, Germans. The [[Hambach Festival]] in May 1832 was a main event in support of [[German question|German unity]], freedom and democracy. In the light of a [[Revolutions of 1848|series of revolutionary movements in Europe]], which established a republic [[French Revolution of 1848|in France]], intellectuals and commoners started the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]]. King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]] was offered the title of Emperor, but with a loss of power; he rejected the crown and the proposed constitution, leading to a temporary setback for the movement.<ref name="state" />
[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|Foundation of the [[German Empire]] in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], 1871. [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] is at the centre in a white uniform.]]
King [[William I, German Emperor|William I]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] as the new [[Minister President of Prussia]] in 1862. Bismarck successfully concluded [[Second Schleswig War|war on Denmark]] in 1864, which promoted German over Danish interests in the Jutland peninsula. The subsequent (and decisive) Prussian victory in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866 enabled him to create the [[North German Confederation]] (''Norddeutscher Bund'') which excluded [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] from the federation's affairs. After the French defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the German princes proclaimed the founding of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], uniting all the scattered parts of Germany except Austria and the German-speaking parts of Switzerland. Prussia was the dominant constituent state of the new empire; the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] King of Prussia ruled as its concurrent Emperor, and Berlin became its capital.<ref name="state" />

In the {{lang|de|[[Gründerzeit]]}} period following the [[unification of Germany]], Bismarck's foreign policy as [[Chancellor of Germany]] under Emperor William I secured Germany's position as a great nation by forging alliances, isolating [[French Third Republic|France]] by diplomatic means, and avoiding war. Under [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]], Germany, like other European powers, took an [[New Imperialism|imperialistic]] course, leading to friction with neighbouring countries. Most alliances in which Germany had previously been involved were not renewed. This resulted in the creation of a [[Dual Alliance (1879)|dual alliance]] with the [[multinational state|multinational realm]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], promoting at least [[benevolent neutrality]] if not outright military support. Subsequently, the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] included Italy, completing a Central European geographic alliance that illustrated German, Austrian and Italian fears of incursions against them by France and/or Russia. Similarly, Britain, France and Russia also concluded alliances that would protect them against Habsburg interference with Russian interests in the Balkans or German interference against France.<ref>Fulbrook 1991, pp.&nbsp;135, 149.</ref>
[[File:Deutsches Reich 1871-1918.png|left|thumb|The [[German Empire]] (1871–1918), with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in blue]]
At the [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884, Germany claimed several [[List of former German colonies|colonies]] including [[German East Africa]], [[German South West Africa]], [[Togoland]], and [[Kamerun]].<ref>{{cite book |title=100 maps |year=2005 |publisher=Sterling Publishing |isbn=978-1-4027-2885-3 |editor=Black, John |page=202}}</ref> Later, Germany further expanded its [[German colonial empire|colonial empire]] to include [[German New Guinea]], [[German Micronesia]] and [[German Samoa]] in the Pacific, and [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Kiautschou Bay]] in China. In what became known as the "First Genocide of the Twentieth-Century", between 1904 and 1907, the German colonial government in South West Africa (present-day [[Namibia]]) ordered the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|annihilation of the local Herero and Namaqua peoples]], as a punitive measure for an uprising against German colonial rule. In total, around 100,000 people—80% of the [[Herero people|Herero]] and 50% of the [[Nama people|Namaqua]]—perished from imprisonment in [[concentration camps]], where the majority died of disease, abuse, and exhaustion, or from dehydration and starvation in the countryside after being deprived of food and water.<ref>Olusoga, David and Erichsen, Casper W (2010).

Territories east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] transferred to Poland and the Soviet Union under the terms of the [[Potsdam Conference]].]]

After [[Nazi Germany]] surrendered, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] partitioned Berlin and Germany's remaining territory into four military occupation zones. The western sectors, controlled by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, were merged on 23 May 1949 to form the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (''Bundesrepublik Deutschland''); on 7 October 1949, the Soviet Zone became the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (''Deutsche Demokratische Republik''). They were informally known as [[West Germany]] and [[East Germany]]. East Germany selected [[East Berlin]] as its capital, while West Germany chose [[Bonn]] as a provisional capital, to emphasise its stance that the two-state solution was an artificial and temporary status quo.<ref>{{cite book | last = Wise | first = Michael Z. | title = Capital dilemma: Germany's search for a new architecture of democracy| year = 1998| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | isbn =978-1-56898-134-5 | page = 23}}</ref>

West Germany was established as a federal parliamentary republic with a "[[social market economy]]".

Tensions between East and West Germany were reduced in the early 1970s by Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s {{lang|de|[[Ostpolitik]]}}. In summer 1989, Hungary decided to dismantle the [[Iron Curtain]] and open the borders, causing the emigration of thousands of [[East Germans]] to West Germany via Hungary. This had devastating effects on the GDR, where regular [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations]] received increasing support. The East German authorities eased the border restrictions, allowing East German citizens to travel to the West; originally intended to help retain East Germany as a state, the opening of the border actually led to an acceleration of the ''Wende'' reform process. This culminated in the ''[[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|Two Plus Four Treaty]]'' a year later on 12 September 1990, under which the four occupying powers renounced their rights under the [[German Instrument of Surrender|Instrument of Surrender]], and Germany regained full sovereignty. This permitted [[German reunification]] on 3 October 1990, with the accession of the [[New states of Germany|five re-established states]] of the former GDR.<ref name="state" />

{{Main|Geography of Germany}}
[[File:Deutschland topo.jpg|thumb|upright|Physical map of Germany]]

Germany is in [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]], with [[Denmark]] bordering to the north, [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] to the east, [[Austria]] to the southeast, [[Switzerland]] to the south-southwest, France, [[Luxembourg]] and Belgium lie to the west, and the [[Netherlands]] to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes [[47th parallel north|47°]] and [[55th parallel north|55° N]] and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[16th meridian east|16° E]]. Germany is also bordered by the North Sea and, at the north-northeast, by the Baltic Sea. With Switzerland and Austria, Germany also shares a border on the fresh-water [[Lake Constance]], the third largest lake in Central Europe.<ref>[http://library.mcmaster.ca/maps/fc1999.htm Image #432, Flying Camera Satellite Images 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015142609/http://library.mcmaster.ca/maps/fc1999.htm |date=15 October 2015 }}, Lloyd Reeds Map Collection, McMaster University Library.</ref> German territory covers {{convert|357021|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, consisting of {{convert|349223|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of land and {{convert|7798|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of water.

Elevation ranges from the mountains of the [[Alps]] (highest point: the [[Zugspitze]] at {{convert|2962|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) in the south to the shores of the [[North Sea]] (''Nordsee'') in the northwest and the [[Baltic Sea]] (''Ostsee'') in the northeast. The forested uplands of central Germany and the lowlands of northern Germany (lowest point: [[Wilstermarsch]] at {{convert|3.54|m|ft|1|disp=or}} below sea level) are traversed by such major rivers as the Rhine, [[Danube]] and [[Elbe]].

[[File:Mittelrhein Burg Katz.jpg|thumb|right|Rhine valley in summer at [[Lorelei]].]]
Most of Germany has a [[temperate]] seasonal climate dominated by humid westerly winds. The country is situated in between the [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] Western European and the [[Continental climate|continental]] Eastern European climate. The climate is moderated by the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]], the northern extension of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This warmer water affects the areas bordering the North Sea; consequently in the northwest and the north the climate is oceanic. Germany gets an average of {{convert|789|mm|0|abbr=on}} of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] per year; there is no consistent dry season. Winters are cool and summers tend to be warm: temperatures can exceed {{convert|30|°C|°F|lk=on}}.<ref name="climate">{{cite web|title=Climate in Germany|url=http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm|publisher=GermanCulture|accessdate=26 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205082859/http://www.germanculture.com.ua/library/facts/bl_climate.htm|archivedate=5 February 2016}}</ref>

The east has a more continental climate: winters can be very cold and summers very warm, and longer dry periods can occur. Central and southern Germany are transition regions which vary from moderately oceanic to continental. In addition to the maritime and continental climates that predominate over most of the country, the Alpine regions in the extreme south and, to a lesser degree, some areas of the Central German Uplands have a mountain climate, with lower temperatures and more precipitation.<ref name="climate" />

Though the German climate is rarely extreme, there are occasional spikes of cold or heat. Winter temperatures can sometimes drop to two-digit negative temperatures for a few days in a row. Conversely, summer can see periods of very high temperatures for a week or two. The recorded extremes are a maximum of {{convert|40.3|°C|°F|lk=on}} (July 2015, in [[Kitzingen]]), and a minimum of {{convert|-37.8|°C|°F|lk=on}} (February 1929, in [[Pfaffenhofen an der Ilm]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Wetterrekorde Deutschland |url=https://www.wetterdienst.de/Klima/Wetterrekorde/Deutschland/Temperatur/Max/ |publisher=wetterdienst.de |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref>

Plants and animals include those generally common to Central Europe. [[Beeches]], [[oak]]s, and other [[deciduous]] trees constitute one-third of the forests; [[conifers]] are increasing as a result of [[reforestation]]. [[Spruce]] and [[fir]] trees predominate in the upper mountains, while [[pine]] and [[larch]] are found in sandy soil. There are many species of [[fern]]s, [[flowers]], [[fungi]], and [[mosses]]. Wild animals include [[Central European red deer|roe deer]], [[Central European boar|wild boar]], [[mouflon]] (a subspecies of wild sheep), [[Red fox|fox]], [[European badger|badger]], [[European hare|hare]], and small numbers of the [[Eurasian beaver]].<ref>{{cite book| last=Bekker |first=Henk |title=Adventure Guide Germany |year=2005 |publisher=Hunter |isbn =978-1-58843-503-3 |page=14}}</ref> The [[Prussian blue|blue]] [[cornflower]] was once a German [[floral emblem|national symbol]].<ref>{{cite book| author = Marcel Cleene|author2=Marie Claire Lejeune| title = Compendium of Symbolic and Ritual Plants in Europe: Herbs| url = https://books.google.com/?id=g5GBAAAAMAAJ| year = 2002| publisher = Man & Culture| quote=The Cornflower was once the floral emblem of Germany (hence the German common name Kaiserblume).}}</ref>

Germany is a [[federal republic|federal]], [[parliamentary democratic|parliamentary]], [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. The German political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1949 constitution known as the ''[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Grundgesetz]]'' (Basic Law). Amendments generally require a two-thirds majority of both the [[Bundestag]] and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]; the fundamental principles of the constitution, as expressed in the articles guaranteeing human dignity, the separation of powers, the federal structure, and the [[rule of law]] are valid in perpetuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf|title=Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|date=October 2010|website=Deutscher Bundestag|publisher=Btg-bestellservice|accessdate=14 April 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619180331/https://www.btg-bestellservice.de/pdf/80201000.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2017}}</ref>

The [[President of Germany|president]], [[Frank-Walter Steinmeier]] (19 March 2017–present), is the [[head of state]] and invested primarily with representative responsibilities and powers. He is elected by the ''[[Bundesversammlung (Germany)|Bundesversammlung]]'' (federal convention), an institution consisting of the members of the ''Bundestag'' and an equal number of state delegates. The second-highest official in the [[German order of precedence]] is the ''Bundestagspräsident'' ([[President of the Bundestag|President of the ''Bundestag'']]), who is elected by the ''Bundestag'' and responsible for overseeing the daily sessions of the body. The third-highest official and the [[head of government]] is the Chancellor, who is appointed by the ''Bundespräsident'' after being elected by the ''Bundestag''.<ref name="state" />

[[File:Political System of Germany.svg|thumb|left|The political system of Germany]]

The Chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]] (22 November 2005–present), is the head of government and exercises [[executive (government)|executive power]] through their [[Cabinet of Germany|Cabinet]], similar to the role of a [[Prime Minister]] in other parliamentary democracies. Federal [[legislative power]] is vested in the parliament consisting of the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Federal Diet) and ''[[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]]'' (Federal Council), which together form the legislative body. The ''Bundestag'' is elected through [[direct election]]s, by [[proportional representation]] ([[mixed member proportional representation|mixed-member]]).<ref name="CIA" /> The members of the ''Bundesrat'' represent the governments of the sixteen federated states and are members of the state cabinets.<ref name="state" />

Since 1949, the party system has been dominated by the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]. So far every chancellor has been a member of one of these parties. However, the smaller liberal [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]] (in parliament from 1949 to 2013 and again since 2017) and the [[Alliance '90/The Greens]] (in parliament since 1983) have also played important roles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm|title=Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress|accessdate=26 March 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010247/http://countrystudies.us/germany/159.htm|archivedate=30 April 2011}}</ref> Since 2005, the left-wing populist party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]], formed through the merger of two former parties, has been a staple in the German ''Bundestag'' though they have never been part of the federal government. In the [[German federal election, 2017]], the right-wing populist [[Alternative for Germany]] gained enough votes to attain representation in the parliament for the first time.

The role of the ''Bundeswehr'' is described in the [[Constitution of Germany]] as defensive only.

Until 2011, [[Conscription in Germany|military service]] was compulsory for men at age 18, and conscripts served six-month tours of duty; [[conscientious objectors]] could instead opt for an equal length of ''[[Zivildienst]]'' (civilian service), or a six-year commitment to (voluntary) emergency services like a [[Volunteer fire department|fire department]] or the [[German Red Cross|Red Cross]].

In the 1960s and 1970s, the German governments invited "guest workers" ([[Gastarbeiter]]) to migrate to Germany for work in the German industries. Many companies preferred to keep these workers employed in Germany after they had trained them and Germany's immigrant population has steadily increased.<ref name="File 2013" />

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Germany}}
Upon its establishment in 1871, Germany was about two-thirds [[Protestant]]{{efn|German Protestantism has been overwhelmingly a mixture of Lutheran, Reformed (i.e. Calvinist), and United (Lutheran & Reformed/Calvinist) churches, with Baptists, Pentecostals, Methodists, and various other Protestants being only a recent development.}} and one-third [[Roman Catholic]], with a notable [[Jews|Jewish]] minority. Other faiths existed in the state, but never achieved a demographic significance and cultural impact of these three confessions. Germany lost nearly all of its Jewish minority during the [[Holocaust]]. Religious makeup changed gradually in the decades following 1945, with West Germany becoming more religiously diversified through [[Immigration to Germany|immigration]] and East Germany becoming overwhelmingly irreligious through [[State atheism|state policies]]. It continues to diversify after the German reunification in 1990, with an accompanying substantial decline in religiosity throughout all of Germany and a contrasting increase of [[evangelical Protestants]] and [[Muslims]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnocWI0_fywC&pg=PA173|title=Germany: A Country Study|author=Solsten, Eric|isbn=978-0-7881-8179-5|year=1999|publisher=Diane Publishing|pages=173–175|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202033637/https://books.google.com/books?id=vnocWI0_fywC&pg=PA173|archivedate=2 December 2016}}</ref>

Geographically, Protestantism is concentrated in the northern, central and eastern parts of the country.{{efn|Lutheranism is found mostly throughout northern Germany, [[Württemberg]] and parts of [[Franconia]]; Calvinism in the extreme northwest and [[Lippe]], while the United churches throughout the remainder of Germany.}} These are mostly members of the EKD, which encompasses [[Lutheran]], [[Reformed]] and [[United and uniting churches|administrative or confessional unions of both traditions]] dating back to the [[Prussian Union of churches|Prussian Union]] of 1817.{{efn|Although the first such union between Lutheran and Calvinist Protestants happened in August 1817 in the [[Duchy of Nassau]] (a confessional union, ''see [[Unionskirche, Idstein]]''); that is before the Prussian Union of September 1817.

German [[classical music era|classical music]] includes works by some of the world's most well-known composers. [[Dieterich Buxtehude]] composed oratorios for organ, which influenced the later work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel|Georg Friedrich Händel]]; these men were influential composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]]. During his tenure as violinist and teacher at the Salzburg cathedral, Augsburg-born composer [[Leopold Mozart]] mentored one of the most noted musicians of all time: [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] was a crucial figure in the transition between the Classical and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] eras. [[Carl Maria von Weber]] and [[Felix Mendelssohn]] were important in the early Romantic period. [[Robert Schumann]] and [[Johannes Brahms]] composed in the Romantic idiom. [[Richard Wagner]] was known for his operas. [[Richard Strauss]] was a leading composer of the late Romantic and early [[20th-century classical music|modern]] eras.

German painters have influenced [[Art of Europe|western art]].

Several German art groups formed in the 20th century, such as the [[November Group (German)|November Group]] or [[Die Brücke]] (The Bridge) and [[Der Blaue Reiter]] (The Blue Rider), by the Russian-born [[Wassily Kandinsky]], influenced the development of [[Expressionism]] in Munich and Berlin. The [[New Objectivity]] arose as a counter-style to it during the [[Weimar Republic]]. Post-World War II art trends in Germany can broadly be divided into [[Neo-expressionism]], [[performance art]] and [[Conceptual art|Conceptualism]]. Especially notable neo-expressionists include [[Georg Baselitz]], [[Anselm Kiefer]], [[Jörg Immendorff]], [[A. R. Penck]], [[Markus Lüpertz]], [[Peter Robert Keil]] and [[Rainer Fetting]]. Other notable artists who work with traditional media or figurative imagery include [[Martin Kippenberger]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Sigmar Polke]], and [[Neo Rauch]]. Leading German conceptual artists include or included [[Bernd and Hilla Becher]], [[Hanne Darboven]], [[Hans-Peter Feldmann]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Joseph Beuys]], [[HA Schult]], [[Aris Kalaizis]], [[Neo Rauch]] ([[New Leipzig School]]) and [[Andreas Gursky]] (photography).

Architectural contributions from Germany include the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian architecture|Ottonian styles]], which were precursors of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]]. [[Brick Gothic]] is a distinctive medieval style that evolved in Germany. Also in [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] art, regional and typically German elements evolved (e.g. [[Weser Renaissance]] and ''[[Dresden]] Baroque''). Among many renowned Baroque masters were [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann|Pöppelmann]], [[Johann Balthasar Neumann|Balthasar Neumann]], [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff|Knobelsdorff]] and the [[Asam brothers]]. The [[Wessobrunner School]] exerted a decisive influence on, and at times even dominated, the art of stucco in southern Germany in the 18th century. The [[Upper Swabian Baroque Route]] offers a baroque-themed tourist route that highlights the contributions of such artists and craftsmen as the sculptor and plasterer [[Johann Michael Feuchtmayer]], one of the foremost members of the [[Feuchtmayer]] family and the brothers [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]].<ref>Jan Koppmann, "Das Zeitalter des Barock", in M.

When industrialisation spread across Europe, [[Classicism]] and a distinctive style of [[Historicism (art)|historism]] developed in Germany, sometimes referred to as ''[[Gründerzeit]] style'', due to the economical boom years at the end of the 19th century. Regional historicist styles include the ''[[Hanover school of architecture|Hanover School]]'', ''[[Nuremberg]] Style'' and Dresden's ''[[Gottfried Semper|Semper]]-[[Georg Hermann Nicolai|Nicolai]] School''. Among the most famous of German buildings, the [[Schloss Neuschwanstein]] represents [[Romanesque Revival]]. Notable sub-styles that evolved since the 18th century are the [[List of spa towns in Germany|German spa]] and [[List of seaside resorts in Germany|seaside resort]] architecture. German artists, writers and gallerists like [[Siegfried Bing]], [[Georg Hirth]] and [[Bruno Möhring]] also contributed to the development of [[Art Nouveau]] at the turn of the 20th century, known as ''Jugendstil'' in German.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm |title=Art Nouveau&nbsp;– Art Nouveau Art |publisher=Huntfor.com |accessdate=25 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130222070337/http://www.huntfor.com/arthistory/c19th/artnouveau.htm |archivedate=22 February 2013  }}</ref>

[[Expressionist architecture]] developed in the 1910s in Germany and influenced [[Art Deco]] and other modern styles, with e.g. [[Johann Friedrich Höger|Fritz Höger]], [[Erich Mendelsohn]], [[Dominikus Böhm]], and [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] being influential architects. Germany was particularly important in the early [[modern architecture|modernist movement]]: it is the home of [[Deutscher Werkbund|Werkbund]] initiated by [[Hermann Muthesius]] ([[New Objectivity (architecture)|New Objectivity]]), and of the [[Bauhaus]] movement founded by [[Walter Gropius]]. Consequently, Germany is often considered the cradle of modern architecture and design. [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]] became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade [[skyscraper]].<ref>{{cite book|year=2006|title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=880|isbn=978-0-19-860678-9}}</ref> Renowned contemporary [[List of German architects|architects]] and offices include [[Hans Kollhoff]], [[Sergei Enwerowitsch Tschoban|Sergei Tchoban]], [[Christoph Kohl (architect)|KK Architekten]], [[Helmut Jahn]], [[Behnisch Architekten|Behnisch]], [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|GMP]], [[Ole Scheeren]], [[Jürgen Mayer (architect)|J.

{{Main|Cinema of Germany}}

[[Cinema of Germany|German cinema]] has made major technical and artistic contributions to film. The first works of the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky Brothers]] were shown to an audience in 1895. The renowned [[Babelsberg Studio]] in [[Potsdam]] was established in 1912, thus being the first large-scale film studio in the world (today it is Europe's second largest studio after [[Cinecittà]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cinecitta.com/IT/it-it/cms/132/studios.aspx|title=Studios|last=SemiColonWeb|website=www.cinecitta.com}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110818094006/http://www.studiobabelsberg.com/service/filmstudios-ateliers/neue-film-1/ Studio Babelsberg] – ''Mit der Erschließung des direkt in der Nachbarschaft befindlichen Filmgeländes mit den Studios Neue Film 1 und Neue Film 2 konnte Studio Babelsberg seine Studiokapazitäten verdoppeln und verfügt so über Europas größten zusammenhängenden Studiokomplex.'', retrieved 3 December 2013 (German)</ref> Other early and still active studios include [[UFA GmbH|UFA]] and [[Bavaria Film]].

[[File:Filmstudio Babelsberg Eingang.jpg|thumb|[[Babelsberg Studio]] near Berlin, the world's first large-scale film studio]]

After 1945, many of the films of the immediate post-war period can be characterised as ''[[Rubble film|Trümmerfilm]]'' (rubble film). Such films included [[Wolfgang Staudte]]'s ''[[Die Mörder sind unter uns]] (The Murderers are among us, 1946)'' and ''[[Somewhere in Berlin|Irgendwo in Berlin]]'' (Somewhere in Berlin, 1946) by [[Werner Krien]]. The state-owned East German film studio [[DEFA (film studio)|DEFA]] produced notable films including ''[[Marriage in the Shadows|Ehe im Schatten]]'' (Marriage in the Shadows) by [[Kurt Maetzig]] (1947), ''[[Der Untertan (film)|Der Untertan]]'' (1951); ''[[Die Geschichte vom kleinen Muck]]'' (The Story of Little Muck, 1953), [[Konrad Wolf]]'s ''[[Divided Heaven (film)|Der geteilte Himmel]] (Divided Heaven)'' (1964) and [[Frank Beyer]]'s ''[[Jacob the Liar (1975 film)|Jacob the Liar]]'' (1975). The defining film genre in West Germany of the 1950s was arguably the ''[[Heimatfilm]]'' ("homeland film"); these films depicted the beauty of the land and the moral integrity of the people living in it.<ref>Stephen Brockmann, ''A Critical History of German Film'', Camden House, 2010, p. 286. {{ISBN|1571134689}}</ref> Characteristic for the films of the 1960s were genre films including [[Films based on works by Edgar Wallace#German adaptations|Edgar Wallace]] and [[Karl May film adaptations|Karl May]] adaptations. One of the most successful German movie series of the 1970s included the [[sex report film|sex reports]] called ''[[Schulmädchen-Report]]'' (Schoolgirl Report). During the 1970s and 1980s, [[New German Cinema]] directors such as [[Volker Schlöndorff]], [[Werner Herzog]], [[Wim Wenders]], and [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] brought West German auteur cinema to critical acclaim.

Among the box office hits, there were films such as ''[[Chariots of the Gods (film)|Chariots of the Gods]]'' (1970), ''[[Das Boot]]'' (The Boat, 1981), ''[[The NeverEnding Story (film)|The Never Ending Story]]'' (1984), ''[[Otto – Der Film|Otto – The Movie]]'' (1985), ''[[Run Lola Run]]'' (1998), ''[[Der Schuh des Manitu|Manitou's Shoe]]'' (2001), the ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' series (2002–2016), ''[[Good Bye, Lenin!]]'' (2003), ''[[Head-On (film)|Head On]]'' (2004), ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' (2009), ''[[Animals United]]'' (2010), and ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (2012). The [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] ("Oscar") went to the German production ''[[The Tin Drum (film)|Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum)]]'' in 1979, to ''[[Nowhere in Africa|Nirgendwo in Afrika (Nowhere in Africa)]]'' in 2002, and to ''[[The Lives of Others|Das Leben der Anderen (The Lives of Others)]]'' in 2007.

'''Singapore''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Singapore.ogg|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|(|g|)|ə|p|ɔːr}}), officially the '''Republic of Singapore''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]: {{Native name|ms|Republik Singapura|paren=omit}}; [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: {{Native name|zh|新加坡共和国|italics=off|paren=omit}}; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: {{Native name|ta|சிங்கப்பூர் குடியரசு|italics=off|paren=omit}}), is an  [[island country|island]] [[city-state]] in [[Southeast Asia]]. It lies one degree ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], at the southern tip of the [[Malay Peninsula]], with [[Indonesia]]'s [[Riau Islands]] to the south and [[Peninsular Malaysia]] to the north. Singapore's territory consists of one [[Pulau Ujong|main island]] along with [[List of islands of Singapore|62 other islets]]. Since independence, extensive [[land reclamation]] has increased its total size by 23% ({{Convert|130|km2|disp=or}}). The country is known for its transition from a [[Developing country|developing]] to a [[Developed country|developed]] one in a single generation under the leadership of its founder [[Lee Kuan Yew]].<ref>{{cite news |title=His fighting spirit helped S'pore leap from Third World to First |url= https://www.todayonline.com/rememberinglky/his-fighting-spirit-helped-spore-leap-third-world-first |work=Today |location= Singapore |date=26 March 2015}}</ref>

In 1819, Sir [[Stamford Raffles]] founded [[Founding of modern Singapore|colonial Singapore]] as a trading post of the [[British East India Company]]. After the company's [[Sepoy Rebellion of 1857|collapse]] in 1858, the islands were ceded to the [[British Raj]] as a crown colony. During the [[Second World War]], Singapore was [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|occupied by Japan]]. It gained independence from the British Empire in 1963 by joining [[Malaysia]] along with other former British territories ([[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]]), but separated two years later over [[Singapore in Malaysia|ideological differences]], becoming a sovereign nation in 1965. After early years of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1965 to 1979|turbulence]] and despite lacking natural resources and a [[hinterland]], the nation developed rapidly as an [[Asian Tiger]] economy, based on external trade and its [[workforce]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Names of Singapore}}
The English name of Singapore is an [[anglicisation]] of the native [[Malay language|Malay]] name for the country, ''{{lang|ms|Singapura}}'', which was in turn derived from [[Sanskrit]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411060419/http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 April 2001 |title=Singapore |publisher=bartleby.com |accessdate=14 April 2006  }}</ref> ([[wikt:सिंहपुर|सिंहपुर]], <small>[[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]</small>: ''Siṃhapura''; ''siṃha'' is "lion", ''pura'' is "town" or "city"), hence the customary reference to the nation as the ''Lion City'', and its inclusion in many of the nation's symbols (e.g., its coat of arms, Merlion emblem). However, it is unlikely that lions ever lived on the island; [[Sang Nila Utama]], the [[Srivijaya]]n prince said to have founded and named the island ''Singapura'', perhaps saw a [[Malayan tiger]]. There are however other suggestions for the origin of the name and scholars do not believe that the origin of the name is firmly established.<ref name="turnbull">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9yvBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA22 |title=A History of Modern Singapore, 1819–2005 |author= C.M.

The British governor [[Stamford Raffles]] arrived in Singapore on 28 January 1819 and soon recognised the island as a natural choice for the new port.  The island was then nominally ruled by [[Abdul Rahman Muazzam Shah of Johor|Tengku Abdul Rahman]], the [[Sultan of Johor]], who was controlled by the Dutch and the [[Bugis]]. However, the [[Sultanate]] was weakened by factional division; the [[Temenggong]] (or Chief Minister) Tengku Abdu'r Rahman and his officials were loyal to Tengku Rahman's elder brother [[Hussein Shah of Johor|Tengku Long]] who was living in [[exile]] in [[Riau Islands|Riau]]. With the Temenggong's help, Raffles managed to smuggle Tengku Long back into Singapore. He offered to recognise Tengku Long as the rightful Sultan of Johor, given the title of Sultan Hussein and provide him with a yearly payment of $5000 and $3000 to the Temenggong; in return, Sultan Hussein would grant the British the right to establish a trading post on Singapore.<ref name="uslcFounding">{{cite web | title = Singapore – Founding and Early Years | url = http://countrystudies.us/singapore/4.htm | publisher =[[U.S. Library of Congress]] | accessdate = 18 July 2006 }}</ref> A formal treaty was signed on 6 February 1819 and modern Singapore was born.<ref>{{cite web| title = 1819 – The February Documents | publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)|Ministry of Defence]] | date = 7 February 1997 | accessdate =18 July 2006 | author=Jenny Ng | url = http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/overview/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Milestones in Singapore's Legal History |publisher=[[Supreme Court, Singapore]] |accessdate=18 July 2006 |url=http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39l |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183512/http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39l |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref>

Singapore was not much affected by [[First World War]] (1914–18) since the conflict did not spread to Southeast Asia.  The only significant event during the war was a [[1915 Singapore Mutiny|mutiny]] by the [[Muslim]] [[sepoys]] from British India who were garrisoned in Singapore, which occurred in 1915.  After hearing rumours that they were to be sent off to fight the [[Ottoman Empire]], which was a Muslim state, the soldiers rebelled. They killed their officers and several British civilians before the mutiny was suppressed by non-Muslim troops arriving from [[Johore]] and [[Burma]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} After the First World War, the British built the large [[Singapore Naval Base]] as part of the defensive [[Singapore strategy]]. Originally announced in 1923, the construction of the base proceeded slowly until the [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria]] in 1931. When completed in 1939, at the very large cost of $500&nbsp;million, it boasted what was then the largest [[dry dock]] in the world, the third-largest [[floating dock (jetty)|floating dock]], and having enough fuel tanks to support the entire British navy for six months. It was defended by heavy 15-inch naval guns stationed at [[Fort Siloso]], [[Fort Canning]] and Labrador, as well as a [[Royal Air Force]] airfield at [[Tengah Air Base]]. [[Winston Churchill]] touted it as the "[[Gibraltar]] of the East" and military discussions often referred to the base as simply "[[East of Suez]]". Unfortunately, it was a base without a fleet. The [[British Home Fleet]] was stationed in Europe, and the British could not afford to build a second fleet to protect its interests in Asia. The plan was for the Home Fleet to sail quickly to Singapore in the event of an emergency. However, after [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BH88kpvyrdYC&pg=PA90|title=Marshall of Singapore: A Biography|author=Kevin Tan |isbn=978-981-230-878-8|year=2008}}</ref>

British forces had [[Operation Zipper|planned to liberate Singapore]] in 1945; however, the war ended before these operations could be carried out.

===Post-war period===
{{Main|Operation Tiderace|Post-war Singapore}}

After the [[Japanese surrender]] to the Allies on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British troops led by Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]], [[Supreme Allied Commander]] for [[Southeast Asia Command]], returned to Singapore to receive formal surrender of the Japanese forces in the region from General [[Itagaki Seishiro]] on behalf of General [[Hisaichi Terauchi]] on 12 September 1945, and a British Military Administration was formed to govern the island until March 1946. Much of the infrastructure had been destroyed during the war, including harbour facilities at the [[Port of Singapore]]. There was also a shortage of food leading to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. High food prices, unemployment, and workers' discontent culminated into a series of strikes in 1947 causing massive stoppages in public transport and other services. By late 1947, the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing demand for tin and rubber around the world, but it would take several more years before the economy returned to pre-war levels.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar">{{cite web

The failure of Britain to successfully defend Singapore had destroyed its credibility as infallible ruler in the eyes of Singaporeans. The decades after the war saw a political awakening amongst the local populace and the rise of [[anti-colonialism|anti-colonial]] and nationalist sentiments, epitomised by the slogan ''[[Merdeka]]'', or "independence" in the Malay language. The British, on their part, were prepared to gradually increase [[self-governance]] for Singapore and Malaya.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar"/> On 1 April 1946, the [[Straits Settlements]] was dissolved and Singapore became a separate Crown Colony with a civil administration headed by a Governor. In July 1947, separate Executive and Legislative Councils were established and the election of six members of the Legislative Council was scheduled in the following year.<ref name="micaSelfGovernment">{{cite web | title = Towards Self-government | url = http://www.sg/explore/history_towards.htm  | publisher=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts, Singapore | accessdate =18 June 2006 }}</ref>

During the 1950s, Chinese communists with strong ties to the trade unions and Chinese schools waged a guerrilla war against the government, leading to the [[Malayan Emergency]]. The [[1954 National Service riots]], [[Hock Lee bus riots]], and [[Chinese middle schools riots]] in Singapore were all linked to these events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/12405/19.htm |title=Communism |website=Thinkquest |accessdate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207082203/http://library.thinkquest.org/12405/19.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}</ref> [[David Marshall (Singaporean politician)|David Marshall]], pro-independence leader of the [[Labour Front]], won Singapore's first general election in 1955.

During the [[Singaporean general election, 1959|May 1959 elections]], the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) won a landslide victory. Singapore became an internally self-governing state within the Commonwealth, with [[Lee Kuan Yew]] as its first Prime Minister.<ref name="yewnyt">{{cite news|title=Headliners; Retiring, Semi|date=2 December 1990|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DD123DF931A35751C1A966958260|accessdate=27 December 2008}}</ref> As a result, the 1959 general elections were the first after full internal [[History of Singapore#Self-government (1955–1963)|self-government]] was granted by the British authorities.

===Merger with Malaysia===
{{Main|Singapore in Malaysia}}

[[File:Lee Kuan Yew.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lee Kuan Yew]], the first Prime Minister, is also recognised as Singapore's founding father.]]

Despite their successes in governing Singapore, the PAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya due to strong ties between the two nations. It was thought that the merger would benefit the economy by creating a common market which will support new industries, solving the ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable pro-communist wing of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the [[Barisan Sosialis]], splitting from the PAP.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lee, T. H|year=1996|title=The Open United Front: The Communist Struggle in Singapore, 1954–1966|publisher=Singapore: South Seas Society}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Bloodworth, D|year=1986|title=The Tiger and the Trojan Horse|publisher=Singapore: Times Books International}}</ref> This was because the ruling party of Malaya, [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), was staunchly anti-communist and would support the non-communist faction of PAP against them. UMNO, who was initially sceptical of the idea of a merger as they distrust the PAP government and were concerned that the large Chinese population in Singapore would alter the racial balance on which their political power base depended, changed their minds about the merger after being afraid of being taken over by pro-communists. On 27 May 1961, Malaya's Prime Minister, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], made a surprise proposal of a [[Federation of Malaysia]], comprising existing [[Federation of Malaya]], Singapore, [[Brunei]] and the British Borneo territories of [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|North Borneo]] and [[Sarawak (British Crown colony)|Sarawak]].<ref>{{cite news |title=MCA: Wipe out extremists |date=18 February 1959 |newspaper= Singapore Standard}}</ref> The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population.<ref name=countrystudies10/> The British government, for its part, believed that the merger would prevent Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.<ref>{{cite news |title=Appeal To Singapore |url= http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19620328-1.2.70.1?ST=1&AT=advanced |newspaper=The Straits Times |location= Singapore |page=10 |date=28 March 1962}}</ref> To secure the [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] of the people, the PAP called for the [[1962 Merger Referendum of Singapore|1962 Merger Referendum]], which provided different terms for merger with Malaysia, but no options for avoiding it. As a result, on 16 September 1963, [[Post-war Singapore|Singapore]] joined with the [[Federation of Malaya]], the [[Crown Colony of Sarawak]] and the [[Crown Colony of North Borneo]] to form the new federation of [[Malaysia]] under the terms of the [[Malaysia Agreement]], with Singapore being granted a high level of autonomy compared to other states in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/1dab53ea-788c-461c-acfb-ca625b974c9c |title=Singapore becomes part of Malaysia |publisher=HistorySG |accessdate=6 February 2017}}</ref>

Even after the merger, the [[People's Action Party–United Malays National Organisation relations|Singapore state government and the Malaysian central government disagreed]] on many political and economic issues. Despite an earlier agreement to establish a common market, Singapore continued to face restrictions when trading with the rest of Malaysia. In retaliation, Singapore did not extend to Sabah and Sarawak the full extent of the loans agreed to for economic development of the two eastern states. The situation escalated to such an intensity that talks soon broke down and abusive speeches and writing became rife on both sides.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Singapore}}
Singapore has a highly developed [[market economy]], based historically on extended [[entrepôt]] trade. Along with Hong Kong, [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]], Singapore is one of the original [[Four Asian Tigers]], but has surpassed its peers in terms of GDP per capita. Between 1965 and 1995, growth rates averaged around 6 per cent per annum, transforming the living standards of the population.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

As Singapore is a small island with a high population density, the number of private cars on the road is restricted to curb pollution and congestion. Car buyers must pay for duties one-and-a-half times the vehicle's market value, and bid for a Singaporean [[Certificate of Entitlement]] (COE), which allows the car to run on the road for a decade. The cost of the Singaporean certificate of entitlement alone would buy a [[Porsche Boxster]] in the United States.

===Water supply and sanitation===

Access to water is universal, affordable, efficient and of high quality. Singapore relies on four main water sources, or "four national taps" -  water imported from neighbouring Malaysia, [[List of dams and reservoirs in Singapore|urban rainwater catchments]], [[reclaimed water]] ([[NEWater]]) and seawater [[desalination]]. <ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.pub.gov.sg/watersupply/singaporewaterstory |title= Singapore Water Story |publisher= Public Utilities Board |year= 2018 |access-date= 17 March 2018}}</ref> Singapore's approach does not rely only on physical infrastructure, but it also emphasises proper legislation and enforcement, water pricing, public education as well as research and development.<ref name="Luan">{{cite journal |author= Ivy Ong Bee Luan |title= Singapore Water Management Policies and Practices |journal= International Journal of Water Resources Development |year= 2010 |volume= 26 |issue=1 |pages= 65–80 |doi= 10.1080/07900620903392190}}</ref>

Singapore has declared that it will be water self-sufficient by the time its 1961 long-term water supply agreement with Malaysia expires in 2061. According to analysis by the [[Institute of Southeast Asian Studies]] in 2003,Singapore would already be water self-sufficient by 2011 and "the 'water threat' is less than what it seems to be".<ref>{{cite web|last=Poh Onn Lee|title=The water issue between Singapore and Malaysia: No solution in sight|url=http://cloud2.gdnet.org/~research_papers/The%20water%20issue%20between%20Singapore%20and%20Malaysia:%20No%20solution%20in%20sight|accessdate=11 August 2012|date=2003}}</ref> However, according to official forecasts water demand in Singapore is expected to double from 380 to 760 million gallons per day between 2010 and 2060. The increase is expected to come primarily from non-domestic water use, which accounted for 55% of water demand in 2010 and is expected to account for 70% of demand in 2060. By that time water demand is expected to be met by reclaimed water at the tune of 50% and by desalination accounting for 30%, compared to only 20% supplied by internal catchments.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bloomberg interview with Chew Men Leong, chief executive of PUB|title=Singapore To Meet Water Target Before Deadline: Southeast Asia|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-29/singapore-to-meet-water-target-before-deadline-southeast-asia.html|accessdate=9 August 2012|date=30 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805212635/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-29/singapore-to-meet-water-target-before-deadline-southeast-asia.html|archive-date=2012-08-05|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=PUB|title=Four National Taps Provide Water for All|url=http://www.pub.gov.sg/water/Pages/default.aspx|accessdate=10 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730063932/http://www.pub.gov.sg/water/Pages/default.aspx|archive-date=2012-07-30|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref>

Due to the need to invest in and upgrade the water system to address concerns such as [[climate change]] and increasing costs of producing water and maintaining water infrastructure, water prices in Singapore has been revised since 2017,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.sg/factually/content/why-increase-water-prices|title=Why increase water prices?|website=www.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref> its first revision since 2000. The prices will generally increase by 30% over two phases from 1 July 2017, with 75% of households will see an increase of less than $18 in their monthly water bills. To help households manage the higher water prices, the Government will provide eligible HDB households with additional U-Save rebates, ranging from $40 to $120 per annum  depending on the type of the HDB flat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pub.gov.sg/|title=PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency|last=PUB|website=PUB, Singapore's National Water Agency|language=en|access-date=2019-02-18}}</ref>

It is increasingly regarded as having four sub-literatures instead of one. Many significant works has been translated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal ''Singa'', published in the 1980s and 1990s with editors including [[Edwin Thumboo]] and [[Koh Buck Song]], as well as in multilingual anthologies such as ''Rhythms: A Singaporean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry'' (2000), in which the poems were all translated three times each into the three languages. A number of Singaporean writers such as [[Tan Swie Hian]] and [[Kuo Pao Kun]] have contributed work in more than one language, although such cross-linguistic fertilisation is becoming increasingly rare.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The choices are almost overwhelming even for locals.<ref name=fodor>{{cite news |last=Fieldmar |first=James |title=Singapore's Street Food 101 |url= http://www.fodors.com/news/street-food-in-singapore-6276.html |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=Fodor's |date=19 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=streetfood>{{cite news |last=Michaels |first=Rowena |title=Singapore's best street food ... just don't order frog porridge |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatlife/10204790/Singapores-best-street-food-...-just-dont-order-frog-porridge.html |accessdate=21 October 2013 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location= London |date=20 July 2013}}</ref> Although cooked food that originates from or still sold on streets can be found in many countries, the variety and reach of centralised hawker centres that serve heritage street food in Singapore is unmatched elsewhere.<ref name="Hawker2007">{{cite book |last1=Kong |first1=Lily |title=Singapore Hawker Centres : People, Places, Food |date=2007 |publisher=SNP |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-248-149-8}}</ref>

In 2018, there are 114 hawker centres spread across the city centre and heartland housing estates. They are maintained by the [[National Environment Agency]], which also grade each food stall for hygiene. The largest hawker centre is located on the second floor of Chinatown Complex with over 200 stalls.<ref name="Hawker2007" /> The complex is also home to the cheapest Michelin-starred meal in the world – a plate of soya-sauce chicken rice or noodles for S$2 (US$1.50). Two street food stalls in the city are the first in the world to be awarded a Michelin star each.<ref>{{cite news |last=Han |first=Kirsten |title=Michelin star for Singapore noodle stall where lunch is half the price of a Big Mac |url= https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/aug/04/michelin-star-for-singapore-noodle-stall-where-lunch-is-half-the-price-of-a-big-mac |work=The Guardian |date=4 August 2016 |location=London}}</ref>

Local food items generally belong to a particular ethnicity – Chinese, Malay and Indian; but diversity of cuisine has increased further by the "hybridisation" of different styles (e.g., the [[Peranakan cuisine]], a mix of Chinese and Malay cuisine). In hawker centres, cultural diffusion can also be noted when traditionally Malay hawker stalls also sells Tamil food. Chinese stalls may introduce Malay ingredients, cooking techniques or entire dishes into their range of catering. This continues to make the cuisine of Singapore significantly rich and a cultural attraction.<ref name="Foodways" />

'''Vietnam''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˌ|v|j|ɛ|t|ˈ|n|æ|m|,_|-|ˈ|n|ɑː|m}}, {{IPAc-en|us|ˌ|v|iː|ə|t|-|audio=En-us-Vietnam.ogg}};{{sfn|Jones|2011|p=532}} {{lang-vi|Việt Nam}} {{IPA-vi|vîət nāːm|pron|Vietnam.ogg}}), officially the '''Socialist Republic of Vietnam''' ({{lang-vi|Cộng hòa xã hội chủ nghĩa Việt Nam}}), is the easternmost country on the [[Indochina|Indochina Peninsula]]. With an estimated {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN Population|Viet Nam}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million inhabitants {{As of|{{UN Population|Year}}|lc=y}}, it is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|15th most populous country in the world]]. Vietnam is bordered by [[China]] to the north, [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]] to the west, part of [[Thailand]] to the southwest, and the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] across the [[South China Sea]] to the east and southeast.{{#tag:ref|The South China Sea is referred to in Vietnam as the East Sea ({{lang|vi|Biển Đông}}).{{sfn|Cham|2012}}|group="n"}} Its [[capital city]] has been [[Hanoi]] since the [[Reunification Day|reunification]] of [[North Vietnam|North]] and [[South Vietnam]] in 1976, while its most populous city is [[Ho Chi Minh City]].

During the 3rd century BC, ancient Vietnamese people inhabited modern-day [[northern Vietnam]] and established the state of [[Âu Lạc]].{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=XVII}} The independent state was annexed by [[Nanyue|Nam Việt]] in 179 BC.{{#tag:ref|Nam Việt is the Vietnamese pronunciation for Nanyue.|group="n"}} Nam Việt was subsequently annexed by the [[Han Dynasty|Han Empire]] and became part of [[Imperial China]] for over a millennium from 111 BC to 939 AD. An [[Ngô dynasty|independent Vietnamese state]] emerged in 939 following Vietnamese victory in the [[Battle of Bạch Đằng (938)|battle of Bạch Đằng]] against the [[Southern Han]]. Successive [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnamese imperial dynasties]] flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was [[French Indochina|colonised by the French]] in the mid-19th century.

French Indochina saw the [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|Japanese occupation]] in 1940 amidst the escalation of [[World War II]]. Following Japanese defeat in 1945, the Vietnamese fought French rule in the [[First Indochina War]]. On 2 September 1945, Vietnamese revolutionary leader [[Hồ Chí Minh]] declared Vietnam's independence from France and therefrom established a provisional communist state. After nine years of war, the Vietnamese declared victory in the decisive [[battle of Điện Biên Phủ]] in 1954. The nation was thereafter divided into two rival states, communist [[North Vietnam|North]]—the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and anti-communist [[South Vietnam|South]]—the Republic of Vietnam. Conflicts intensified in the [[Vietnam War]] with [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|extensive US intervention]] in support of South Vietnam from 1965 to 1973. The war ended with [[fall of Saigon|North Vietnamese victory]] in 1975.

North and South Vietnam were then reunified under a communist government in 1976. The newly established country remained impoverished and politically isolated until 1986, when the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] initiated a series of [[Đổi Mới|economic and political reforms]] that facilitated Vietnamese integration into the world economy. By 2010, Vietnam had established [[Foreign relations of Vietnam|diplomatic relations]] with 178 countries. Since 2000, Vietnam's GDP growth rate has been among the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|highest in the world]]. Its successful economic reforms resulted in its joining the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] in 2007. Vietnam is also a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN), [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) and the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF).

== Etymology ==
{{main|Names of Vietnam}}
The name {{lang|vi|Việt Nam}} ({{IPA-vi|viə̀t naːm}}) is a variation of {{lang|vi|[[Nanyue|Nam Việt]]}} ({{zh|c=[[wikt:南越|南越]]|p=Nányuè}}; literally "Southern ''Việt''"), a name that can be traced back to the [[Triệu dynasty]] of the 2nd century BC.{{sfn|Woods|2002|p=38}} The word ''Việt'' originated as a shortened form of [[Baiyue|Bách Việt]] ({{zh|c=[[Wikt:百越|百越]]|p=Bǎiyuè}}), a group of people then living in southern China and Vietnam.{{sfn|Yue Hashimoto|1972|p=1}} The form "Vietnam" ({{Vi-nom|{{linktext|越南}}}}) is first recorded in the 16th-century oracular poem ''[[Sấm Trạng Trình]]''. The name has also been found on 12 [[stele]]s carved in the 16th and 17th centuries, including one at Bao Lam Pagoda in [[Haiphong|Hải Phòng]] that dates to 1558.{{sfn|Phan|1976|p=510}} In 1802, [[Nguyễn Phúc Ánh]] (later become Emperor Gia Long) established the [[Nguyễn dynasty]], and in the second year, he asked the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] of the [[Qing dynasty]] to confer him the title 'King of Nam Viet/Nanyue' ({{lang|zh|南越}} in Chinese) after seizing Annam's ruling power but the latter refused since the name was related to [[Zhao Tuo]]'s Nanyue which includes the regions of [[Guangxi]] and [[Guangdong]] in southern China by which the Qing Emperor decide to call the area as "Viet Nam" instead.{{#tag:ref|At first, [[Gia Long]] requested the name "Nam Việt", but the [[Jiaqing Emperor]] refused.{{sfn|Woods|2002|p=38}}{{sfn|Shaofei|Guoqing|2016}}|name="etymology"|group="n"}}{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=932}} Between 1804 and 1813, the name Vietnam was used officially by Emperor Gia Long.<ref name="etymology" group="n"/> It was revived in the early 20th century by [[Phan Bội Châu]]'s ''[[History of the Loss of Vietnam]]'', and later by the [[Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng|Vietnamese Nationalist Party]] (VNQDĐ).{{sfn|Tonnesson|Antlov|1996|p=117}} The country was usually called Annam until 1945, when both the [[Empire of Vietnam|imperial government]] in [[Huế]] and the [[Việt Minh]] government in Hanoi adopted {{lang|vi|Việt Nam}}.{{sfn|Tonnesson|Antlov|1996|p=126}}

[[File:DrumFromSongDaVietnamDongSonIICultureMid1stMilleniumBCEBronze.jpg|left|thumb|A [[Đông Sơn drums|Đông Sơn]] bronze drum, {{circa|800 BC}}.]]
Archaeological excavations have revealed the existence of humans in what is now Vietnam as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age. ''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossils dating to around 500,000 BC have been found in caves in [[Lạng Sơn Province|Lạng Sơn]] and [[Nghệ An Province|Nghệ An]] provinces in northern Vietnam.{{sfn|McKinney|2009}} The oldest ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' fossils from mainland Southeast Asia are of [[Middle Pleistocene]] provenance, and include isolated tooth fragments from Tham Om and Hang Hum.{{sfn|Akazawa|Aoki|Kimura|1992|p=321}}{{sfn|Rabett|2012|p=109}}{{sfn|Dennell|Porr|2014|p=41}} Teeth attributed to ''Homo sapiens'' from the [[Late Pleistocene]] have also been found at Dong Can,{{sfn|Matsumura|Yoneda|Yukio|Oxenham|2008|p=12}} and from the Early [[Holocene]] at Mai Da Dieu,{{sfn|Matsumura|Lan Cuong|Kim Thuy|Anezaki|2001}}{{sfn|Oxenham|Tayles|2006|p=36}} Lang Gao{{sfn|anon.|1985|p=16}}{{sfn|Karlström|Källén|2002|p=83}} and Lang Cuom.{{sfn|Oxenham|Buckley|2015|p=329}} By about 1,000 BC, the development of wet-[[rice]] cultivation and [[bronze]] casting in the [[Ma River]] and [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] floodplains led to the flourishing of the [[Đông Sơn culture]],{{sfn|Higham|1984}}{{sfn|Nang Chung|Giang Hai|2017|p=31}} notable for its elaborate bronze [[Đông Sơn drums]].{{sfn|de Laet|Herrmann|1996|p=408}}{{sfn|Calò|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=31}} At this time, the early Vietnamese kingdoms of [[Văn Lang]] and [[Âu Lạc]] appeared, and the culture's influence spread to other parts of [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], throughout the first millennium BC.{{sfn|Calò|2009|p=51}}{{sfn|Cooke|Li|Anderson|2011|p=46}}

=== Dynastic Vietnam ===
[[File:Territorial expansion of Vietnam from Lý dynasty to Nguyễn dynasty (1009–1834).gif|thumb|Territorial expansion of Vietnam, 1009–1834]]

The [[Hồng Bàng dynasty]] of the [[Hùng kings]] is considered to be the first Vietnamese state, known in Vietnamese as Văn Lang.{{sfn|Pelley|2002|p=151}}{{sfn|Cottrell|2009|p=14}} In 257 BC, the last Hùng king was defeated by Thục Phán, who consolidated the [[Lạc Việt]] and [[Âu Việt]] tribes to form the [[Âu Lạc]], proclaiming himself [[An Dương Vương]].{{sfn|Đức Trần|Thư Hà|2000|p=8}} In 179 BC, a Chinese general named [[Zhao Tuo]] defeated An Dương Vương and consolidated Âu Lạc into [[Nanyue]].{{sfn|Nang Chung|Giang Hai|2017|p=31}} However, Nanyue was itself [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|incorporated into the empire]] of the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] in 111 BC after the [[Han–Nanyue War]].{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=932}}{{sfn|Yao|2016|p=62}} For the next thousand years, what is now northern Vietnam remained mostly under [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|Chinese rule]].{{sfn|Holmgren|1980}}{{sfn|Taylor|1983|p=30}} Early independence movements, such as those of the [[Trưng Sisters]] and [[Lady Triệu]],{{sfn|Pelley|2002|p=177}} were only temporarily successful,{{sfn|Cottrell|2009|p=15}} though the region gained a longer period of independence as Vạn Xuân under the [[Anterior Lý dynasty]] between AD 544 and 602.{{sfn|Thái Nguyên|Mừng Nguyẽ̂n|1958|p=33}}{{sfn|Chesneaux|1966|p=20}}{{sfn|anon.|1972|p=24}} By the early 10th century, Vietnam had gained autonomy, but not sovereignty, under the [[Khúc family]].{{sfn|Tuyet Tran|Reid|2006|p=32}}

In AD 938, the Vietnamese lord [[Ngô Quyền]] defeated the forces of the Chinese [[Southern Han]] state at [[Battle of Bạch Đằng (938)|Bạch Đằng River]] and achieved full independence for Vietnam after a millennium of Chinese domination.{{sfn|Hiẻ̂n Lê|2003|p=65}}{{sfn|Hong Lien|Sharrock|2014|p=55}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=226}} Renamed as Đại Việt (''Great Viet''), the nation enjoyed a golden era under the Lý and [[Trần dynasty|Trần]] dynasties. During the rule of the Trần Dynasty, Đại Việt repelled three [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|Mongol invasions]].{{sfn|Cottrell|2009|p=16}}{{sfn|Hong Lien|Sharrock|2014|p=95}} Meanwhile, [[Buddhism in Vietnam|Buddhism]] of [[Mahāyāna]] tradition flourished and became the state religion.{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=226}}{{sfn|Keyes|1995|p=183}} Following the 1406–7 [[Ming–Hồ War]] which overthrew the [[Hồ dynasty]], Vietnamese independence was [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|briefly interrupted]] by the Chinese [[Ming dynasty]], but was restored by [[Lê Lợi]], the founder of the [[Lê dynasty]].{{sfn|Hong Lien|Sharrock|2014|p=111}} The Vietnamese dynasties reached their zenith in the Lê dynasty of the 15th century, especially during the reign of Emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]] (1460–1497).{{sfn|Hong Lien|Sharrock|2014|p=120}}{{sfn|Kiernan|2017|p=265}} Between the 11th and 18th centuries, Vietnam expanded southward in a process known as {{lang|vi|nam tiến}} ("[[History of Vietnam#Champa|southward expansion]]"),{{sfn|Anderson|Whitmore|2014|p=158}} eventually conquering the kingdom of [[Champa]] and part of the [[Khmer Empire]].{{sfn|Vo|2011|p=13}}{{sfn|Ooi|Anh Tuan|2015|p=212}}{{sfn|Phuong Linh|2016|p=39}}

From the 16th century onward, civil strife and frequent political infighting engulfed much of Vietnam. First, the Chinese-supported [[Mạc dynasty]] challenged the Lê dynasty's power.{{sfn|Anderson|Whitmore|2014|p=174}} After the Mạc dynasty was defeated, the Lê dynasty was nominally reinstalled, but actual power was divided between the northern [[Trịnh lords]] and the southern [[Nguyễn lords]], who engaged in a [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War|civil war]] for more than four decades before a truce was called in the 1670s.{{sfn|Leonard|1984|p=131}} During this time, the Nguyễn expanded southern Vietnam into the [[Mekong Delta]], annexing the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] and the Khmer lands in the Mekong Delta.{{sfn|Vo|2011|p=13}}{{sfn|Phuong Linh|2016|p=39}}{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=356}} The division of the country ended a century later when the [[Tây Sơn]] brothers established a new dynasty. However, their rule did not last long, and they were defeated by the remnants of the Nguyễn lords, led by [[Gia Long|Nguyễn Ánh]] and aided by the French.{{sfn|Page|Sonnenburg|2003|p=723}} Nguyễn Ánh unified Vietnam, and established the [[Nguyễn dynasty]], ruling under the name [[Gia Long]].{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=356}}

Since the 1500s, the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] have become acquainted with Vietnamese coast where they reportedly erected a [[stele]] in [[Chàm Islands]] to mark their presence.{{sfn|Tuấn Hoáng|2007|p=50}} By 1533, the Portuguese began to land into the Vietnamese delta but were forced to leave due to local turmoil and fighting. They also had less interest in the territory than in both kingdoms in China and Japan.{{sfn|Tuấn Hoáng|2007|p=50}} After having successfully settled [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]] and [[Portuguese Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] to begin the profitable Macau-Japan trade, the Portuguese began to be involved in trade with [[Hội An]] where many Portuguese traders and their [[Catholicism|Catholic]] missionaries set their foot into the Vietnamese kingdom.{{sfn|Tuấn Hoáng|2007|p=50}} The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] also tried to establish contact with Vietnam through the central part of Quinam in 1601 but failed to maintain long presence there after several violent encounter with the locals. The [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC) only managed to establish official relations with [[Tonkin]] in the spring of 1637 after leaving [[Dejima]] in Japan to establishing trade for [[silk]].{{sfn|Tuấn Hoáng|2007|p=52}} Meanwhile, the [[British Empire|English]] first attempt through the [[East India Company]] (EIC) to establishing contact with Hội An in 1613 are failed following a violent incident involving their merchant but the English return to establishing relations with Tonkin by 1672 where they were allowed to reside in [[Hưng Yên|Phố Hiến]].{{sfn|Tuấn Hoáng|2007|p=53}}

From between 1615–1753, French traders also engaged in trade in the area around [[Đàng Trong]] and actively spreading missionaries.{{sfn|Li|1998|p=89}}{{sfn|Lockard|2010|p=479}} Following the detention of several missionaries as the Vietnamese kingdom feel threatened with the continuous [[Christianisation]] activities,{{sfn|McLeod|1991|p=22}} the [[French Navy]] received approval from their government to intervene in Vietnam in 1834 with the aim to free imprisoned Catholic missionaries from a kingdom that was perceived as [[xenophobic]] against foreign influence.{{sfn|Woods|2002|p=245}} Vietnam's kingdom independence was then gradually [[French colonial empire|eroded by France]] which was aided by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and large Catholic militias in a series of military conquests between 1859 and 1885.{{sfn|Cortada|1994|p=29}}{{sfn|Keith|2012|p=50}} In 1862, the southern third of the country became the French colony of [[French Cochinchina|Cochinchina]].{{sfn|McLeod|1991|p=61}} By 1884, the entire country had come under French rule, with the central and northern parts of Vietnam separated in the two protectorates of [[Annam (French protectorate)|Annam]] and [[Tonkin (French protectorate)|Tonkin]]. The three Vietnamese entities were formally integrated into the union of [[French Indochina]] in 1887.{{sfn|Ooi|2004|p=520}}{{sfn|Cook|2001|p=396}} The French administration imposed significant political and cultural changes on Vietnamese society.{{sfn|Frankum Jr.|2011|p=172}} A Western-style system of modern education was developed and Catholicism was propagated widely.{{sfn|Nhu Nguyen|2016|p=37}} Most French settlers in Indochina were concentrated in Cochinchina, particularly in the region of [[Saigon]] and in [[Hanoi]], the capital of the colony.{{sfn|Richardson|1876|p=269}}

Guerrillas of the royalist [[Cần Vương movement]] massacred around a third of Vietnam's Christian population during the colonial period as part of their rebellion against French rule,{{sfn|Keith|2012|p=53}}{{sfn|Anh Ngo|2016|p=71}} but were defeated in the 1890s after a decade of resistance by the Catholics as a reprisal of their earlier massacres.{{sfn|Quach Langlet|1991|p=360}}{{sfn|Ramsay|2008|p=171}} Another large-scale rebellion, the [[Thái Nguyên uprising]] was also suppressed heavily.{{sfn|Zinoman|2000}} The French developed a [[plantation economy]] to promote the export of [[tobacco]], [[indigo dye|indigo]], [[tea]] and [[coffee]],{{sfn|Lim|2014|p=33}} however, they largely ignored the increasing demands for civil rights and [[self-government]]. A nationalist political movement soon emerged, with leaders such as [[Phan Bội Châu]], [[Phan Châu Trinh]], [[Phan Đình Phùng]], Emperor [[Hàm Nghi]], and [[Hồ Chí Minh]] fighting or calling for independence.{{sfn|Largo|2002|p=112}} This resulted in the 1930 [[Yên Bái mutiny]] by the [[Việt Nam Quốc Dân Đảng|Vietnamese Nationalist Party]] (VNQDĐ) which was suppressed heavily by the French.

Afterwards, the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]] was allowed to station its troops in Vietnam while permitting the pro-[[Vichy France|Vichy French]] colonial administration to continue.{{sfn|Miller|1990|p=293}}{{sfn|Gettleman|Franklin|Young|Franklin|1995|p=4}} Japan exploited Vietnam's natural resources to support its military campaigns, culminating in a [[Japanese coup d'état in French Indochina|full-scale takeover of the country]] in March 1945 and the [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945]], which caused up to two million deaths.{{sfn|Thanh Niên|2015}}{{sfn|Vietnam Net|2015}}

In 1941, the [[Việt Minh]], a nationalist liberation movement based on a Communist ideology, emerged under the Vietnamese revolutionary leader [[Hồ Chí Minh]].

However, as the French were weakened as a result of [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]], the British-[[British Raj|Indian]] forces together with the remaining Japanese [[Southern Expeditionary Army Group]] were used to maintain order and to help France re-establish control through the [[War in Vietnam (1945–46)|1945–1946 War in Vietnam]].{{sfn|Neville|2007|p=124}} Hồ Chí Minh at the time chose a moderate stance to avoid military conflict with France by which he asked the French to withdraw their colonial administrators, and asked for aid from French professors and engineers to help build a modern independent Vietnam.{{sfn|Pike|2011|p=192}} These requests, including the idea for independence, however could not be accepted by the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]], which dispatched the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] instead to restore colonial rule, causing the Việt Minh to launch a guerrilla campaign against the French in late 1946.{{sfn|Joes|1992|p=95}}{{sfn|Pike|2011|p=192}}{{sfn|Tonnesson|2011|p=66}} Matters also turned worse when the Republic of China gradually fell to the communists in the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]].

The colonial administration was ended and French Indochina was dissolved under the Geneva Accords of 1954 into three countries: Vietnam and the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Cambodia (1953–70)|Cambodia]] and [[Kingdom of Laos|Laos]].

{{main|Vietnam War|Role of the United States in the Vietnam War}}
Between 1953 and 1956, the North Vietnamese government instituted various agrarian reforms, including "rent reduction" and "[[Land reform in Vietnam|land reform]]", which resulted in significant political oppression.{{sfn|Moïse|2017|p=56}} During the land reform, testimony from North Vietnamese witnesses suggested a ratio of one execution for every 160 village residents, which extrapolated nationwide would indicate nearly 100,000 executions.{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=143}} Because the campaign was concentrated mainly in the [[Red River Delta]] area, a lower estimate of 50,000 executions became widely accepted by scholars at the time.{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=143}}{{sfn|Gittinger|1959}} However, declassified documents from the Vietnamese and Hungarian archives indicate that the number of executions was much lower than reported at the time, although likely greater than 13,500.{{sfn|Vu|2007}} In the South, Diệm countered North Vietnamese subversion (including the assassination of over 450 South Vietnamese officials in 1956) by detaining tens of thousands of suspected communists in "political re-education centres".{{sfn|Heneghan|1969|p=160}}{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=177}} This was a ruthless program that incarcerated many non-communists, although it was also successful at curtailing communist activity in the country, if only for a time.{{sfn|Crozier|1955}} The North Vietnamese government claimed that 2,148 individuals were killed in the process by November 1957.{{sfn|Turner|1975|p=174–178}} The pro-Hanoi [[Việt Cộng]] began a guerrilla campaign in the late 1950s to overthrow Diệm's government.{{sfn|Gilbert|2013|p=292}} From 1960, the [[Soviet Union]] and North Vietnam signed treaties providing for further Soviet military support.{{sfn|Jukes|1973|p=209}}{{sfn|Olsen|2007|p=92}}{{sfn|Khoo|2011|p=27}}

In 2010, Vietnam's total state spending on science and technology equalled around 0.45% of its GDP.{{sfn|Việt Nam News|2010}} Since the dynastic era, Vietnamese scholars has developed many academic fields especially in [[social science]]s and humanities. Vietnam has a millennium-deep legacy of analytical histories, such as the ''[[Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư]]'' of [[Ngô Sĩ Liên]]. Vietnamese monks led by the abdicated Emperor [[Trần Nhân Tông]] developed the Trúc Lâm Zen branch of philosophy in the 13th century.{{sfn|Różycka-Tran|Anh Tran|2014|p=123}} [[Arithmetic]]s and [[geometry]] have been widely taught in Vietnam since the 15th century, using the textbook ''Đại thành toán pháp'' by Lương Thế Vinh as a basis. Lương Thế Vinh introduced Vietnam to the notion of [[0 (number)|zero]], while Mạc Hiển Tích used the term ''số ẩn'' (en: "unknown/secret/hidden number") to refer to [[negative number]]s. Vietnamese scholars furthermore produced numerous [[encyclopaedia]]s, such as [[Lê Quý Đôn]]'s ''Vân đài loại ngữ''. In modern times, Vietnamese scientists have made many significant contributions in various fields of study, most notably in [[mathematics]].

The autonomy which Vietnamese research centres have enjoyed since the mid-1990s has enabled many of them to operate as quasi-private organisations, providing services such as consulting and technology development.{{sfn|UNESCO Publishing|p=713–714}} Some have 'spun off' from the larger institutions to form their own semi-private enterprises, fostering the transfer of public sector science and technology personnel to these semi-private establishments. One comparatively new university, the [[Tôn Đức Thắng University]] which built in 1997 has already set up 13 centres for technology transfer and services that together produce 15% of university revenue.

[[Bicycle]]s, [[motorcycle]]s and [[motor scooter]]s remain the most popular forms of road transport in the country as one of the legacy of French through transportation although the number of privately owned [[car]]s have been rising in recent years.{{sfn|Huu Duc|Mai Hoa|Thien Huong|Ngoc Bao|2013|p=2080}} Public buses operated by private companies are the main mode of long-distance travel for much of the population. [[Traffic collision|Road accidents]] remain the major safety issue in Vietnamese transportation with an average of 30 people lost their lives daily,{{sfn|Vietnam General Statistics Office|2011}} while [[traffic congestion]] is a growing problem in both major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City especially with the growing of individual car ownership.{{sfn|Linh Le|Anh Trinh|2016}}{{sfn|Sohr|Brockfeld|Sauerländer|Melde|2016|p=220}} Vietnam's primary cross-country rail service is the [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|Reunification Express]] from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi with a distance of nearly {{convert|1726|km|mi}}.{{sfn|Chin|2018}} From Hanoi, railway lines branch out to the northeast, north and west; the eastbound line runs from Hanoi to Hạ Long Bay, the northbound line from Hanoi to [[Thái Nguyên]], and the northeast line from Hanoi to Lào Cai. In 2009, Vietnam and Japan signed a deal to build a [[North–South Express Railway (Vietnam)|high-speed railway]] by using the technology of Japanese ''[[Shinkansen]]'';{{sfn|The Japan Times|2009}} numerous Vietnamese engineers were later sent to Japan to receive training in the operation and maintenance of high-speed trains.{{sfn|Vietnam+|2008}} The planned railway will be a {{convert|1,545|km|mi|0}} long express route serving a total of 23 stations including in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with 70% of its route will running on bridges and through underground tunnels,{{sfn|The Nation|2018}}{{sfn|Vietnam Net|2018b}} while the trains will travelling at a maximum speed of {{convert|350|km|mi}} per hour.{{sfn|Vietnam Net|2018b}}{{sfn|South East Asia Iron and Steel Institute|2009}} The plan for the country first high-speed rail however are being postponed with the Vietnamese government made a decision to putting the main priority on the development of both [[Hanoi Metro]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City Metro]] as well the expansion of road networks instead.{{sfn|Chin|2018}}{{sfn|Chi|2017}}{{sfn|Tatarski|2017}}

[[File:Chùa Vẽ Terminal, Port of Hải Phòng.JPG|thumb|Port of [[Hai Phong]] is one of the largest and busiest container ports in Vietnam.]]
Vietnam operates 20 major civil airports, including three international gateways: [[Noi Bai]] in Hanoi, [[Da Nang International Airport]] in Đà Nẵng and [[Tan Son Nhat]] in Ho Chi Minh City. Tan Son Nhat is the nation's largest airport by which it handling the majority of international passenger traffic.{{sfn|Hoang|2016|p=1}} According to a state-approved plan, Vietnam will have another seven international airports by 2015, these include [[Vinh International Airport]], [[Phu Bai International Airport]], [[Cam Ranh International Airport]], [[Phu Quoc International Airport]], [[Cat Bi International Airport]], [[Can Tho International Airport]] and [[Long Thanh International Airport]]. The planned Long Thanh International Airport will have an annual service capacity of 100 million passengers once it becomes fully operational in 2025.{{sfn|Vietnam Investment Review|2018}} [[Vietnam Airlines]], the state-owned national airline maintains a fleet of 86 passenger aircraft and aims to operate 170 by 2020.{{sfn|Ha|Giang|Denslow|2012}} Several private airlines are also in operation in Vietnam, including [[Air Mekong]], [[Bamboo Airways]], [[Jetstar Pacific Airlines]], [[Vietnam Air Service Company|VASCO]] and [[VietJet Air]]. As a coastal country, Vietnam has many major sea ports, including [[Cam Ranh]], Đà Nẵng, [[Haiphong|Hải Phòng]], Ho Chi Minh City, [[Hạ Long]], [[Qui Nhơn]], [[Vũng Tàu]], [[Cửa Lò]] and [[Nha Trang]]. Further inland, the country's extensive network of rivers play a key role in rural transportation with over {{convert|47,130|km|mi}} of navigable [[waterway]]s carrying ferries, barges and [[water taxi]]s.{{sfn|Index Mundi|2018}}

Vietnam's energy sector is largely dominated by [[Vietnam Electricity|Electricity of Vietnam]] (EVN) nationwide. As of 2017, EVN contributed about 61.4% of the country power generation system with a total power capacity of 25,884 [[Megawatt|MW]].{{sfn|Electricity of Vietnam|2017|p=10}} Other energy source are distributed by [[PetroVietnam]] (4,435 MW), [[Vinacomin]] (1,785 MW) and by [[build–operate–transfer]] (BOT) with other investors (10,031 MW).{{sfn|Electricity of Vietnam|2017|p=12}} Most of the powers are generated from either [[hydropower]], [[fossil fuel power station|fossil fuel power]] such as [[coal]], [[oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] while the remaining are from [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[small hydropower]] and renewable energy.{{sfn|Electricity of Vietnam|2017|p=12}} The Vietnamese government also previously planning to develop their first [[nuclear reactor]] as the path to establish [[Nuclear energy in Vietnam|another source of electric energy]] from [[nuclear power]] but the plan was abandoned in late 2016 with a majority oppose vote through the country National Assembly due to large concerns from Vietnamese society over [[radioactive contamination]].{{sfn|Nguyen|Binh Minh|Pham|Burmistrova|2016}} The household gas sector in Vietnam is dominated by PetroVietnam which controls nearly 70% of the country domestic market for [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG).{{sfn|Nikkei Asian Review}} Since 2011, the company also operating five renewable energy power plants including the Nhơn Trạch 2 Thermal Power Plant (750 MW), Phú Quý Wind Power Plant (6 MW), Hủa Na Hydro-power Plant (180 MW), Dakdrinh Hydro-power Plant (125 MW) and Vũng Áng 1 Thermal Power Plant (1,200 MW).{{sfn|Viet Trung|Quoc Viet|Van Chat|2016|p=70}} According to statistics by the [[British Petroleum]] (BP), Vietnam is listed among the 52 countries that have oil and gas potential in the world with [[List of countries by proven oil reserves|proven crude oil reserves]] of the country in 2015 were approximately 4.4 billion barrels and ranked first place in Southeast Asia, while the [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|proven gas reserves]] were about 0.6 trillion cubic metres (tcm) and ranked the third place in Southeast Asia after [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].{{sfn|Viet Trung|Quoc Viet|Van Chat|2016|p=64}}

=== Telecommunication ===
{{main|Telecommunications in Vietnam}}
Telecommunications services in Vietnam is wholly provided by the Vietnam Post and Telecommunications General Corporation (now the [[VNPT]] Group) which is a [[state-owned]] company.{{sfn|Pham|2015|p=6}} The VNPT retained its monopoly until 1986 before the telecom sector being reformed in 1995 when the Vietnamese government started to implement a competitive policy with the creation of two domestic telecommunication  companies, the Military Electronic and Telecommunication Company ([[Viettel]] which is wholly owned by the Vietnamese Ministry of Defence) and the Saigon Post and Telecommunication Company (SPT or SaigonPostel), with 18% of it are owned by VNPT.{{sfn|Pham|2015|p=6}} The whole monopoly by VNPT was finally removed by the government in 2003 with the issuance of a decree.{{sfn|Pham|2015|p=7}} By 2012, the top three major telecom operators in Vietnam is Viettel, [[Vinaphone]] and [[MobiFone]] while the remaining is owned by [[EVNTelecom]], Vietnammobile and [[S-Fone]].{{sfn|Việt Nam News|2012}} With the shift towards a more [[market economy|market-orientated economy]], Vietnam's telecommunications market is continuously being reformed to attract foreign investment which includes the supply of services and the establishment of telecom infrastructure nationwide.{{sfn|Oxford Business Group|2017}}

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{main|Water supply and sanitation in Vietnam}}
[[File:Village vietnam sapa bridge.jpg|thumb|right|In rural areas of Vietnam, [[water supply|piped water systems]] are operated by a wide variety of institutions including a national organisation, people committees (local government), community groups, co-operatives and private companies.]]
Vietnam has 2,360 rivers with average annual discharge of 310 billion [[cubic metre|m³]] by which raining season accounts for 70% of the whole year discharge.{{sfn|United Kingdom Department for International Trade|2017|p=1}} Most urban [[water supply]] systems in the country have been developed without proper management since the past 10 years. Based on a 2008 survey by Vietnam Water Supply and Sewerage Association (VWSA), the existing water production capacity even exceeded the demand but the service coverage is still very low since most of clean water supply infrastructures are not much developed where it only been delivered to a small proportion of the population with about one third of 727 district towns having some form of piped water supply.{{sfn|United Kingdom Department for International Trade|2017|p=2}} There is also concern on the safety of existing water resources for urban and rural water supply systems since domestic and industrial factories releasing their [[wastewater]] directly into the water sources without treatment where the government does not take more urgent measures to address the problem with the majority of domestic wastewater is discharged back to the environment and polluting the [[surface water]].{{sfn|United Kingdom Department for International Trade|2017|p=2}}

In recent years, there have been some efforts and collaboration between local and foreign universities to developing access to safe water in the country by introducing [[water filter|water filtration system]] with the growing concern from local population about the serious public health issues associated with water contamination caused by pollution as well the [[arsenic contamination of groundwater|high levels of arsenic]] in their [[groundwater]] sources.{{sfn|University of Technology Sydney|2018}} The government of [[Netherlands]] also have been providing aid by focusing its entirety investments in the country mainly on water-related sectors including in [[water treatment]] projects.{{sfn|Government of the Netherlands|2016}}{{sfn|Government of the Netherlands|2018}}{{sfn|Anh|2018}} Regarding [[sanitation]], 78% of the population in Vietnam had access to [[Improved sanitation|"improved" sanitation]] or 94% of the urban population and 70% of the rural population despite there are still about 21 million people in the country lacked accessed to "improved" sanitation according to a survey conducted in 2015.{{sfn|UNICEF|2015}} In 2018, the construction ministry said that the country water supply and drainage industry had been applying hi-tech methods and [[information technology]] (IT) but facing problems such as limited funding, climate change and pollution.{{sfn|Việt Nam News|2018c}} The health ministry also have announced that water inspection units will be established in the country nationwide from June 2019 with inspections to be conducted without notice since there have been many cases involving health caused by poor and polluted water supply as well hygiene conditions are reported every year.{{sfn|Việt Nam News|2018d}}

Since the early 2000s, Vietnam has made significant progress in combating [[malaria]], with the malaria mortality rate falling to about 5% of its 1990s equivalent by 2005, after the country introduced improved antimalarial drugs and treatment.{{sfn|Van Nam|de Vries|Van Toi|Nagelkerke|2005}} [[Tuberculosis]] (TB) cases however are on the rise which become the second most infectious diseases in the country after [[respiratory disease|respiratory-related illness]].{{sfn|Trinh|Nguyen|Do|Nguyen|2016}} With an intensified vaccination program, better hygiene and foreign assistance, Vietnam hopes to reduce sharply the number of TB cases and annual new TB infections.{{sfn|McNeil Jr.|2016}} In 2004, government subsidies covering about 15% of health care expenses.{{sfn|Lieberman|Wagstaff|2009|p=40}} Along the same year, the United States announced that Vietnam would be one of 15 nations to receive funding as part of its global AIDS relief plan.{{sfn|Manyin|2005|p=4}} By the following year, Vietnam had diagnosed 101,291 [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) cases, of which 16,528 progressed to [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) with 9,554 have died.{{sfn|Vietnam Women's Union|2005}} The actual number of HIV-positive individuals is estimated to be much higher as on average as between 40–50 new infections are reported daily in the country. In 2007, 0.4% of the population is estimated to be infected with HIV and the figure has remained stable since 2005.{{sfn|World Bank|2018a}} More global aid are being delivered through [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]] to fight the spread of the diseases in the country.{{sfn|McNeil Jr.|2016}} In September 2018, the Hanoi People's Committee urged the citizens of the country to stop eating [[dog meat|dog]] and [[cat meat]] as it can cause other diseases like [[rabies]] and [[leptospirosis]] as more than 1,000 stores in the capital city of Hanoi are found to be selling both meats. The decision received positive comments among Vietnamese society on [[social media]] despite many still disagreed as it has been a habit that couldn't be resisted.{{sfn|BBC News|2018}}

=== Education ===
{{main|Education in Vietnam}}
[[File:VNU lethanhtong 900x600.jpg|thumb|left|[[Indochina Medical College]] in Hanoi, the first modern university in Vietnam]]
Vietnam has an extensive state-controlled network of schools, colleges and universities and a growing number of privately run and partially privatised institutions. General education in Vietnam is divided into five categories: [[kindergarten]], [[elementary school]]s, [[middle school]]s, [[high school]]s, and [[universities]]. A large number of public schools have been constructed across the country to raise the national [[literacy rate]], which stood at 90% in 2008.{{sfn|UNICEF}} Most universities are located in major cities of Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City with the country education system continuously undergoing a series of reform by the government. [[Basic education]] in the country is relatively free for the poor although some families may still have trouble paying tuition fee for their children without some form of public or private assistance.{{sfn|Ha Trân|2014}} Regardless, school enrolment is among the highest in the world,{{sfn|World Bank|2013}}{{sfn|World Bank|2015}} and the number of colleges and universities increased dramatically in the 2000s from 178 in 2000 to 299 in 2005. In higher education, the government provide subsidised loans for students through national bank although there are deep concerns about its access as well the burdens among students in repaying.{{sfn|Pham|2012}}{{sfn|Chapman|Liu|2013}}Since 1995, enrolment in higher education has grown tenfold to over 2.2 million with 84,000 lecturers and 419 institutions of higher education.{{sfn|de Mora|Wood|2014|p=55}} A number of foreign universities operate private campuses in Vietnam, including [[Harvard University]] (USA) and the [[RMIT University Vietnam|Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]] (Australia). The government's strong commitment to education has fostered significant growth but still need to be sustained to retain academics. In 2018, a decree on university autonomy to operate independently without a ministry control above their heads are in its final stages of approval with the government will continue to investing in education especially for the poor to have access on basic education.{{sfn|Vietnam Net|2016b}}

{{As of|{{UN Population|Year}}}}, the population of Vietnam standing at approximately {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN Population|Viet Nam}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people.{{sfn|United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs}} The population had grown significantly from the 1979 census, which showed the total population of reunified Vietnam to be 52.7 million.{{sfn|SE|1980}} In 2012, the country's population was estimated at approximately 90.3 million.{{sfn|Canada Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration|2013|p=1}} Based on the 2009 census, 70.4% of the Vietnamese population are living in rural areas while only 29.6% living in urban areas although the average growth rate of the urban population have recently increasing which mainly attributed to migration and rapid urbanisation.{{sfn|Vietnam General Statistics Office|2009a}} The dominant [[Viet people|Viet]] or Kinh ethnic group constituted nearly 73.6 million people or 85.8% of the population,{{sfn|Canada Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration|2013|p=1}} with most of their population is concentrated mainly in the [[alluvial fans|alluvial deltas]] and coastal plains of the country. As a majority ethnic group, the Kinh possess significant political and economic influence over the country.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=21}} Despite this, Vietnam is also home to other 54 ethnic minority groups, including the [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Yao people|Dao]], [[Tay people|Tày]], [[Thai people|Thai]] and [[Nùng people|Nùng]].{{sfn|Canada Ministry of Citizenship and Immigration|2013|p=1}} Many ethnic minorities such as the [[Muong people|Muong]] who are closely related to the Kinh dwell in the highlands which cover two-thirds of Vietnam's territory.{{sfn|Government of Vietnam}}

Other uplanders in the north migrated from southern China between the 1300s and 1800s.{{sfn|Koskoff|2008|p=1316}} Since the partition of Vietnam, the population of the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] was almost exclusively [[Degar]] (including over 40 tribal groups); however, the South Vietnamese government at the time enacted a program of resettling Kinh in indigenous areas.{{sfn|Cultural Orientation Resource Centre|p=7}}{{sfn|Montagnard Human Rights Organisation}} The [[Hoa people|Hoa]] (ethnic [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]) and [[Khmer Krom]] people are mainly lowlanders.{{sfn|Jones|1998|p=21}}{{sfn|Koskoff|2008|p=1316}} Throughout Vietnam history, many Chinese people mainly from [[South China]] migrated to the country as administrators, merchants and even refugees.{{sfn|Dodd|Lewis|2003|p=531}} Since the reunification in 1976 with the increase of communist policies nationwide that resulting the nationalisation of property and subsequently causing many rich people property in the city especially among the Hoa in the south are being confiscated by the government, this has led many of them to leave Vietnam.{{sfn|Amer|1996}}{{sfn|Feinberg|2016}} Furthermore, with the deteriorating [[Sino-Vietnamese relations]] as a result of [[Sino-Vietnamese War|border invasion]] by Chinese government in 1979 which added by doubtful among Vietnamese society on the Chinese government intention had indirectly causing more Hoa people in the north to leave the country.{{sfn|Dodd|Lewis|2003|p=531}}{{sfn|Gough|1986}}

=== Urbanisation ===

[[File:Ho Chi Minh City Skyline (night).jpg|thumb|right|300x300px|[[District 1, Ho Chi Minh City|District 1]], Ho Chi Minh City.]]
The number of people live in urbanised area in 2017 is estimated to be around 32.753 million of people (with urbanisation rate at 35.7%).{{sfn|World Bank|2018b}} Since 1986, Vietnam's urbanisation rates have surged rapidly after the Vietnamese government implemented the Đổi Mới economic program, changing the system into socialist and liberalising property rights. As a result, Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (the two major cities in the Red River Delta and Southeast regions respectively) increased their share of the total urban population from 8.5% and 24.9% to 15.9% and 31% respectively.{{sfn|Vietnam General Statistics Office|2009b|p=117}} The Vietnamese government through its [[Ministry of Construction (Vietnam)|construction ministry]] forecasts that the country will have a 45% urbanisation rates by 2020 with urbanisation is said to have a positive correlation with economic growth as any country with higher urbanisation rates would have a higher growth rate of GDP.{{sfn|World Bank|2002}} Furthermore, the urbanisation movements in Vietnam is mainly between the rural areas and the country Southeast region. Ho Chi Minh City has received a large population of in-migrants mainly due to better weather and economic opportunities.{{sfn|Vietnam General Statistics Office|2009b|p=102}}

[[File:West Hanoi.jpg|thumb|left|Urbanization in west Hanoi]]
A study also shows that rural-to-urban area migrants have a higher standards of living than both non-migrants in rural areas and non-migrants in urban areas which also leads to changing in economic structures. In 1985, agriculture took up 37.2% of Vietnam's GDP; nevertheless, in 2008, that number went down to 18.5%, a decreasing of 18.7%.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} In 1985, industry took only a small fraction of Vietnam GDP, around 26.2%. But in 2008, that number has increased up to 43.2%. Urbanisation also helps to improve basic services which increase people's standards of living. Access to electricity has increased tremendously from 14% of total households&nbsp;having electricity in 1993 to above 96% in 2009.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} In terms of accessing to fresh water, data from 65 utility companies show that only 12% of households in the area covered by the companies had access to the water network in 2002. By 2007, more than 70% of the population in the area was connected. Though urbanisation has many benefits, it has some drawbacks since it creates more traffic, air and water pollution.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}}

Since Vietnam has a big consumption of [[moped]]s in their transportation due to the relatively cheap and easy to commute, large numbers of mopeds have been known for causing traffic and air pollution in Vietnam. In the capital city alone, the consumption of mopeds has increased from 0.5 million in 2001 to 4.7 million in 2013.{{sfn|Cira|Dastur|Kilroy|Lozano|2011|p=194}} With the rapid development, factories have sprung up rapidly which indirectly polluting air and water as been exampled from the [[2016 Vietnam marine life disaster]] caused by the [[Formosa Ha Tinh Steel|Formosa Ha Tinh Steel Company]] which killing many fish and marine habitats in Vietnamese waters and directly causing major losses to the country economy.{{sfn|Tiezzi|2016}} There are some government's interventions and solutions trying to decrease air pollution by decreasing the number of motorcycles while increasing public transportation and having more regulations for factories to handle their [[waste]]s. Although the authorities also have a time schedules for collecting different types of waste, waste disposal have become another problem of urbanisation since the amount of solid waste generated in urban areas has increased unimaginably by more than 200% from 2003 to 2008. Industrial solid waste alone, took up 181% of that 200%. One of the government's efforts is trying to promote campaigns to encourage the locals to sort [[municipal solid waste|household waste]] since [[waste sorting]] are still not been practised entirely by most Vietnamese society.{{sfn|Trương|2018|p=19}}

The official national language of the country is [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (''Tiếng Việt''), a tonal [[Austroasiatic languages]] (Mon–Khmer) which is spoken by the majority of the population. In its early history, Vietnamese writing used [[Chinese characters]] before a different meaning set of Chinese characters known as ''[[Chữ nôm]]'' developed between the 7th–13th century.{{sfn|Zwartjes|2011|p=292}}{{sfn|Choy|2013|p=340}}{{sfn|Dinh Tham|2018|p=67}} The folk epic {{lang|vi|[[The Tale of Kieu|Truyện Kiều]]}} ("The Tale of Kieu", originally known as {{lang|vi|Đoạn trường tân thanh}}) by [[Nguyễn Du]] was written in ''Chữ nôm''.{{sfn|Ozolinš|2016|p=130}} ''[[Quốc ngữ]]'' as the romanised Vietnamese alphabet used for spoken Vietnamese, was developed in the 17th century by the [[Jesuit]] [[Alexandre de Rhodes]] and several other Catholic missionaries by using the alphabets of [[Romance languages]], particularly the [[Portuguese alphabet]] which later became widely used through Vietnamese institutions during the French colonial period.{{sfn|Zwartjes|2011|p=292}}{{sfn|Jacques|1998|p=21}} Vietnam's minority groups speak a variety of languages, including [[Tày language|Tày]], [[Muong language|Mường]], [[Cham language|Cham]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Nung language (Tai)|Nùng]] and [[Hmong language|Hmong]]. The [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]] peoples of the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] also speak a number of distinct languages as their language is derived from both the Austroasiatic and [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] language groups.{{sfn|Cultural Orientation Resource Centre|p=10}} In recent years, a number of [[Vietnamese sign languages|sign languages]] have developed in the major cities.

The [[French language]], a legacy of colonial rule, is spoken by many educated Vietnamese as a second language, especially among the older generation and those educated in the former [[South Vietnam]], where it was a principal language in administration, education and commerce. Vietnam remains a full member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|International Organisation of the Francophonie]] (La Francophonie) and education has revived some interest in the language.{{sfn|French Senate|1997}} [[Russian language|Russian]] and to a much lesser extent [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Polish language|Polish]] are known among some northern Vietnamese whose families had ties with the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.{{sfn|Van Van|p=8}} With improved relations with Western countries and recent reforms in Vietnamese administration, [[English language|English]] has been increasingly used as a second language and the study of English is now obligatory in most schools either alongside or in place of French.{{sfn|Van Van|p=9}}{{sfn|United Kingdom Department for International Trade|2018}} The popularity of [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]] have also grown as the country's ties with other East Asian nations have strengthened.{{snf|Wai-ming|2002|p=3}}{{sfn|Anh Dinh|2016|p=63}}{{sfn|Hirano|2016}}

Vietnam's culture has developed over the centuries from indigenous ancient [[Đông Sơn culture]] with wet rice cultivation as its economic base.{{sfn|Higham|1984}}{{sfn|Calò|2009|p=51}} Some elements of the national culture have Chinese origins, drawing on elements of [[Confucianism]], Mahāyāna Buddhism and [[Taoism]] in its traditional political system and philosophy.{{sfn|Tung Hieu|2015|p=71}}{{sfn|Nhu Nguyen|2016|p=32}} Vietnamese society is structured around ''làng'' (ancestral villages);{{sfn|Endres|2001}} all Vietnamese mark a [[Giỗ Tổ Hùng Vương|common ancestral anniversary]] on the tenth day of the third [[lunar calendar|lunar month]].{{sfn|Grigoreva|2014|p=4}}{{sfn|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage|2012}} The influence of [[Chinese culture]] such as the [[Cantonese culture|Cantonese]], [[Hakka culture|Hakka]], [[Hokkien culture|Hokkien]] and [[Hainan]]ese cultures are more evidenced in the north with the national religion of Buddhism is strongly entwined with popular culture.{{sfn|Zhu|Ren|Collins|Warner|2017|p=142}} Despite this, there is also a [[Chinatown]] in the south such as in [[Chợ Lớn, Ho Chi Minh City|Chợ Lớn]] where many of the Chinese have [[interracial marriage|intermarried]] with Kinh and are presently indistinguishable among them.{{sfn|McLeod|Thi Dieu|2001|p=8}} In the central and southern part, traces of Champa and [[Khmer culture]] are evidenced through the remains of ruins, artefacts as well within their population as the successor of the ancient [[Sa Huỳnh culture]].{{sfn|Momoki|1996|p=36}}{{sfn|Kỳ Phương|Lockhart|2011|p=84}} In recent centuries, the influence of Western cultures have become popular among newer Vietnamese generations.{{sfn|Nhu Nguyen|2016|p=32}}

The traditional focuses of Vietnamese culture are based on humanity (''nhân nghĩa'') and harmony (''hòa''); in which family and community values are highly regarded.{{sfn|Zhu|Ren|Collins|Warner|2017|p=142}} Vietnam reveres a number of key cultural symbols,{{sfn|Vo|2012|p=96}} such as the [[Vietnamese dragon]] which is derived from [[crocodile]] and [[snake]] imagery; Vietnam's national father, [[Lạc Long Quân]] is depicted as a holy dragon.{{sfn|Grigoreva|2014|p=4}}{{sfn|Gallop|2017}}{{sfn|Vietnamese-American Association}} The ''lạc'' is a holy bird representing Vietnamese national mother of [[Âu Cơ]] is another prominent symbol, while [[turtle]], [[water buffalo|buffalo]] and [[horse]] images are also revered.{{sfn|Chonchirdsin|2016}} Many Vietnamese also believes in [[supernatural]] and [[spiritualism]] where illness could be brought on by a [[curse]] or [[witchcraft|sorcery]] or caused by non-observance of a religious ethic where it needs to be treated through traditional medical practitioners, [[amulet]]s and other forms of spiritual protection where religious practices may be employed to treating the ill person.{{sfn|Waitemata District Health Board|2015|p=2}} In the modern era, the cultural life of Vietnam has been deeply influenced by government-controlled media and cultural programs.{{sfn|Nhu Nguyen|2016|p=32}} For many decades, foreign cultural influences especially those of Western origin were shunned. But since the recent reformation, Vietnam has seen a greater exposure to neighbouring Southeast Asian, East Asian as well to Western culture and media.{{sfn|Phuong|2012}}

The main Vietnamese formal dress, the ''[[áo dài]]'' is worn for special occasions such as in weddings and religious festivals. White ''áo dài'' is the required uniform for girls in many high schools across the country. Other examples of traditional Vietnamese clothing include the ''[[áo tứ thân]]'', a four-piece woman's dress; the ''áo ngũ'', a form of the ''thân'' in 5-piece form, mostly worn in the north of the country; the ''[[yếm]]'', a woman's undergarment; the ''[[áo bà ba]]'', rural working "[[pyjamas]]" for men and women; the ''[[áo gấm]]'', a formal brocade tunic for government receptions; and the ''áo the'', a variant of the ''áo gấm'' worn by grooms at weddings.{{sfn|Lewandowski|2011|p=12}}{{sfn|Howard|2016|p=90}} Traditional headwear includes the standard conical ''[[nón lá]]'' and the "lampshade-like" ''[[nón quai thao]]''.{{sfn|Howard|2016|p=90}}{{sfn|Chico|2013|p=354}} In tourism, a number of popular cultural tourist destinations include the former imperial capital of Hué, the [[World Heritage Site]]s of [[Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park]], [[Hội An]] and [[Mỹ Sơn]], coastal regions such as Nha Trang, the caves of Hạ Long Bay and the [[Marble Mountains (Vietnam)|Marble Mountains]].{{sfn|Pha Le|2014}}{{sfn|Vietnam Net|2017a}}

Vietnamese literature has centuries-deep history and the country has a rich tradition of [[folk literature]] based on the typical 6–to-8-verse poetic form named ''ca dao'' which usually focuses on village ancestors and heroes.{{sfn|Huong|2010}} Written literature has been found dating back to the 10th century [[Ngô dynasty]], with notable ancient authors including [[Nguyễn Trãi]], [[Trần Hưng Đạo]], [[Nguyễn Du]] and [[Nguyễn Đình Chiểu]]. Some literary genres play an important role in theatrical performance, such as ''hát nói'' in ''[[ca trù]]''.{{sfn|Norton|2015}} Some poetic unions have also been formed in Vietnam, such as the ''tao đàn''. Vietnamese literature has in recent times been influenced by Western styles, with the first literary transformation movement of ''[[thơ mới]]'' emerging in 1932.{{sfn|Le|2008}} Vietnamese folk literature is an intermingling of many forms. It is not only an oral tradition, but a mixing of three media: hidden (only retained in the memory of folk authors), fixed (written), and shown (performed). Folk literature usually exist in many versions, passed down orally and have unknown authors. [[Myths]] consist of stories about supernatural beings, heroes, creator gods and reflect the viewpoint of ancient people about human life.{{sfn|Vo|2012|p=4}} They consist of creation stories, stories about their origins (''Lạc Long Quân'' and ''Âu Cơ''), [[culture heroes]] ([[Sơn Tinh – Thủy Tinh|''Sơn Tinh'' and ''Thủy Tinh'']]) which is referred as a mountain and water spirit respectively and many other folklore tales.{{sfn|McLeod|Thi Dieu|2001|p=8}}{{sfn|Tran|Le|2017|p=5}}

=== Music ===
{{main|Music of Vietnam}}

[[File:Ca trù performance.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ca trù]] trio performance in northern Vietnam]]
Traditional Vietnamese music varies between the country's northern and southern regions.{{sfn|van Khè|1972}} Northern classical music is Vietnam's oldest musical form and is traditionally more formal. The origins of Vietnamese classical music can be traced since the Mongol invasions in the 13th century when the Vietnamese captured a [[Chinese opera]] troupe.{{sfn|Miettinen|1992|p=163}} Throughout its history, Vietnamese has been the most heavily impacted by the [[Music of China|Chinese musical tradition]] as an integral part along with Japan, [[Korea]] and [[Mongolia]].{{sfn|Van Khê|1985}} ''[[Nhã nhạc]]'' is the most popular form of imperial court music, ''[[Chèo]]'' is a form of generally satirical [[musical theatre]] while ''[[Xẩm]]'' or ''hát xẩm'' (xẩm singing) is a type of Vietnamese [[folk music]]. ''[[Quan họ]]'' (alternate singing) is popular in the former [[Hà Bắc Province]] (which is now divided into [[Bắc Ninh Province|Bắc Ninh]] and [[Bắc Giang Province|Bắc Giang]] Provinces) and across Vietnam. Another form of music called ''[[Hat chau van|Hát chầu văn]]'' or ''hát văn'' is used to invoke spirits during ceremonies. ''[[Nhạc dân tộc cải biên]]'' is a modern form of Vietnamese [[folk music]] which arose in the 1950s while ''[[ca trù]]'' (also known as ''hát ả đào'') is a popular folk music. "Hò" can not be thought of as the southern style of ''quan họ''. There are a range of traditional instruments, including the ''[[đàn bầu]]'' (a monochord zither), the ''[[đàn gáo]]'' (a two-stringed fiddle with coconut body), and the ''[[đàn nguyệt]]'' (a two-stringed fretted moon lute. In recent times, there have been some efforts to mixing Vietnamese traditional music especially folk music with modern music to revive and promote national music in the modern context and educating the younger generations about Vietnam's traditional musical instruments and singing styles.{{sfn|Voice of Vietnam|2018d}}

[[Bolero#Vietnam|Bolero]] music has gained its position in the country since the 1930s, albeit with a different style from a combination between traditional Vietnamese music with Western elements.{{sfn|Duy|2016}} However, the modern Vietnamese music industry, known as [[V-pop]], is currently making its mark in the entertainment field. Many Vietnamese artists have started to collaborate with foreign artists and producers, especially South Korean, to facilitate the entrance of [[K-pop]] into the Vietnamese market while also promoting V-pop overseas.{{sfn|Chen|2018|p=194}} For example, in 2014, the South Korean seven-member [[boy band]] [[BTS (band)|BTS]] (방탄소년단) collaborated with Vietnamese singer [[North (band)|Thanh Bùi]] on the single called "[[Dark & Wild#Track listing|Danger]]".{{sfn|Chen|2018|p=194}}{{sfn|Yan News|2014}} In 2018, South Korean artist and idol [[Park Ji-yeon]] (박지연) collaborated with [[:vi:Soobin Hoàng Sơn|Soobin Hoàng Sơn]] in two versions of the title track called "Between Us" ({{lang-vi|Đẹp Nhất Là Em}}; {{lang-ko|우리사이}}) to promote the two countries’ partnership in terms of the music industry.{{sfn|Phương|2018}} [[V Live (website)|V Live]], which is a South Korean live video streaming service also collaborated with RBW Entertainment Vietnam (a subsidiary of [[RBW (company)|the Korean entertainment company]]) to produce Vietnamese-based shows. V Live also launched special monthly mini-concerts called "V Heartbeat Live" to connect V-pop and K-pop idols.{{sfn|Quốc Hoàng|2018}} Furthermore, South Korean entertainment company [[SM Entertainment]] signed an agreement with IPP Group to advance into the country's market and promote joint business.{{sfn|SM Entertainment Group|2018}} The company held its 2018 Global Audition in both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City in search for new talents among the Vietnamese youth.{{sfn|Dam-young|2018}}

=== Cuisine ===

[[File:Cuisine of Vietnam.jpg|thumb|right|Some of the notable Vietnamese cuisine, clockwise from top-right: [[phở|phở noodle]], chè thái fruit dessert, [[chả giò|chả giò spring roll]] and [[bánh mì|bánh mì sandwich]].]]
Vietnamese cuisine traditionally features a combination of five fundamental taste "elements" ([[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]]: ''ngũ vị''): spicy (metal), sour (wood), bitter (fire), salty (water) and sweet (earth).{{sfn|Vietnam Culture Information Network|2014}} Common ingredients include [[fish sauce]], [[shrimp paste]], [[soy sauce]], rice, fresh herbs, fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese recipes use [[cymbopogon|lemongrass]], [[ginger]], [[mentha|mint]], [[Vietnamese mint]], [[eryngium foetidum|long coriander]], [[Saigon cinnamon]], [[bird's eye chilli]], [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[basil]] leaves.{{sfn|Australia Special Broadcasting Service|2013}} Traditional Vietnamese cooking is known for its fresh ingredients, minimal use of oil and reliance on herbs and vegetables where it is considered one of the healthiest cuisines worldwide.{{sfn|Corapi|2010}} The use of such meats as pork, beef and chicken was relatively limited in the past, and as a result freshwater fish, [[crustacean]]s particularly [[crab]]s and [[mollusc]]s became widely used. Fish sauce, soy sauce, prawn sauce and limes are among the main flavouring ingredients. There is an estimate of 40 Vietnamese dishes with many are usually served as a norm in the country [[street food]] culture.{{sfn|Clark|Miller|2017}} Many notable Vietnamese dishes such as ''[[bánh cuốn]]'' (ride noodle roll), ''[[bún riêu]]'' (rice vermicelli soup) and ''[[phở]]'' noodles are originated from the north and were carried to central and southern Vietnam by northern migrants.{{sfn|Nguyen|2011}}{{sfn|Thaker|Barton|2012|p=170}} Local foods in the north are often less spicy than southern dishes as the colder northern climate limits the production and availability of spices.{{sfn|Williams|2017}} [[Black pepper]] is used in place of [[Chilli pepper|chillis]] to produce spicy flavours. Vietnamese drinks in the south also are usually served cold with [[ice cube]] especially during the annual hot seasons compared to the north where hot drinks are much more preferable in colder climate. Some examples of basic Vietnamese drinks include ''[[Vietnamese iced coffee|cà phê đá]]'' (Vietnamese iced coffee), ''[[egg coffee|cà phê trứng]]'' (egg coffee), ''[[chanh muối]]'' (salted pickled lime juice), ''[[cơm rượu]]'' (glutinous rice wine), ''[[nước mía]]'' (sugarcane juice) and ''[[Vietnamese lotus tea|trà sen]]'' (Vietnamese lotus tea).{{sfn|Batruny|2014}}

{{main|Media of Vietnam}}
[[File:Vietnam Television logo from 2013.svg|thumb|left|[[Vietnam Television]] (VTV), the main [[state television]]]]
Vietnam's media sector is regulated by the government in accordance with the 2004 Law on Publication.{{sfn|Vietnam National Assembly|2004}} It is generally perceived that the country media sector is controlled by the government to follow the official communist party line, though some newspapers are relatively outspoken.{{sfn|Xuan Dinh|2000}}{{sfn|Datta|Mendizabal|2018}} The [[Voice of Vietnam]] (VOV) is the official state-run national radio broadcasting service, broadcasting internationally via shortwave using rented transmitters in other countries and providing broadcasts from its website while [[Vietnam Television]] (VTV) is the national television broadcasting company. Since 1997, Vietnam has extensively regulated public [[internet]] access using both legal and technical means. The resulting lockdown is widely referred to as the "[[Internet censorship in Vietnam|Bamboo Firewall]]".{{sfn|Wilkey|2002}} The collaborative project [[OpenNet Initiative]] classifies Vietnam's level of online political censorship to be "pervasive",{{sfn|OpenNet Initiative|2012}} while [[Reporters Without Borders]] (RWB) considers Vietnam to be one of 15 global "internet enemies".{{sfn|Reporters Without Borders}} Though the government of Vietnam maintains that such censorship is necessary to safeguard the country against obscene or sexual explicit content, many political and religious sensitive websites that was deemed to be undermining state authority are also being blocked.{{sfn|Berkman Klein Center|2006}}

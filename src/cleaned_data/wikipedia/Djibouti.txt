It is bordered by [[Eritrea]] in the north, [[Ethiopia]] in the west and south, and [[Somalia]] in the southeast. The remainder of the border is formed by the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Gulf of Aden]] at the east. Djibouti occupies a total area of {{convert|8958|sqmi|km2|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref name=CIA/>

Djibouti has always been a very active member in the [[African Union]] and the [[Arab League]]{{Citation needed|date = March 2019}}.

In antiquity, the territory was part of the [[Land of Punt]] and then the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]. Nearby [[Zeila]] (now in [[Somalia]]) was the seat of the medieval [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] and [[Ifat Sultanate|Ifat]] Sultanates.

A decade later, the Djiboutian people voted for independence. This officially marked the establishment of the ''Republic of Djibouti'', named after its [[Djibouti (city)|capital city]]. Djibouti joined the United Nations the same year, on 20 September 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyorb.com/countries/djibouti |title=Today in Djibouti History |publisher=Historyorb.com |accessdate=27 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516125612/http://www.historyorb.com/countries/djibouti# |archive-date=16 May 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml#d |title=United Nations member states |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=27 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230101646/http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml#d#d |archive-date=30 December 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In the early 1990s, tensions over government representation led to [[Djiboutian Civil War|armed conflict]], which ended in a power-sharing agreement in 2000 between the ruling party and the opposition.<ref name=CIA/>

Djibouti is a multi-ethnic nation with a population of over {{UN_Population|Djibouti}} inhabitants. [[Somali language|Somali]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]] are the country's three official languages. About 94% of residents adhere to [[Islam]],<ref name=CIA/> which is the [[State religion|official religion]] and has been predominant in the region for more than a thousand years. The [[Somalis|Somali]] ([[Issa clan]]) and [[Afar people|Afar]] make up the two largest ethnic groups. Both speak [[Afroasiatic languages]].<ref name=CIA/>

Djibouti is strategically located near some of the world's busiest shipping lanes, controlling access to the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. It serves as a key refuelling and transshipment center, and is the principal maritime port for imports from and exports to neighboring Ethiopia. A burgeoning commercial hub, the nation is the site of various foreign military bases, including [[Camp Lemonnier]]. The [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] (IGAD) regional body also has its headquarters in Djibouti City.<ref name=CIA/>

==Name and etymology==
''Djibouti'' is officially known as the ''Republic of Djibouti''. In local languages it is known as ''Yibuuti'' (in [[Afar]]), ''جيبوتي, Jībūtī'' (in [[Arabic]]), and ''Jabuuti'' (in [[Somali language|Somali]]).

The name of the country is derived from the [[city of Djibouti]], the epynomous country's capital. The etymology of the city of Djibout is disputed. Several theories and legends exist regarding its origin, varying based on ethnicity. One theory derives it from the [[Afar]] word ''gabouti'', meaning "plate", possibly referring to the geographical features of the area.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Everett-Heath |first1=John |title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names (3 ed.) |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191751394.001.0001/acref-9780191751394-e-1858?rskey=VvZqhc&result=2481 |website=Oxford Reference |publisher=Oxford Reference |accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref> Another connects it to ''gabood'', meaning "upland/plateau".<ref name="culturetrip">{{cite web |last1=Boujrada |first1=Zineb |title=How Djibouti Got Its Unique Name |url=https://theculturetrip.com/africa/djibouti/articles/how-djibouti-got-its-unique-name/ |website=The Culture Trip |accessdate=4 March 2019 |date=2 March 2018}}</ref>

From 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the Gulf of Tadjoura was called "[[Obock Region|Obock]]". Under French administration, from 1883 to 1967 the area was known as [[French Somaliland]] (French: ''Côte française des Somalis''), and from 1967 to 1977 as the [[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]] (French: ''Territoire français des Afars et des Issas'').

Together with northern [[Somalia]], [[Eritrea]] and the [[Red Sea]] coast of [[Sudan]], Djibouti is considered the most likely location of the territory known to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians as ''[[Land of Punt|Punt]]'' (or ''Ta Netjeru'', meaning "God's Land").

Its [[Sultan]] Umar Walashma (or his son Ali, according to another source) is recorded as having conquered the [[Sultanate of Showa|Sultanate of Shewa]] in 1285. Taddesse Tamrat explains Sultan Umar's military expedition as an effort to consolidate the Muslim territories in the Horn, in much the same way as Emperor [[Yekuno Amlak]] was attempting to unite the Christian territories in the highlands during the same period. These two states inevitably came into conflict over Shewa and territories further south. A lengthy war ensued, but the Muslim sultanates of the time were not strongly unified. Ifat was finally defeated by Emperor [[Amda Seyon I]] of Ethiopia in 1332, and withdrew from Shewa.

According to I.M. Lewis, the polity was governed by local dynasties consisting of Somalized Arabs or Arabized Somalis, who also ruled over the similarly-established [[Sultanate of Mogadishu]] in the [[Benadir]] region to the south. Adal's history from this founding period forth would be characterized by a succession of battles with neighbouring [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]].<ref name="Lewispohoa"/> At its height, the Adal kingdom controlled large parts of modern-day Djibouti, Somalia, Eritrea and Ethiopia.

Governor Abou Baker ordered the Egyptian garrison at [[Sagallo]] to retire to [[Zeila]]. The cruiser Seignelay reached Sagallo shortly after the Egyptians had departed.

On 14 April 1884 the Commander of the patrol sloop L'Inferent reported on the Egyptian occupation in the Gulf of Tadjoura. The Commander of the patrol sloop Le Vaudreuil reported that the Egyptians were occupying the interior between [[Obock]] and [[Tadjoura]]. Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] of Ethiopia signed an accord with Great Britain to cease fighting the Egyptians and to allow the evacuation of Egyptian forces from [[Ethiopia]] and the Somalia littoral. The Egyptian garrison was withdrawn from [[Tadjoura]]. Léonce Lagarde deployed a patrol sloop to [[Tadjoura]] the following night.

From 1862 until 1894, the land to the north of the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] was called ''Obock'' and was ruled by [[Somali people|Somali]] and [[Afar people|Afar]] [[Sultan]]s, local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.<ref name="Uwechue"/><ref name="Apcoatf"/><ref name="EB1911_Somaliland_Hist"/> In 1894, [[Léonce Lagarde]] established a permanent French administration in the [[Djibouti (city)|city of Djibouti]] and named the region [[French Somaliland]]. It lasted from 1896 until 1967, when it was renamed the ''Territoire Français des Afars et des Issas'' (TFAI) ("[[French Territory of the Afars and the Issas]]").<ref>{{cite web |author=Cahoon, Ben |url=http://worldstatesmen.org/Djibouti.html |title=Djibouti |publisher=Worldstatesmen.org |accessdate=27 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110406110609/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Djibouti.html# |archive-date=6 April 2011 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1958, on the eve of neighboring Somalia's independence in 1960, a [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in Djibouti to decide whether to remain with France or to join the Somali Republic. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, partly due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pyWpKKlukLcC&pg=PA115 ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States''].

In 1967, a [[French Somaliland independence referendum, 1967|second plebiscite]] was held to determine the fate of the territory. Initial results supported a continued but looser relationship with France. Voting was also divided along ethnic lines, with the resident Somalis generally voting for independence, with the goal of eventual union with Somalia, and the Afars largely opting to remain associated with France.<ref name="Apcoatf"/> The referendum was again marred by reports of vote rigging on the part of the French authorities.<ref name="Aufsnas">American Universities Field Staff (1968) ''Northeast Africa series'', Volume 15, Issue 1, p. 3.</ref> In 1976, members of the [[Front de Libération de la Côte des Somalis]] also clashed with the Gendarmerie National Intervention Group over a bus hijacking en route to Loyada.<ref>{{cite book|title=Legion-Etrangere|year=2000|publisher=Legion-Etrangere|pages=2|url=http://2rep.legion-etrangere.com/|access-date=3 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730172224/http://2rep.legion-etrangere.com/#|archive-date=30 July 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Shortly after the plebiscite was held, the former ''Côte française des Somalis'' (French Somaliland) was renamed to ''Territoire français des Afars et des Issas''.<ref name="Tioipeami">Cottrell, Alvin J. and Burrell, Robert Michael (1972) ''The Indian Ocean: its political, economic, and military importance''.

===Djibouti Republic===
In 1977, a [[Afars and Issas independence referendum, 1977|third referendum]] took place. A landslide 98.8% of the electorate supported disengagement from France, officially marking Djibouti's independence.<ref name="Nwvol">''Newsweek'', Volume 81, (Newsweek: 1973), p. 254.</ref><ref>[http://africanelections.tripod.com/dj.html Elections in Djibouti] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102105012/http://africanelections.tripod.com/dj.html# |date=2 January 2017 }} African Elections Database</ref> [[Hassan Gouled Aptidon]], a Somali politician who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as the nation's first president (1977–1999).<ref name=Barrington2006/>

During its first year, Djibouti joined the [[Organization of African Unity]] (now the [[African Union]]), the [[Arab League]] and United Nations. In 1986, the nascent republic was also among the founding members of the [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development]] regional development organization.

In the early 1990s, tensions over government representation led to armed conflict between Djibouti's ruling [[People's Rally for Progress]] (PRP) party and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD) opposition group. The impasse ended in a power-sharing agreement in 2000.<ref name=CIA/>

== Politics ==
{{Further information|Politics of Djibouti}}

Djibouti is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], with [[executive power]] resting in the presidency, which is by turn dominant over the cabinet, and [[legislative power]] in both the government and the [[National Assembly (Djibouti)|National Assembly]].

=== Governance ===
[[File:Ismail Omar Guelleh 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|President of Djibouti, [[Ismaïl Omar Guelleh]].]]
The [[President of Djibouti|President]], currently [[Ismaïl Omar Guelleh]], is the prominent figure in Djiboutian politics; the [[head of state]] and [[commander-in-chief]]. The President exercises their executive power assisted by their appointee, the [[Prime Minister of Djibouti|Prime Minister]], currently [[Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed]]. The Council of Ministers (cabinet) is responsible to and presided over by the President.

The judicial system consists of courts of first instance, a High Court of Appeal, and a Supreme Court. The [[legal system]] is a blend of [[Civil law (legal system)|French civil law]] and [[customary law]] (''[[Xeer]]'') of the Somali and Afar peoples.<ref name="English_constitution">{{cite web|title=Djibouti's Constitution of 1992 with Amendments through 2010|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Djibouti_2010.pdf?lang=en|publisher=Constitute|accessdate=19 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625074422/https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Djibouti_2010.pdf?lang=en#|archive-date=25 June 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="constitution"/>

[[File:Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Abdoulkader Kamil Mohamed]], Prime Minister of Djibouti.]]
The [[Djiboutian parliamentary election, 2013|last election]] was held on 22 February 2013. Djibouti has a [[dominant-party system]], with the [[People's Rally for Progress]] (RPP) controlling the legislature and the executive since its foundation in 1979 (the party currently rules as a part of the [[Union for a Presidential Majority]], which currently holds a [[supermajority]] of seats). Opposition parties are allowed (limited) freedom, but the main opposition party, the [[Union for National Salvation]], boycotted the 2005 and 2008 elections, citing government control of the media and repression of the opposition candidates.<ref name=freedomhouse/>

The government is dominated by the Somali [[Issa (clan)|Issa]] [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] clan, who enjoy the support of the [[Somali clan]]s, especially the [[Gadabuursi]] [[Dir (clan)|Dir]] clan. The country emerged from a decade-long [[Djiboutian Civil War|civil war]] at the end of the 1990s, with the government and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (FRUD) signing a peace treaty in 2000. Two FRUD members subsequently joined the cabinet,<ref name=CIA/> and beginning with [[Djiboutian presidential election, 1999|the presidential elections of 1999]], the FRUD has campaigned in support of the RPP.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main article|Foreign relations of Djibouti}}
[[File:DjiboutiNationalAssembly.JPG|thumb|The Djibouti National Assembly in Djibouti City.]]
Foreign relations of Djibouti are managed by the Djiboutian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. Djibouti maintains close ties with the governments of [[Somalia]], [[Ethiopia]], France and the United States. Ties with Somalia are especially close, as Djiboutian Somalis often identify themselves with their brethren to the south. Relations with [[Eritrea]] are tense due to territorial claims over the [[Ras Doumeira]] peninsula. Since the 2000s, the Djiboutian authorities have strengthened ties with China. Djibouti is likewise an active participant in [[Arab League]] and [[African Union]] affairs.

===Human rights===
{{Main article|Human rights in Djibouti}}
In its 2011 Freedom in the World report, [[Freedom House]] ranked Djibouti as "Not Free", a downgrading from its former status as "Partly Free".

There are occasional reports of police beating prisoners. [[Reporters Without Borders]] claims that Dirir Ibrahim Bouraleh died from injuries sustained under torture by Sergeant Major Abdourahman Omar Said from 23–27 April 2011. Conditions in the jails are considered worse, with no formal system of care.

=== Military ===
{{main article|Djibouti Armed Forces}}
[[File:Camp Maryama during an exercise, Arta Region, Djibouti.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Maryama base during a martial exercise in the [[Arta Region]].]]
The [[Djibouti Armed Forces]] include the Djibouti National Army, which consists of the Coastal Navy, the Djiboutian Air Force (Force Aerienne Djiboutienne, FAD), and the National Gendarmerie (GN). {{As of|2011}}, the manpower available for military service was 170,386 males and 221,411 females aged 16 to 49.<ref name=CIA/> Djibouti [[List of countries by military expenditures|spent]] over US$36&nbsp;million annually on its military {{As of|2011|lc=y}} (141st in the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute|SIPRI]] database). After independence, Djibouti had two regiments commanded by French officers. In the early 2000s, it looked outward for a model of army organization that would best advance defensive capabilities by restructuring forces into smaller, more mobile units instead of traditional divisions.

The first war which involved the Djiboutian Armed Forces was the [[Djiboutian Civil War]] between the Djiboutian government, supported by France, and the [[Front for the Restoration of Unity and Democracy]] (''FRUD''). The war lasted from 1991 to 2001, although most of the hostilities ended when the moderate factions of FRUD signed a peace treaty with the government after suffering an extensive military setback when the government forces captured most of the rebel-held territory. A radical group continued to fight the government, but signed its own peace treaty in 2001. The war ended in a government victory, and FRUD became a political party.

In recent years, Djibouti has improved its training techniques, military command and information structures and has taken steps to becoming more self-reliant in supplying its military to collaborate with the United Nations in peacekeeping missions, or to provide military help to countries that officially ask for it.

Djibouti's strategic location by the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] Strait, which separates the [[Gulf of Aden]] from the [[Red Sea]] and controls the approaches to the [[Suez Canal]], has made it a desirable location for foreign military bases. [[Camp Lemonnier]] was abandoned by the French

===Military Presence in Djibouti===
China has, in recent times, stepped up its military presence in Africa, with ongoing plans to secure an even greater military presence in Djibouti specifically. China's presence in Djibouti is tied to strategic ports to ensure the security of Chinese assets. Djibouti's strategic location makes the country prime for an increased military presence.<ref name="Nyska">{{cite web |last1=Chandran |first1=Nyshka |title=China increases defense ties with Africa |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/china-increases-defence-ties-with-africa.html |website=www.cnbc.com |date=27 June 2018}}</ref>

Djibouti is situated in the [[Horn of Africa]] on the [[Gulf of Aden]] and the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], at the southern entrance to the [[Red Sea]]. It lies between latitudes 10° and 13°N and longitudes 41° and 44°E, at the tripoint of the [[Somali Plate]], African Plate and [[Arabian Plate]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1029/96JB01185|title=Propagation of rifting along the Arabia‐Somalia plate boundary: The gulfs of Aden and Tadjoura|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth|volume=102|pages=2681–2710|year=1997|last1=Manighetti|first1=Isabelle|last2=Tapponnier|first2=Paul|last3=Courtillot|first3=Vincent|last4=Gruszow|first4=Sylvie|last5=Gillot|first5=Pierre-Yves}}</ref>

The country's coastline stretches {{convert|403|km|0|abbr=off}}, with terrain consisting mainly of plateau, plains and highlands. Djibouti has a total area of {{convert|23200|km2|sqmi|sigfig=1}}. Its borders extend {{convert|528|km|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|125|km|0|abbr=on}} of which are shared with [[Eritrea]], {{convert|342|km|0|abbr=on}} with [[Ethiopia]], and {{convert|61|km|0|abbr=on}} with [[Somalia]].<ref name=CIA/> Djibouti is the southernmost [[Arabian Plate country|country on the Arabian Plate]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Geothermal Resources Council|title=1985 International Symposium on Geothermal Energy, Volume 9, Part 1|date=1985|page=175}}</ref>

Djibouti has eight mountain ranges with peaks of over {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=off}}.<ref name="Hmid">[http://www.geonames.org/DJ/highest-mountains-in-djibouti.html Highest Mountains in Djibouti] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016124008/http://www.geonames.org/DJ/highest-mountains-in-djibouti.html# |date=16 October 2013 }}. geonames.org</ref> The [[Mousa Ali]] range is considered the country's highest mountain range, with the tallest peak on the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea. It has an elevation of {{convert|2028|m|ft|abbr=off}}.<ref name="Hmid"/> The [[Grand Bara]] desert covers parts of southern Djibouti in the Arta, Ali Sabieh and Dikhil regions. The majority of it sits at a relatively low elevation, below {{convert|1700|ft|m||abbr=off}}.

Extreme geographic points include: to the north, Ras Doumera and the point at which the border with Eritrea enters the Red Sea in the Obock Region; to the east, a section of the Red Sea coast north of Ras Bir; to the south, a location on the border with Ethiopia west of the town of [[As Ela]]; and to the west, a location on the frontier with Ethiopia immediately east of the Ethiopian town of [[Afambo (woreda)|Afambo]].

Most of Djibouti is part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]]. The exception is an eastern strip located along the Red Sea coast, which is part of the [[Eritrean coastal desert]].<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|name=Eritrean coastal desert|id=at1304}}</ref>

Djibouti's [[climate]] is significantly warmer and has significantly less seasonal variation than the world average. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from {{convert|32|to|41|°C|°F}}, except at high elevations, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. In [[Djibouti city]], for instance, average afternoon highs range from {{convert|28|to|34|°C|°F}} in April. Nationally, mean daily minimums usually vary from {{convert|15|to|30|°C|°F}}.<ref name="climate">{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/city.php3?c=DJ&name=Djibouti |title=Weatherbase : Djibouti |accessdate=1 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905100532/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/city.php3?c=DJ&name=Djibouti# |archive-date=5 September 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The greatest range in climate occurs in eastern Djibouti, where temperatures sometimes surpass {{convert|41|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July on the littoral plains and the freezing point during December in the highlands.<ref name="climate"/> In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40% in the mid-afternoon to 85% at night, changing somewhat according to the season.

Djibouti's climate ranges from arid in the northeastern coastal regions to [[semiarid]] in the central, northern, western and southern parts of the country. On the eastern seaboard, annual rainfall is less than 5 inches (131&nbsp;mm); in the central highlands, precipitation is about 8 to 16 inches (200 to 400&nbsp;mm). The hinterland is significantly less humid than the coastal regions. The coast has the mildest climates in Djibouti.
The 2015 Djibouti climate change bill has set a goal for the country to generate 100% of its energy from clean renewable energy sources by 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/news/djibouti_to_source_100_of_its_energy_from_renewables_by_2020|title=Djibouti to source 100% of its energy from renewables by 2020|publisher=climateactionprogramme.org|accessdate=29 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720233019/http://www.climateactionprogramme.org/news/djibouti_to_source_100_of_its_energy_from_renewables_by_2020#|archive-date=20 July 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Goda Mountains - National Park of Forêt du Day.jpg|thumb|left|Plant species on the [[Day Forest National Park|Forêt du Day National Park]].]]
Most species of wildlife are found in the northern part of the country, in the ecosystem of the [[Day Forest National Park]]. At an average altitude of {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off}}, the area includes the Goda massif, with a peak of {{convert|1783|m|0|abbr=on}}. It covers an area of {{convert|3.5|km2|0|abbr=out}} of [[Juniperus procera]] forest, with many of the trees rising to {{convert|20|m|0|abbr=off}} height. This forest area is the main habitat of the endangered and endemic [[Djibouti francolin]] (a bird), and another recently noted vertebrate, ''Platyceps afarensis'' (a [[colubrine]] snake). It also contains many species of woody and herbaceous plants, including boxwood and olive trees, which account for 60% of the total identified species in the country.

According to the country profile related to biodiversity of wildlife in Djibouti, the nation contains more than 820 species of plants, 493 species of invertebrates, 455 species of fish, 40 species of reptiles, 3 species of amphibians, 360 species of birds and 66 species of mammals.<ref name=day/> Wildlife of Djibouti is also listed as part of [[Horn of Africa]] [[biodiversity hotspot]] and the [[Red Sea]] and [[Gulf of Aden]] [[coral reef]] hotspot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lntreasures.com/djibouti.html|title=Djibouti|accessdate=27 February 2013|publisher=Living National Treasures|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803140824/http://lntreasures.com/djibouti.html#|archive-date=3 August 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
Mammals include several species of antelope, such as Soemmerring's gazelle and Pelzeln's gazelle. As a result of the hunting ban imposed since early 1970 these species are well conserved now. Other characteristic mammals are [[Grevy's zebra]], [[hamadryas baboon]] and [[Hunter's antelope]]. The [[warthog]], a vulnerable species, is also found in the Day National park. The coastal waters have dugongs and [[Abyssinian genet]]; the latter needs confirmation by further studies. [[Green turtle]]s and [[hawksbill turtle]]s are in the coastal waters where nestling also takes place.<ref name="Resourcesutviklingshjelp1989">{{cite book|author1=International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources|author2=Norway.

==Economy==
{{main article|Economy of Djibouti}}
[[File:GDP by sector, Djibouti.png|thumb|250px|Djibouti GDP by sector]]
Djibouti's economy is largely concentrated in the service sector. Commercial activities revolve around the country's free trade policies and strategic location as a Red Sea transit point. Due to limited rainfall, vegetables and fruits are the principal production crops, and other food items require importation. The GDP (purchasing power parity) in 2013 was estimated at $2.505&nbsp;billion, with a real growth rate of 5% annually. Per capita income is around $2,874 (PPP). The services sector constituted around 79.7% of the GDP, followed by industry at 17.3%, and agriculture at 3%.<ref name=CIA/>

{{As of|2013}}, the container terminal at the [[Port of Djibouti]] handles the bulk of the nation's trade. About 70% of the seaport's activity consists of imports to and exports from neighboring [[Ethiopia]], which depends on the harbour as its main maritime outlet. The port also serves as an international refueling center and transshipment hub.<ref name=CIA/> In 2012, the Djiboutian government in collaboration with DP World started construction of the Doraleh Container Terminal,<ref name="Cdpafoid">{{cite web|author=Bansal, Ridhima|title=Current Development Projects and Future Opportunities in Djibouti|url=http://www.aaeafrica.org/start/current-development-projects-and-future-opportunities-in-djibouti/|publisher=Association of African Entrepreneurs|accessdate=26 February 2013|date=23 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327074151/http://www.aaeafrica.org/start/current-development-projects-and-future-opportunities-in-djibouti/#|archive-date=27 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> a third major seaport intended to further develop the national transit capacity.<ref name=CIA/> A $396&nbsp;million project, it has the capacity to accommodate 1.5&nbsp;million twenty foot container units annually.<ref name="Cdpafoid"/>

The government has also introduced new private sector policies targeting high interest and inflation rates, including relaxing the tax burden on enterprises and allowing exemptions on consumption tax.<ref name="Cdpafoid"/>
[[File:Tree map export 2009 Djibouti.jpeg|thumb|250px|left|A proportional representation of Djibouti's exports.]]
Additionally, efforts have been made to lower the estimated 60% urban unemployment rate by creating more job opportunities through investment in diversified sectors. Funds have especially gone toward building telecommunications infrastructure and increasing disposable income by supporting small businesses. Owing to its growth potential, the fishing and agro-processing sector, which represents around 15% of GDP, has also enjoyed rising investment since 2008.<ref name="Cdpafoid"/>

To expand the modest industrial sector, a 56 megawatt geothermal power plant slated to be completed by 2018 is being constructed with the help of [[OPEC]], the [[World Bank]] and the [[Global Environmental Facility]]. The facility is expected to solve the recurring electricity shortages, decrease the nation's reliance on Ethiopia for energy, reduce costly oil imports for diesel-generated electricity, and thereby buttress the GDP and lower debt.<ref name="Cdpafoid"/>

The Djibouti firm Salt Investment (SIS) began a large-scale operation to industrialize the plentiful salt in Djibouti's [[Lake Assal (Djibouti)|Lake Assal]] region. Operating at an annual capacity of 4 million tons, the desalination project has lifted export revenues, created more job opportunities, and provided more fresh water for the area's residents.<ref name=CIA/><ref name="Cdpafoid"/> In 2012, the Djibouti government also enlisted the services of the China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd for the construction of an ore terminal.

Djibouti's gross domestic product expanded by an average of more than 6 percent per year, from US$341&nbsp;million in 1985 to US$1.5&nbsp;billion in 2015. The [[Djiboutian franc]] is the currency of Djibouti. It is issued by the [[Central Bank of Djibouti]], the country's [[monetary authority]].

{{As of|2010}}, 10 conventional and Islamic banks operate in Djibouti.

[[File:The Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport.png|thumb|right|Main Terminal at [[Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport]].]]
The [[Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport]] in [[Djibouti City]], the country's only international airport, serves many intercontinental routes with scheduled and chartered flights. [[Air Djibouti]] is the flag carrier of Djibouti and is the country's largest airline.

The new and electrified [[standard gauge]] [[Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway]] started operation in January 2018. Its main purpose is to facilitate freight services between the Ethiopian hinterland and the Djiboutian [[Port of Doraleh]]. 

Car ferries pass the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] from Djibouti City to [[Tadjoura]]. There is the [[Port of Doraleh]] west of Djibouti City, which is the main port of Djibouti. The Port of Doraleh is the terminal of the new Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In addition to the Port of Doraleh, which handles general cargo and oil imports, Djibouti currently (2018) has three other major ports for the import and export of bulk goods and livestock, the [[Tadjoura|Port of Tadjourah]] (potash), the [[Damerjog|Damerjog Port]] (livestock) and the [[Port of Goubet]] (salt). Almost 95 % of Ethiopia's imports and exports move through Djiboutian ports. 

The Djiboutian highway system is named according to the road classification. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they carry traffic between all the major towns in Djibouti.

At 2015, per capita annual electricity consumption is about 330 kilowatt-hours (kWh); moreover, about 45% of the population does not have access to electricity,<ref name=oxford/> and the level of unmet demand in the country's power sector is significant. Increased [[hydropower]] imports from [[Ethiopia]], which currently satisfies 65% of Djibouti's demand, will play a significant role in boosting the country's renewable energy supply.<ref name=oxford/> The geothermal potential has generated particular interest in Japan, with 13 potential sites; they have already started the construction on one site near Lake Assal. The construction of the photovoltaic power station (solar farms) in Grand Bara will generated 50 MW capacity.

Arabic is of religious importance. In formal settings, it consists of [[Modern Standard Arabic]]. Colloquially, about 59,000 local residents speak the [[Ta'izzi-Adeni Arabic]] dialect, also known as ''Djibouti Arabic''. French serves as a statutory national language. It was inherited from the colonial period, and is the primary language of instruction. Around 17,000 Djiboutians speak it as a first language. Immigrant languages include [[Omani Arabic]] (38,900 speakers), [[Amharic]] (1,400 speakers), [[Greek language|Greek]] (1,000 speakers) and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] (600 speakers).<ref name="ethnologue.com"/>

Islam entered the region very early on, as a group of persecuted Muslims had sought refuge across the [[Red Sea]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] at the urging of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]. In 1900, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no Christians in the territories, with only about 100–300 followers coming from the schools and orphanages of the few Catholic missions in the [[French Somaliland]]. The Constitution of Djibouti names Islam as the sole [[state religion]], and also provides for the equality of citizens of all faiths (Article 1) and freedom of religious practice (Article 11).<ref name="English_constitution"/><ref name="constitution"/> Most local Muslims adhere to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] denomination, following the [[Shafi'i]] school.

=== Education ===
{{main article|Education in Djibouti}}
Education is a priority for the government of Djibouti. {{As of|2009}}, it allocates 20.5% of its annual budget to scholastic instruction.<ref name="infodev.org">Hare, Harry (2007) [http://www.infodev.org/en/Publication.398.html ICT in Education in Djibouti] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091216081516/http://www.infodev.org/en/Publication.398.html# |date=16 December 2009 }}, World Bank</ref>

[[File:Djibwomglopul.jpeg|thumb|Djiboutian women participating in the Global Pulse educational initiative (2010).]]
The Djiboutian educational system was initially formulated to cater to a limited pupil base. As such, the schooling framework was largely elitist and drew considerably from the French colonial paradigm, which was ill-suited to local circumstances and needs.<ref name="infodev.org"/>

In the late 1990s, the Djiboutian authorities revised the national educational strategy and launched a broad-based consultative process involving administrative officials, teachers, parents, national assembly members and NGOs. The initiative identified areas in need of attention and produced concrete recommendations on how to go about improving them. The government subsequently prepared a comprehensive reform plan aimed at modernizing the educational sector over the 2000–10 period. In August 2000, it passed an official Education Planning Act and drafted a medium-term development plan for the next five years. The fundamental academic system was significantly restructured and made compulsory; it now consists of five years of primary school and four years of middle school. Secondary schools also require a Certificate of Fundamental Education for admission. In addition, the new law introduced secondary-level vocational instruction and established university facilities in the country.<ref name="infodev.org"/>

As a result of the Education Planning Act and the medium-term action strategy, substantial progress has been registered throughout the educational sector.<ref name="infodev.org"/> In particular, school enrollment, attendance, and retention rates have all steadily increased, with some regional variation. From 2004 to 2005 to 2007–08, net enrollments of girls in primary school rose by 18.6%; for boys, it increased 8.0%. Net enrollments in middle school over the same period rose by 72.4% for girls and 52.2% for boys. At the secondary level, the rate of increase in net enrollments was 49.8% for girls and 56.1% for boys.<ref name="Datee">[http://eastafrica.usaid.gov/documents/document/document/1368 Djibouti Assistance to Education Evaluation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112235926/http://eastafrica.usaid.gov/documents/document/document/1368 |date=12 November 2012 }}. USAID (April 2009)</ref>

The Djiboutian government has especially focused on developing and improving institutional infrastructure and teaching materials, including constructing new classrooms and supplying textbooks. At the post-secondary level, emphasis has also been placed on producing qualified instructors and encouraging out-of-school youngsters to pursue vocational training.<ref name="infodev.org"/> {{As of|2012}}, the literacy rate in Djibouti was estimated at 70%.<ref name="Pcaotw">{{cite book|title=Compact Atlas of the World|year=2012|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0756698591|page=138|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=pLw-ReHIgvQC|access-date=20 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011033725/http://www.google.com/books?id=pLw-ReHIgvQC#|archive-date=11 October 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Djiboutian attire reflects the region's hot and arid climate. When not dressed in Western clothing such as jeans and T-shirts, men typically wear the ''macawiis'', which is a traditional [[sarong]]-like garment worn around the waist. Many nomadic people wear a loosely wrapped white cotton robe called a ''tobe'' that goes down to about the knee, with the end thrown over the shoulder (much like a Roman [[toga]]).

Women typically wear the ''dirac'', which is a long, light, diaphanous [[voile]] dress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a full-length [[Slip (clothing)|half-slip]] and a bra. Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as ''shash'' and often cover their upper body with a [[shawl]] known as ''garbasaar''. Unmarried or young women, however, do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb such as the male [[jellabiya]] (''jellabiyaad'' in Somali) and the female [[jilbāb]] is also commonly worn. For some occasions such as festivals, women may adorn themselves with specialized jewelry and head-dresses similar to those worn by the [[Berber people|Berber]] tribes of the [[Maghreb]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Image of Djibouti women in head-dresses |url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Images/Places/Djibouti/Women_Costumes_Djibouti.jpg |publisher=discoverfrance.net |access-date=31 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614075753/http://www.discoverfrance.net/Colonies/Images/Places/Djibouti/Women_Costumes_Djibouti.jpg# |archive-date=14 June 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A lot of Djibouti's original art is passed on and preserved orally, mainly through song. Many examples of Islamic, Ottoman, and French influences can also be noted in the local buildings, which contain plasterwork, carefully constructed [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]], and [[calligraphy]].

===Music===
{{Main article|Music of Djibouti}}
[[File:Oud - MIM PHX.jpg|thumb|180px|The [[oud]] is a common instrument in traditional Djibouti music.]]
Somalis have a rich musical heritage centered on traditional Somali [[folklore]]. Most Somali songs are [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]. That is, they only use five [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] per [[octave]] in contrast to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] (seven note) scale such as the [[major scale]]. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, [[Sudan]] or the [[Arabian Peninsula]], but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists (''midho''), songwriters (''laxan'') and singers (''codka'' or "voice"). [[Balwo]] is a Somali musical style centered on love themes that is popular in Djibouti.<ref>Abdullahi, Mohamed Diriye (2001) ''Culture and Customs of Somalia''. Greenwood Press. pp. 170–172. {{ISBN|9780313313332}}</ref>

Traditional Afar music resembles the folk music of other parts of the [[Horn of Africa]] such as [[Music of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]]; it also contains elements of [[Arabic music]]. The history of Djibouti is recorded in the poetry and songs of its nomadic people, and goes back thousands of years to a time when the peoples of Djibouti traded hides and skins for the perfumes and spices of ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]] and China. Afar oral literature is also quite musical. It comes in many varieties, including songs for weddings, war, praise and boasting.<ref name="expedition">{{cite web|url=http://expedition.bensenville.lib.il.us/Africa/Djibouti/culture.htm |title=Djibouti – Culture Overview|work=Expedition Earth|accessdate=28 September 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040227041820/http://expedition.bensenville.lib.il.us/Africa/Djibouti/culture.htm |archivedate = 27 February 2004}} – ''Website no longer exists; link is to [[Internet Archive]]''</ref>

===Literature===
{{Main article|Literature of Djibouti}}
Djibouti has a long tradition of poetry. Several well-developed Somali forms of verse include the ''gabay'', ''jiifto'', ''geeraar'', ''wiglo'', ''buraanbur'', ''beercade'', ''afarey'' and ''guuraw''. The gabay (epic poem) has the most complex length and meter, often exceeding 100 lines. It is considered the mark of poetic attainment when a young poet is able to compose such verse, and is regarded as the height of poetry. Groups of memorizers and reciters (''hafidayaal'') traditionally propagated the well-developed art form. Poems revolve around several main themes, including ''baroorodiiq'' (elegy), ''amaan'' (praise), ''jacayl'' (romance), ''guhaadin'' (diatribe), ''digasho'' (gloating) and ''guubaabo'' (guidance). The baroorodiiq is composed to commemorate the death of a prominent poet or figure.<ref name=Abdullahi75>Abdullahi, Mohamed Diriye (2001) ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', Greenwood Press. pp. 75–76. {{ISBN|9780313313332}}</ref> The Afar are familiar with the ''ginnili'', a kind of warrior-poet and diviner, and have a rich oral tradition of folk stories. They also have an extensive repertoire of battle songs.<ref name="Phillips">Phillips, Matt and Carillet, Jean-Bernard (2006) ''Lonely Planet Ethiopia and Eritrea'', Lonely Planet. p. 301. {{ISBN|9781741044362}}</ref>

Additionally, Djibouti has a long tradition of Islamic literature. Among the most prominent historical works is the medieval ''Futuh Al-Habash'' by Shihāb al-Dīn, which chronicles the [[Adal Sultanate]] army's [[Ethiopian-Adal War|conquest of Abyssinia]] during the 16th century.<ref name="Shihab">{{cite book|author=Shihāb al-Dīn Aḥmad ibn ʻAbd al-Qādir ʻArabfaqīh, Translated by Paul Stenhouse, Richard Pankhurst|title=The conquest of Abyssinia: 16th century|year=2003|publisher=Tsehai Publishers & Distributors|page=77|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgIwAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> In recent years, a number of politicians and intellectuals have also penned memoirs or reflections on the country.

===Sport===
Football is the most popular sport amongst Djiboutians. The country became a member of [[FIFA]] in 1994, but has only taken part in the qualifying rounds for the [[African Cup of Nations]] as well as the [[FIFA World Cup]] in the mid-2000s. In November 2007, the [[Djibouti national football team]] beat [[Somalia national football team|Somalia's national squad]] 1–0 in the qualification rounds for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], marking its first ever World Cup-related win.
Recently, new sports are developing and being introduced, such as [[Archery]]. [[World Archery Federation]] has helped to implement the Djibouti Archery Federation, and an international archery training center is being created in [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]] to support archery development in East Africa and Red Sea area.

===Cuisine===
{{Main article|Djiboutian cuisine}}
[[File:Sambusadish.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of ''[[samosa|sambusas]]'' a popular traditional snack.]]
[[Djiboutian cuisine]] is a mixture of [[Somali cuisine|Somali]], [[Afar people|Afar]], [[Yemeni cuisine|Yemeni]], and [[French cuisine]], with some additional [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] (especially [[Indian cuisine|Indian]]) culinary influences. Local dishes are commonly prepared using a lot of Middle Eastern spices, ranging from [[saffron]] to [[cinnamon]]. Grilled Yemeni fish, opened in half and often cooked in tandoori style ovens, are a local delicacy. Spicy dishes come in many variations, from the traditional ''Fah-fah'' or "''Soupe Djiboutienne''" (spicy boiled beef soup), to the ''yetakelt wet'' (spicy mixed vegetable stew). ''Xalwo'' (pronounced "halwo") or [[halva]] is a popular confection eaten during festive occasions, such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions. Halva is made from sugar, [[corn starch]], [[cardamom]] powder, [[nutmeg]] powder and [[ghee]]. Peanuts are sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor.<ref>Ali, Barlin (2007) ''Somali Cuisine''. AuthorHouse. p. 79. {{ISBN|9781425977061}}</ref> After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[incense]] (''cuunsi'') or [[frankincense]] (''lubaan''), which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''.

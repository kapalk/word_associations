Azerbaijan's regime is a curious hybrid, in which semi-presidential institutions operate in the larger context of authoritarianism. The author compares formal Constitutional provisions with the practice of politics in the country, suggesting that formal and informal sources of authority come together to enhance the effective powers of the presidency. In addition to the considerable formal powers laid out in the Constitution, Azerbaijan's president also benefits from the support of the ruling party and informal family and patronage networks. LaPorte concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of this symbiosis between formal and informal institutions in Azerbaijan's semi-presidential regime. |ref=harv }}</ref>

The [[Sasanian Empire]] turned [[Caucasian Albania]] into a [[vassal state]] in 252, while King [[Urnayr]] officially adopted [[Christianity]] as the state religion in the 4th century{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Despite Sassanid rule, [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] remained an entity in the region until the 9th century, while fully subordinate to Sassanid Iran, and retained its monarchy. Despite being one of the chief vassals of the Sasanian emperor, the Albanian king had only a semblance of authority, and the Sasanian [[marzban]] (military governor) held most civil, religious, and military authority.

In the first half of the 7th century, [[Caucasian Albania]], as a vassal of the Sasanians, came under nominal Muslim rule due to the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. The [[Umayyad Caliphate]] repulsed both the Sasanians and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] from [[Transcaucasia]] and turned [[Caucasian Albania]] into a vassal state after Christian resistance led by King [[Javanshir]], was suppressed in 667. The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid dynasty|Sallarids]], [[Sajid dynasty|Sajids]], and [[Shaddadids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Oghuz Turks]] from [[Central Asia]]. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the [[Seljuk Empire]], who entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.

The pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijan spoke several [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and Caucasian languages, among them [[Armenian language|Armenian]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hewsen |first1=Robert H. |last2=Salvatico |first2=Christoper C. |title=Armenia: A Historical Atlas |date=2001 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226332284 |url=https://books.google.ca/books/about/Armenia.html?id=ZfZBrFza_IYC |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Samuelian |first1=Thomas J. |title=Hewsen, Robert H.

</ref> Locally, the possessions of the subsequent Seljuk Empire were ruled by [[Eldiguzids]], technically vassals of the Seljuk sultans, but sometimes ''de facto'' rulers themselves. Under the Seljuks, local poets such as [[Nizami Ganjavi]] and [[Khaqani]] gave rise to a blossoming of [[Persian literature]] on the territory of present-day Azerbaijan.

The local dynasty of the [[Shirvanshah]]s became a [[vassal]] state of [[Timurid dynasty|Timur's Empire]], and assisted him in his war with the ruler of the [[Golden Horde]] [[Tokhtamysh]]. Following Timur's death, two independent and rival states emerged: [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu]]. The Shirvanshahs returned, maintaining a high degree of autonomy as local rulers and vassals from 861, for numerous centuries to come. In 1501, the [[Safavid dynasty]] of Iran subdued the Shirvanshahs, and gained its possessions.

The Sunni Ottomans briefly managed to occupy parts of present-day Azerbaijan as a result of the [[Ottoman-Safavid War (1578-1590)|Ottoman-Safavid War of 1578–1590]]; by the early 17th century, they were ousted by Safavid Iranian ruler [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (r. 1588–1629).

On 13 October 1921, the Soviet republics of Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia signed an agreement with Turkey known as the [[Treaty of Kars]]. The previously independent [[Republic of Aras]] would also become the [[Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] within the Azerbaijan SSR by the treaty of Kars. On the other hand, [[Armenia]] was awarded the region of [[Syunik Province|Zangezur]] and Turkey agreed to return [[Gyumri]] (then known as Alexandropol).

During [[World War II]], Azerbaijan played a crucial role in the strategic energy policy of the Soviet Union, with 80 percent of the Soviet Union's oil on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] being supplied by Baku.

Since the independence of Azerbaijan in 1991, the [[Politics of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani government]] has taken measures to preserve the environment of Azerbaijan.

The formation of climate in Azerbaijan is influenced particularly by cold [[arctic]] [[air mass]]es of Scandinavian [[anticyclone]], temperate air masses of [[Siberia]]n anticyclone, and Central Asian anticyclone.<ref name="CLIM">{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan – Climate| publisher = Heydar Aliyev Foundation| url = http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Climate/_climate_e.html| accessdate = 26 May 2007}}</ref> Azerbaijan's diverse landscape affects the ways air masses enter the country.<ref name="CLIM"/> The Greater Caucasus protects the country from direct influences of cold air masses coming from the north. That leads to the formation of [[Subtropics|subtropical climate]] on most foothills and plains of the country. Meanwhile, plains and foothills are characterized by high [[Sunlight|solar radiation]] rates.

Rivers and lakes form the principal part of the water systems of Azerbaijan, they were formed over a long geological timeframe and changed significantly throughout that period. This is particularly evidenced by remnants of ancient rivers found throughout the country. The country's water systems are continually changing under the influence of natural forces and human introduced industrial activities. Artificial rivers (canals) and ponds are a part of Azerbaijan's water systems. In terms of water supply, Azerbaijan is below the average in the world with approximately {{convert|100000|m3|0|abbr=off}} per year of water per square kilometer.<ref name="KL"/> All big [[Reservoir|water reservoirs]] are built on Kur. The hydrography of Azerbaijan basically belongs to the [[Caspian Sea basin]].

There are 8,350 rivers of various lengths within Azerbaijan. Only 24 rivers are over 100&nbsp;kilometers long.<ref>{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan: Geography| publisher = Central Asia and Caucasus Institute| url = http://www.cac-biodiversity.org/aze/aze_geography.htm}}</ref> The [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura]] and [[Aras River|Aras]] are the major rivers in Azerbaijan, they run through the [[Kura-Aras Lowland]]. The rivers that directly flow into the Caspian Sea, originate mainly from the north-eastern slope of the Major Caucasus and [[Talysh Mountains]] and run along the Samur–Devechi and Lankaran lowlands.

[[Yanar Dag]], translated as "burning mountain", is a natural gas fire which blazes continuously on a hillside on the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on the [[Caspian Sea]] near [[Baku]], which itself is known as the "land of fire." Flames jet out into the air from a thin, porous sandstone layer. It is a tourist attraction to visitors to the Baku area.

[[File:Stamp of Azerbaijan 750.jpg|thumb|The [[Karabakh horse]] is the national animal of Azerbaijan.]]
The first reports on the richness and diversity of animal life in Azerbaijan can be found in travel notes of Eastern travelers. Animal carvings on architectural monuments, ancient rocks and stones survived up to the present times. The first information on the flora and fauna of Azerbaijan was collected during the visits of naturalists to Azerbaijan in the 17th century.<ref name="GEO"/>

There are 106 species of mammals, 97 species of fish, 363 species of birds, 10 species of amphibians and 52 species of reptiles which have been recorded and classified in Azerbaijan.<ref name="GEO"/> The national animal of Azerbaijan is the [[Karabakh horse]], a mountain-steppe racing and riding horse endemic to Azerbaijan. The Karabakh horse has a reputation for its good temper, speed, elegance and intelligence. It is one of the oldest breeds, with ancestry dating to the ancient world. However, today the horse is an endangered species.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Karabakh Horse| publisher = Karabakh Foundation| url = http://www.karabakhfoundation.org/pages/history-and-culture/karabakh-region/the-karabakh-horse/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101013010330/http://karabakhfoundation.org/pages/history-and-culture/karabakh-region/the-karabakh-horse/| archivedate = 13 October 2010| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Azerbaijan's flora consists of more than 4,500 species of [[higher plants]]. Due to the unique climate in Azerbaijan, the flora is much richer in the number of species than the flora of the other republics of the South Caucasus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_Geography/_Planting/_planting_e.html |title=Azerbaijan – Flora |publisher=Heydar Aliyev Foundation|accessdate=5 March 2010 }}</ref> About 67 percent of the species growing in the whole [[Caucasus]] can be found in Azerbaijan.

[[File:Munich Security Conference 2010 - dett aliyew 0014.jpg|upright|thumb|The son of former President [[Heydar Aliyev]], [[Ilham Aliyev]], succeeded his father and has remained in power since 2003.]]
The structural formation of Azerbaijan's political system was completed by the adoption of the new [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]] on 12 November 1995. According to Article 23 of the Constitution, the [[National symbol|state symbols]] of the Azerbaijan Republic are the [[Flag of Azerbaijan|flag]], the [[Coat of arms of Azerbaijan|coat of arms]], and the [[National Anthem of the Republic of Azerbaijan|national anthem]]. The state power in Azerbaijan is limited only by law for internal issues, but for international affairs is additionally limited by the provisions of international agreements.

The Constitution of Azerbaijan states that it is a presidential republic with three branches of power – Executive, Legislative and Judicial. The legislative power is held by the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Assembly of Azerbaijan|National Assembly]] and the Supreme National Assembly in the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. The Parliament of Azerbaijan, called Milli Majlis, consists of 125 deputies and elected based on majority voting system, with a term of 5 years for each elected member. The elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The Parliament is not responsible for formation of the government, but the Constitution requires approval of the Cabinet of Ministers by Milli Majlis<ref>(Constitution of Azerbaijan Republic, Articles 104-107).</ref> The [[New Azerbaijan Party|Yeni Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat. European observers [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Campaign irregularities|found numerous irregularities]] in the run-up to the election and [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010#Election|on election day]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Monitors criticize Azerbaijani elections |publisher=[[Al Jazeera]] |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html |accessdate=8 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111072636/http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2010/11/2010118152810836488.html |archivedate=11 November 2010 |deadurl=no  }}</ref>

The executive power is held by the [[President of Azerbaijan|President]], who is elected for a seven-year term by direct elections, and the [[Prime Minister of Azerbaijan|Prime Minister]]. The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the President and the National Assembly.<ref name="LaPorte2016" /> The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]], and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The president nominates the judges in these courts. The [[European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice]] (CEPEJ) report refers to the Azerbaijani justice model on the selection of new judges as best practice, reflecting the particular features and the course of development towards ensuring the independence and quality of the judiciary in a new democracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&Ref=CEPEJ-COOP(2011)1&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&BackColorIntranet=FDC864&BackColorLogged=FDC864&direct=true|title=Efficiency of justice – CEPEJ – European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) – Report requested by the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijan – Assessment of policy and procedures for the selection of judges in Azerbaijan – prepared by Mr Audun Hognes BERG, Head of International Secretariat, Norwegian Courts Administration, CEPEJ Bureau member and Ms Ivana GORANIĆ, Director of the Judicial Academy, Republic of Croatia, Representative of the Lisbon Network to the CEPEJ|last=CEPEJ|first=Council of Europe, Human Rights and Rule of Law, Efficiency of justice -|website=wcd.coe.int|access-date=14 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jean|first=Jean – Paul|year=2015|title=High quality justice for all member states of the Council of Europe|url=https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/textes/CEPEJ_Study22_EN.pdf|journal=Council of Europe|volume=|page=119|via=}}</ref>

Azerbaijan's system of governance nominally can be called two-tiered. The top or highest tier of the government is the Executive Power headed by President. The President appoints the Cabinet of Ministers and other high-ranking officials. The Local Executive Authority is merely continuation of Executive Power.The legal status of local state administration in Azerbaijan is determined by the Provision on Local Executive Authority (''Yerli Icra Hakimiyati''), adopted 16 June 1999. In June 2012, the President approved the new Regulation, which granted additional powers to Local Executive Authorities, strengthening their dominant position in Azerbaijan's local affairs<ref>{{cite web |title=Azərbaycan Prezidentinin Rəsmi internet səhifəsi |url=https://president.az/ |website=president.az |language=az}}</ref> Chapter 9 of the Constitution of the Azerbaijan Republic addresses major issues of local self-government, such as the legal status of municipalities, types of local self-government bodies, their basic powers and relationships to other official entities. The other nominal tier of governance is municipalities (''Bələdiyə'') and members of municipalities are elected by general vote in Municipal elections every five years. Currently there are 1,607 municipalities across the country. The Law on Municipal Elections and the Law on the Status of Municipalities were the first to be adopted in the field of local government (2 July 1999). The Law on Municipal Service regulates the activities of municipal employees, their rights, duties, labor conditions and social benefits, and outlines the structure of the executive apparatus and the organization of municipal service. The Law on the Status of Municipalities regulates the role and structure of municipal bodies and outlines state guarantees of legal and financial autonomy. The law pays special attention to the adoption and execution of municipal programs concerning social protection, social and economic development and the local environment.

The Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution. It was established on 10 April 1997. The administrative department is not a part of the president's office but manages the financial, technical and pecuniary activities of both the president and his office.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves "Turcoman" rather than "Oghuz," had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.

His major works include ''The Divan of Ghazals'' and ''The Qasidas''. In the same century, Azerbaijani literature further flourished with the development of [[Ashik]] ({{lang-az|Aşıq}}) poetic genre of bards. During the same period, under the pen-name of Khatāī ({{lang-ar|خطائی}} for ''sinner'') Shah Ismail I wrote about 1400 verses in Azerbaijani,<ref name="minorsky1">{{cite journal |last=Minorsky |first=Vladimir |year=1942 |title=The Poetry of Shah Ismail |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=10 |issue=4 |page=1053 |url= |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00090182 }}</ref> which were later published as his ''Divan''.

Entries submitted on the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] tentative list include the [[Ateshgah of Baku]], [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]], [[Hirkan National Park]], [[Binegadi National Park]], [[Lökbatan Mud Volcano]], [[Baku Stage Mountain]], [[Caspian Shore Defensive Constructions]], [[Shusha National Reserve]], [[Ordubad National Reserve]] and the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan Properties inscribed on the World Heritage List | publisher = [[UNESCO]] | url = http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/az}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title =World Heritage Sites in Azerbaijan | publisher = World Heritage Site | url = http://www.worldheritagesite.org/countries/azerbaijan.html}}</ref>

Among other architectural treasures are [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Quadrangular Castle]] in [[Mardakan]], [[Parigala]] in [[Yuxarı Çardaqlar|Yukhary Chardaglar]], a number of bridges spanning the Aras River, and several mausoleums. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, little monumental architecture was created, but distinctive residences were built in Baku and elsewhere. Among the most recent architectural monuments, the [[Baku Metro|Baku subways]] are noted for their lavish decor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Over 70 underground stations to be built in Baku|url=http://news.az/articles/economy/25958|publisher=News.Az|accessdate=18 February 2011}}</ref>

The task for modern Azerbaijani architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. Major projects such as [[Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]] and [[SOCAR Tower]] have transformed the country's skyline and promotes its contemporary identity.<ref>{{cite web |author=1 February 2012 Jon Walton |url=http://www.constructiondigital.com/under_construction/100-billion-khazar-islands-taking-shape |title=$100 Billion Khazar Islands Taking Shape |publisher=Construction Digital |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713004934/http://www.constructiondigital.com/under_construction/100-billion-khazar-islands-taking-shape |archivedate=13 July 2012  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Glass|first=Nick|title=Flame Towers light up Baku's historic skyline|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/09/26/world/asia/great-buildings-barry-hughes|publisher=CNN |accessdate=14 April 2013|authorlink=Nick Glass}}</ref>

===Visual art===
{{Main|Visual arts of Azerbaijan}}
[[File:Sheki dvoretc rospisi az.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature painting]] of a battle scene on the walls of the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]], 18th century, [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|city of Shaki]]]]
Azerbaijani art includes one of the oldest art objects in the world, which were discovered as [[Gamigaya Petroglyphs]] in the territory of [[Ordubad Rayon]] are dated back to the 1st to 4th centuries BC. About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer, goats, bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings and also people, carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks.<ref>[http://irs-az.com/pdf/090621154956.pdf Наскальные рисунки Гямигая]. irs-az.com.</ref> Norwegian [[ethnographer]] and adventurer [[Thor Heyerdahl]] was convinced that people from the area went to [[Scandinavia]] in about 100 AD, took their boat building skills with them, and transmuted them into the Viking boats in Northern Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ornaments Coming from Gobustan |url=http://divainternational.ch/spip.php?article169|website=Diva International}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gobustan Rock Art|url=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/gobustan.html|website=www.worldheritagesite.org|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

Over the centuries, Azerbaijani art has gone through many stylistic changes. Azerbaijani painting is traditionally characterized by a warmth of colour and light, as exemplified in the works of [[Azim Azimzade]] and [[Bahruz Kangarli]], and a preoccupation with religious figures and cultural motifs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Azerbaijani Artists |url=http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/soviet/Azerbaijani-Artists.html|website=www.arthistoryarchive.com|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> Azerbaijani painting enjoyed preeminence in Caucasus for hundreds of years, from the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] periods, and through the [[Socialist realism|Soviet]] and [[Baroque]] periods, the latter two of which saw fruition in Azerbaijan. Other notable artists who fall within these periods include [[Sattar Bahlulzade]], [[Togrul Narimanbekov]], [[Tahir Salahov]], [[Alakbar Rezaguliyev]], [[Mirza Gadim Iravani]], [[Mikayil Abdullayev]] and [[Boyukagha Mirzazade]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Steps of Time & Art is not only ugly|url=http://universes-in-universe.org/eng/nafas/articles/2008/azerbaijan_art|website=universes-in-universe.org|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>

===Cinema===

{{Main|Cinema of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani animation|Television in Azerbaijan}}
The film industry in Azerbaijan dates back to 1898. In fact, Azerbaijan was among the first countries involved in [[cinematography]].<ref name="mishon">{{cite news |url= http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html|title=Cinema in Azerbaijan: Pre-Soviet Era|date=Autumn 1997|publisher="Azerbaijan International"|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref> Therefore, it's not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in [[Baku]] – at the start of the 20th century, this bay town on the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work.<ref name="cinemainazerbaijan">[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/53_folder/53_articles/53_100years.html Celebrating 100 Years in Film, not 80] by Aydin Kazimzade. Azerbaijan International, Autumn 1997</ref> In 1919, during the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], a documentary ''The Celebration of the Anniversary of Azerbaijani Independence'' was filmed on the first anniversary of Azerbaijan's independence from Russia, 27 May, and premiered in June 1919 at several theatres in Baku.<ref name="ocaz">{{cite web| title =Azerbaijani cinema in 1920–1935: Silent films | publisher = OCAZ.eu| url = http://www.ocaz.eu/cinema-theatre.html}}</ref> After the Soviet power was established in 1920, Nariman Narimanov, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Azerbaijan, signed a decree nationalizing Azerbaijan's cinema. This also influenced the creation of [[Azerbaijani animation]].<ref name="ocaz"/>

In 1991, after Azerbaijan gained its independence from the Soviet Union, the first Baku International Film Festival East-West was held in Baku. In December 2000, the former President of Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev, signed a decree proclaiming 2 August to be the professional holiday of filmmakers of Azerbaijan. Today Azerbaijani filmmakers are again dealing with issues similar to those faced by cinematographers prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union in 1920. Once again, both choice of content and sponsorship of films are largely left up to the initiative of the filmmaker.<ref name="mishon"/>

===Media and media freedom===
{{Main|Media of Azerbaijan|Media freedom in Azerbaijan}}
There are three state-owned television channels: [[AzTV]], [[Idman Azerbaijan TV|Idman TV]] and [[Medeniyyet TV]]. One public channel and 6 private channels: [[İctimai Television]], [[ANS TV]], [[Space TV]], [[Lider TV]], [[Azad Azerbaijan TV]], [[Xazar TV]] and [[Region TV]].

===Human rights in Azerbaijan===

[[File:Rashadat Akhundov.jpg|thumb|[[Rashadat Akhundov]], the co-founder of [[Nida Civic Movement]], was sentenced to 8 years of imprisonment on 6 May 2014.]]
The [[Constitution of Azerbaijan]] claims to guarantee freedom of speech, but this is denied in practice. After several years of decline in press and media freedom, in 2014, the media environment in Azerbaijan deteriorated rapidly under a governmental campaign to silence any opposition and criticism, even while the country led the Committee of Ministers of the [[Council of Europe]] (May–November 2014). Spurious legal charges and impunity in violence against journalists have remained the norm.<ref name=pace>Parliamentary Assembly of the [[Council of Europe]], [http://www.cfom.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PACE-HORSLEY-FINAL-2014-REPORT-AAC-25_14-Flego-protection-of-media-freedom-18-June.pdf The Protection of media freedom in Europe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702011459/http://www.cfom.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PACE-HORSLEY-FINAL-2014-REPORT-AAC-25_14-Flego-protection-of-media-freedom-18-June.pdf |date=2 July 2016 }}.Background report prepared by Mr William Horsley, special representative for media freedom of the [[Association of European Journalists]]</ref> All foreign broadcasts are banned in the country.<ref name=FH>[[Freedom House]], [https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2015/azerbaijan Azerbaijan] 2015 Press Freedom report</ref>

According to the 2013 [[Freedom House]] [[Freedom of the Press (report)|Freedom of the Press report]], Azerbaijan's press freedom status is "not free," and Azerbaijan ranks 177th out of 196 countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freedom of the Press 2013|url=https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/FOTP%202013%20Full%20Report.pdf|publisher=Freedom House}}</ref>

During the last few years,{{when|date=December 2017}} three journalists were killed and several prosecuted in trials described as unfair by international human rights organizations. Azerbaijan had the biggest number of journalists imprisoned in Europe and Central Asia in 2015, according to the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], and is the 5th most censored country in the world, ahead of Iran and China.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ognianova|first1=Nina|title=Baku 2015: Press freedom, Azerbaijan, and the European Games|url=https://cpj.org/blog/2015/06/baku-2015-press-freedom-azerbaijan-and-the-europea.php|publisher=Committee to Protect Journalists}}</ref>

A report by an [[Amnesty International]] researcher in October 2015 points to '...the severe deterioration of human rights in Azerbaijan over the past few years. Sadly Azerbaijan has been allowed to get away with unprecedented levels of repression and in the process almost wipe out its civil society'.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nozadze|first1=Natalia|title=Azerbaijan closes its doors|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2015/10/azerbaijan-closes-its-doors/|website=News|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref> Amnesty's 2015/16 annual report<ref>{{cite web|last1=Amnesty|first1=International|title=Annual report on Azerbaijan|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/europe-and-central-asia/azerbaijan/|website=Amnesty International}}</ref> on the country stated ' ... persecution of political dissent continued. Human rights organizations remained unable to resume their work. At least 18 prisoners of conscience remained in detention at the end of the year. Reprisals against independent journalists and activists persisted both in the country and abroad, while their family members also faced harassment and arrests. International human rights monitors were barred and expelled from the country. Reports of torture and other ill-treatment persisted.'

''[[The Guardian]]'' reported in April 2017 that "Azerbaijan's ruling elite operated a secret $2.9bn (£2.2bn) scheme to pay prominent Europeans, buy luxury goods and launder money through a network of opaque British companies .... Leaked data shows that the Azerbaijani leadership, accused of serial human rights abuses, systemic corruption and rigging elections, made more than 16,000 covert payments from 2012 to 2014. Some of this money went to politicians and journalists, as part of an international lobbying operation to deflect criticism of Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, and to promote a positive image of his oil-rich country." There was no suggestion that all recipients were aware of the source of the money as it arrived via a disguised route.<ref name="Gdn4917">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/04/uk-at-centre-of-secret-3bn-azerbaijani-money-laundering-and-lobbying-scheme|title=UK at centre of secret $3bn Azerbaijani money laundering and lobbying scheme|last1=Harding|first1=Luke|last2=Barr|first2=Caelainn|last3=Nagapetyants|first3=Dina|date=4 September 2017|work=The Guardian|accessdate=26 December 2017}}</ref>

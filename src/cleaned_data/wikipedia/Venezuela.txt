The territory now known as Venezuela was [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonized by Spain]] in 1522 amid resistance from indigenous peoples. In 1811, it became one of the first Spanish-American territories to [[First Republic of Venezuela|declare independence]], which was not securely established until 1821, when Venezuela was a department of the federal republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. It gained full independence as a country in 1830. During the 19th century, Venezuela suffered political turmoil and autocracy, remaining dominated by regional ''[[caudillo]]s'' (military strongmen) until the mid-20th century. Since 1958, the country has had a series of democratic governments. Economic shocks in the 1980s and 1990s led to several political crises, including the deadly [[Caracazo]] riots of 1989, [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts|two attempted coups in 1992]], and the impeachment of President [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] for embezzlement of public funds in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1998|1998 election]] of former coup-involved career officer [[Hugo Chávez]] and the launch of the [[Bolivarian Revolution]].  The revolution began with a [[1999 Constituent Assembly of Venezuela|1999 Constituent Assembly]], where a new Constitution of Venezuela was written. This new constitution officially changed the name of the country to ''Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela'' ({{lang-es|República Bolivariana de Venezuela}}).

The [[sovereign state]] is a [[federation|federal]] [[presidential republic]] consisting of [[States of Venezuela|23 states]], the [[Venezuelan Capital District|Capital District]] (covering [[Caracas]]), and [[Federal Dependencies of Venezuela|federal dependencies]] (covering Venezuela's offshore islands).

==Etymology==
<!--Section is linked to -->
According to the most popular and accepted version, in 1499, an expedition led by [[Alonso de Ojeda]] visited the Venezuelan coast. The [[stilt houses]] in the area of [[Lake Maracaibo]] reminded the Italian navigator, [[Amerigo Vespucci]], of the city of [[Venice]], Italy, so he named the region ''Veneziola'', or "Little Venice".{{sfn|Massabié|2008|p=153}} The Spanish version of ''Veneziola'' is ''Venezuela''.{{sfn|Thomas|2005|p=189}}

[[Martín Fernández de Enciso]], a member of the Vespucci and Ojeda crew, gave a different account. In his work ''Summa de geografía'', he states that the crew found [[indigenous people]] who called themselves the ''Veneciuela.'' Thus, the name "Venezuela" may have evolved from the native word.<ref name="ICH_1958_386">{{cite journal |year=1958 |title=Cuadernos Hispanoamericanos |publisher=Instituto de Cultura Hispánica (Agencia Española de Cooperación Internacional) |page=386 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

Previously, the official name was [[State of Venezuela|''Estado de Venezuela'']] (1830–1856), ''República de Venezuela'' (1856–1864), [[United States of Venezuela|''Estados Unidos de Venezuela'']] (1864–1953), and again [[Republic of Venezuela|''República de Venezuela'']] (1953–1999).

Evidence exists of human habitation in the area now known as Venezuela from about 15,000 years ago. [[leaf|Leaf-shaped]] tools from this period, together with chopping and [[Plane (tool)|planoconvex]] scraping implements, have been found exposed on the high riverine terraces of the Rio Pedregal in western Venezuela.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=91}} [[Late Pleistocene]] hunting artifacts, including spear tips, have been found at a similar series of sites in northwestern Venezuela known as "El Jobo"; according to [[radiocarbon dating]], these date from 13,000 to 7,000 BC.{{sfn|Kipfer|2000|p=172}}

It is not known how many people lived in Venezuela before the Spanish conquest; it has been estimated at around one million.{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} In addition to indigenous peoples known today, the population included historical groups such as the [[Kalina people|Kalina]] (Caribs), [[Auaké]], [[Caquetio]], [[Mariche]], and [[Timoto–Cuica people|Timoto–Cuicas]]. The Timoto–Cuica culture was the most complex society in Pre-Columbian Venezuela, with pre-planned permanent villages, surrounded by irrigated, terraced fields. They also stored water in tanks.<ref name=mahoney>Mahoney 89</ref> Their houses were made primarily of stone and wood with thatched roofs.

Spain's colonization of mainland Venezuela started in 1522, establishing its first permanent South American settlement in the {{As of |2008 |alt=present-day}} city of [[Cumaná]]. In the 16th century, Venezuela was contracted as a concession by the King of Spain to the German [[Welser]] banking family ([[Klein-Venedig]], 1528–1546). Native ''[[cacique]]s'' (leaders) such as [[Guaicaipuro]] ({{circa|1530–1568}}) and [[Tamanaco]] (died 1573) attempted to resist Spanish incursions, but the newcomers ultimately subdued them; Tamanaco was put to death by order of Caracas' founder, [[Diego de Losada]].<ref name="UNE">{{cite web |publisher=Universidad Nueva Esparta |url=http://www.une.edu.ve/hatillo/historia.htm |title=Alcaldía del Hatillo: Historia |accessdate=10 March 2007 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428111205/http://www.une.edu.ve/hatillo/historia.htm |archivedate=28 April 2006 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In the 16th century, during the Spanish colonization, indigenous peoples such as many of the [[Mariches]], themselves descendants of the Kalina, converted to [[Roman Catholicism]]. Some of the resisting tribes or leaders are commemorated in place names, including Caracas, [[Chacao Municipality|Chacao]] and [[Los Teques]]. The early colonial settlements focused on the northern coast,{{sfn|Wunder|2003|p=130}} but in the mid-18th century, the Spanish pushed farther inland along the [[Orinoco River]]. Here, the [[Ye'kuana]] (then known as the Makiritare) organized serious resistance in 1775 and 1776.{{sfn|Gott|2005|p=203}}

Spain's eastern Venezuelan settlements were incorporated into [[New Andalusia Province]]. Administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Santo Domingo]] from the early 16th century, most of Venezuela became part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] in the early 18th century, and was then reorganized as an autonomous [[Captaincy General of Venezuela|Captaincy General]] starting in 1777. The town of Caracas, founded in the central coastal region in 1567, was well-placed to become a key location, being near the coastal port of [[La Guaira]] whilst itself being located in a valley in a mountain range, providing defensive strength against [[pirate]]s and a more fertile and healthy climate.{{sfn|Ewell|1984|p=4}}

Sucre, who won many battles for Bolívar, went on to liberate [[Ecuador]] and later become the second president of [[Bolivia]]. Venezuela remained part of Gran Colombia until 1830, when a rebellion led by Páez allowed the proclamation of a newly independent Venezuela; Páez became the first president of the new republic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?historyid=ab55 |title=History of Venezuela |publisher=''History World'' |accessdate=30 June 2015}}</ref> Between one-quarter and one-third of Venezuela's population was lost during these two decades of warfare (including perhaps one-half of the [[Venezuelans of European descent|white]] population),<ref>{{cite book |last1=McFarlane |first1=Anthony |title=War and Independence In Spanish America |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1136757723 |page=293 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rSNrAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA293}}</ref> which by 1830, was estimated at about 800,000.<ref name="Caudillismo">"[http://countrystudies.us/venezuela/5.htm Venezuela – The Century of Caudillismo]".

[[Slavery]] in Venezuela was abolished in 1854.<ref name="Caudillismo" /> Much of Venezuela's 19th-century history was characterized by political turmoil and [[dictator]]ial rule, including the Independence leader José Antonio Páez, who gained the presidency three times and served a total of 11 years between 1830 and 1863. This culminated in the [[Federal War]] (1859–1863), a civil war in which hundreds of thousands died in a country with a population of not much more than a million people. In the latter half of the century, [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]], another ''caudillo'', served a total of 13 years between 1870 and 1887, with three other presidents interspersed.

In 1895, a longstanding dispute with Great Britain about the territory of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of [[British Guiana]] and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, erupted into the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1895]]. The dispute became a diplomatic crisis when Venezuela's lobbyist, [[William Lindsay Scruggs|William L. Scruggs]], sought to argue that British behavior over the issue violated the United States' [[Monroe Doctrine]] of 1823, and used his influence in Washington, D.C., to pursue the matter. Then, U.S. president [[Grover Cleveland]] adopted a broad interpretation of the doctrine that did not just simply forbid new European colonies, but declared an American interest in any matter within the hemisphere.{{sfn|Zakaria|1999|pages=145–146}} Britain ultimately accepted arbitration, but in negotiations over its terms was able to persuade the U.S. on many of the details.

In 1899, [[Cipriano Castro]], assisted by his friend [[Juan Vicente Gómez]], seized power in Caracas, marching an army from his base in the Andean state of [[Táchira]]. Castro defaulted on Venezuela's considerable foreign debts and declined to pay compensation to foreigners caught up in Venezuela's civil wars. This led to the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903]], in which Britain, Germany and Italy imposed a naval blockade of several months before international arbitration at the new [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] in [[The Hague]] was agreed. In 1908, [[Dutch-Venezuela War|another dispute]] broke out with the Netherlands, which was resolved when Castro left for medical treatment in Germany and was promptly overthrown by Juan Vicente Gómez (1908–1935).

He remained the most powerful man in Venezuela until his death in 1935, although at times he ceded the presidency to others. The ''gomecista'' dictatorship (1935–1945) system largely continued under [[Eleazar López Contreras]], but from 1941, under [[Isaías Medina Angarita]], was relaxed.  Angarita granted a range of reforms, including the legalization of all political parties. After [[World War II]], [[immigration]] from Southern Europe (mainly from Spain, [[Italo-venezuelans|Italy]], Portugal, and France) and poorer Latin American countries markedly diversified Venezuelan society.

[[File:Rómulo Betancourt, 1961.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rómulo Betancourt]] (president 1945–1948 / 1959–1964), one of the major democracy activists of Venezuela.]]

In 1945, a civilian-military coup overthrew Medina Angarita and ushered in [[El Trienio Adeco|a three-year period of democratic rule]] (1945–1948) under the mass membership party [[Democratic Action (Venezuela)|Democratic Action]], initially under [[Rómulo Betancourt]], until [[Rómulo Gallegos]] won the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1947]] (generally believed to be the first free and fair elections in Venezuela). Gallegos governed until overthrown by a military junta led by the triumvirate Luis Felipe Llovera Páez, [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], and Gallegos' Defense Minister, [[Carlos Delgado Chalbaud]], in the [[1948 Venezuelan coup d'état|1948 Venezuelan ''coup d'état'']].

The most powerful man in the military ''junta'' (1948–1958) was Pérez Jiménez (though Chalbaud was its titular president) and was suspected of being behind the death in office of Chalbaud, who died in a bungled kidnapping in 1950. When the junta unexpectedly lost the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1952|election it held in 1952]], it ignored the results and Pérez Jiménez was installed as president, where he remained until 1958. The expansion of the Venezuelan economy in this period was based on the indebtedness of the Venezuelan nation and that was one of the causes of the economic crisis in Venezuela in the 1960s,<ref name=":03">{{cite book|last=Stambouli|first=Andrés|authorlink=|title=La política extraviada: Una historia de Medina a Chávez|url=|accessdate=|year=2009|publisher=Fundación para la Cultura Urbana|isbn=|editor=|location=|page=97|language=|chapter=}}</ref> in which important projects such as the Urban Center El Recreo de Marcel Brauer on Avenida Casanova in [[Sabana Grande, Caracas|Sabana Grande]] district were paralyzed.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://trienal.fau.ucv.ve/2014/cd/PDF/hyp/HP-07.pdf|title=El Centro Urbano El Recreo|last=Mujica|first=Viviana|date=2014|journal=Historia y Patrimonio UCV|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}</ref>

During the years of Pérez Jiménez's administration, the State intervened in areas of the economy that were traditionally carried out by private companies. The Pérez Jiménez government was characterized by its state capitalism and not by liberal capitalism. It was an antecedent of the populist and paternalistic economic regime of the later democratic regimes.<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last=Coronil Ímber|first=Fernando|authorlink=|title=El Estado Mágico|url=https://epulahistoria.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/6-el-estado-mc3a1gico-fernando-coronil.pdf|accessdate=|year=2013|isbn=|editor=Alfadil|location=|page=|language=|chapter=}}</ref> The national private entrepreneurship increasingly had less space to grow and prosper.

In the government of [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez|Pérez Jiménez]], Venezuela's debt grew more than 25 times and went from 175 million to more than 4,500 million bolivares in just 5 years (approximately 15 billion dollars in 2018).

The two first parties would dominate the political landscape for four decades.

During the presidencies of [[Rómulo Betancourt|Rómulo Ernesto Betancourt Bello]] (1959–1964, his second time) and [[Raúl Leoni|Raúl Leoni Otero]] (1964–1969) in the 1960s, substantial guerilla movements occurred, including the [[Armed Forces of National Liberation (Venezuela)|Armed Forces of National Liberation]] and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Venezuela)|Revolutionary Left Movement]], which had split from AD in 1960. Most of these movements laid down their arms under [[Rafael Caldera]]'s first presidency (1969–1974); Caldera had won the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 1968|1968 election]] for COPEI, being the first time a party other than Democratic Action took the presidency through a democratic election. The new democratic order had its antagonists. Betancourt suffered an attack planned by the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1960, and the leftists excluded from the Pact initiated an armed insurgency by organizing themselves in the Armed Forces of National Liberation, sponsored by the Communist Party and Fidel Castro. In 1962 they tried to destabilize the military corps, with failed revolts in Carúpano and Puerto Cabello. At the same time, Betancourt promoted an international doctrine in which he only recognized elected governments by popular vote.{{Request quotation|date=April 2018}}

As a result of the debt that Marcos Pérez Jiménez had left, an economic adjustment program was necessary in Venezuela. The Economic Recovery Plan of 1960 was formulated by Tomás Enrique Carrillo Batalla. The construction industry was revitalized through the "rediscount" of the Central Bank of Venezuela. The Economic Recovery Plan fulfilled its objectives and in 1964, Venezuela was able to return to an anchored exchange rate, with free purchase and sale of foreign currency. This system lasted until the Venezuelan Black Friday of 1983, although the model was already running out at the end of the seventies.<ref name=":132">{{cite journal|url=http://ance.msinfo.info/bases/biblo/texto/NE/NE.18.01.pdf|title=La política cambiaria en Venezuela|last=Palma|first=Pedro|date=2013|journal=Boletín de la Academia Nacional de Ciencias Económicas|accessdate=|doi=|pmid=}}</ref> The consolidation of the democratic system and the dissipation of fears of political radicalization of the country contributed to normalize the demand for foreign currency, stabilizing the parallel exchange rate.

For much of the period between 1950 and 1973, the Venezuelan economy was characterized by its stability and sustained strength, factors that contributed decisively to being able to maintain a fixed exchange rate without major inconveniences. In the period of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] (1974–1979, his first time as president), as a result of the Arab-Israeli war (the Yom Kippur war), the average price of a barrel of oil went from 3.71 to 10.53 dollars and continued to rise to exceed 29 dollars in 1981.<ref name=":132"/> The income of the public sector went from 18,960 million bolivars in 1973 to 45.564 million in 1974.

[[Venezuelan presidential election, 1973|The election in 1973]] of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] coincided with an [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]], in which Venezuela's income exploded as [[oil prices]] soared; oil industries were nationalized in 1976. This led to massive increases in public spending, but also increases in external debts, which continued into the 1980s when the collapse of oil prices during the 1980s crippled the Venezuelan economy. As the government started to devalue the currency in February 1983 to face its financial obligations, Venezuelans' real standards of living fell dramatically. A number of failed economic policies and increasing corruption in government led to rising poverty and crime, worsening social indicators, and increased political instability.<ref name="Schuyler_2001_10">{{cite journal |last=Schuyler |first=George W. |journal=The Policy Studies Organization |title=Health and Neoliberalism: Venezuela and Cuba |year=2001 |page=10}}</ref>

During the presidency of [[Luis Herrera Campins]] (1979–1984), important infrastructure works were completed, such as the Parque Central Complex (which became the largest housing complex and the tallest towers in Latin America), Teresa Carreño Cultural Complex (the largest cultural center in South America at that time), the Brígido Iriarte Stadium and the United Nations Park. Most of these works had been previously planned.<ref name=":152"/> Until the mid-eighties, the Venezuelan economy showed a very positive behavior, characterized by the absence of internal or external imbalances, high economic growth, largely due to the sustained and very high gross fixed investment of those years, 10 under unemployment and great price stability. This translated into sustained increases in the average real wage and an improvement in the condition of life.<ref name=":132"/>

In the 1980s, the Presidential Commission for State Reform (COPRE) emerged as a mechanism of political innovation. Venezuela was preparing for the decentralization of its political system and the diversification of its economy, reducing the large size of the State. The COPRE operated as an innovation mechanism, also by incorporating issues into the political agenda that were generally excluded from public deliberation by the main actors of the Venezuelan democratic system. The most discussed topics were incorporated into the public agenda: decentralization, political participation, municipalization, judicial oder reforms and the role of the State in a new economic strategy.

The Bolivarian Revolution refers to a [[left-wing populism]] [[social movement]] and political process in Venezuela led by the late Venezuelan president, Hugo Chávez, who founded the [[Fifth Republic Movement]] in 1997 and the [[United Socialist Party of Venezuela]] in 2007. The "Bolivarian Revolution" is named after [[Simón Bolívar]], an early 19th-century Venezuelan and [[Latin America]]n revolutionary leader, prominent in the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in achieving the independence of most of northern South America from Spanish rule. According to Chávez and other supporters, the "Bolivarian Revolution" seeks to build a mass movement to implement [[Bolivarianism]]—[[popular democracy]], economic independence, equitable distribution of revenues, and an end to [[political corruption]]—in Venezuela. They interpret Bolívar's ideas from a [[populism|populist]] perspective, using [[Socialism|socialist]] rhetoric.

A collapse in confidence in the existing parties led to Chávez being elected president in 1998, and the subsequent launch of a "Bolivarian Revolution", beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela. Chávez also initiated [[Bolivarian missions]], programs aimed at helping the poor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coha.org/hugo-chavez-and-the-future-of-venezuela/|title=Hugo Chávez and the Future of Venezuela}}</ref>

Chávez survived several further political tests, including an [[Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004|August 2004 recall referendum]]. He was elected for another term [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2006|in December 2006]] and re-elected for a third term in October 2012. However, he was never sworn in for his third period, due to medical complications.

In March 2017, opposition leaders branded President Nicolas Maduro a dictator after the Maduro-aligned Supreme Tribunal, which had been overturning most National Assembly decisions since the opposition took control of the body, took over the functions of the assembly, pushing a lengthy political standoff to new heights.<ref name=reuters-maduro>{{cite news |title=Venezuela's Maduro decried as 'dictator' after Congress annulled |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN17122M |accessdate=26 April 2017 |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=31 March 2017}}</ref> However, the Supreme Court quickly backed down and reversed its decision on 1 April 2017. A month later, President Maduro announced the [[Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election, 2017]] and on 30 August 2017, the [[2017 Constituent National Assembly]] was elected into office and quickly stripped the National Assembly of its powers.

In December 2017, President Maduro declared that leading opposition parties will be barred from taking part in next year's presidential vote after they boycotted mayoral polls.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/12/11/venezuelas-nicolas-maduro-bans-opposition-parties-election/|title=Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro bans opposition parties from election|first=Agence|last=France-Presse|date=11 December 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

Maduro won the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2018|2018 election]] with 67.8% of the vote.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Venezuela}}

[[File:Venezuela Topography.png|290px|thumb|Topographic map of Venezuela]]

Venezuela is located in the north of South America; geologically, its mainland rests on the [[South American Plate]]. It has a total area of {{convert|916445|km2|abbr=on}} and a land area of {{convert|882050|km2|abbr=on}}, making Venezuela the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|33rd largest country in the world]]. The territory it controls lies between latitudes [[equator|0°]] and [[13th parallel north|13°N]] and longitudes [[59th meridian west|59°]] and [[74th meridian west|74°W]].

Shaped roughly like a triangle, the country has a {{convert|2800|km|abbr=on|adj=on}} coastline in the north, which includes numerous islands in the Caribbean and the northeast borders the northern Atlantic Ocean. Most observers describe Venezuela in terms of four fairly well-defined [[topography|topographical]] regions: the [[Maracaibo Basin|Maracaibo lowlands]] in the northwest, the northern mountains extending in a broad east-west arc from the Colombian border along the northern Caribbean coast, the wide plains in central Venezuela, and the [[Guiana Highlands]] in the southeast.

The northern mountains are the extreme northeastern extensions of South America's Andes mountain range. [[Pico Bolívar]], the nation's highest point at {{convert|4979|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, lies in this region. To the south, the dissected [[Guayana Region|Guiana Highlands]] contain the northern fringes of the Amazon Basin and [[Angel Falls]], the world's highest waterfall, as well as ''[[tepui]]s'', large table-like mountains. The country's center is characterized by the ''llanos'', which are extensive plains that stretch from the Colombian border in the far west to the Orinoco River [[river delta|delta]] in the east. The Orinoco, with its rich [[alluvium|alluvial soils]], binds the largest and most important [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|river system]] of the country; it originates in one of the largest [[drainage basin|watersheds]] in Latin America. The [[Caroní River (Venezuela)|Caroní]] and the [[Apure River|Apure]] are other major rivers.

Venezuela borders Colombia to the west, Guyana to the east, and Brazil to the south. Caribbean islands such as Trinidad and Tobago, [[Grenada]], [[Curaçao]], [[Aruba]], and the [[Leeward Antilles]] lie near the Venezuelan coast. Venezuela has territorial disputes with Guyana, formerly United Kingdom, largely concerning the [[Guayana Esequiba|Essequibo area]] and with Colombia concerning the [[Gulf of Venezuela]]. In 1895, after years of diplomatic attempts to solve the border dispute, the dispute over the Essequibo River border flared up. It was submitted to a "neutral" commission (composed of British, American, and Russian representatives and without a direct Venezuelan representative), which in 1899 decided mostly against Venezuela's claim.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/venezuela1895.htm |title=Venezuela Boundary Dispute, 1895–1899}}</ref>

Venezuela's most significant natural resources are [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]], [[iron ore]], [[gold]], and other minerals. It also has large areas of [[arable land]] and water.

[[File:ClimateZones_Venezuela.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Venezuelan climatic types, according to their thermal floors]]

Venezuela is entirely located in the tropics over the Equator to around 12° N. Its climate varies from humid low-elevation plains, where average annual temperatures range as high as {{convert|35|°C|°F|1}}, to glaciers and highlands (the ''[[páramo]]s'') with an average yearly temperature of {{convert|8|°C|°F|1}}. Annual rainfall varies from {{convert|430|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the semiarid portions of the northwest to over {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in the Orinoco Delta of the far east and the Amazonian Jungle in the south. The precipitation level is lower in the period from August through April. These periods are referred to as hot-humid and cold-dry seasons. Another characteristic of the climate is this variation throughout the country by the existence of a mountain range called "Cordillera de la Costa" which crosses the country from east to west. The majority of the population lives in these mountains.<ref name="LOC_2005">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Venezuela.pdf|title=Country Profile: Venezuela|year=2005|publisher=Library of Congress (Federal Research Division)|accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref>

Venezuela is one of the 10 most biodiverse countries on the planet, yet it is one of the leaders of deforestation due to economic and political factors. Each year, roughly 287,600 hectares of forest are permanently destroyed and other areas are degraded by mining, oil extraction, and logging. Between 1990 and 2005, Venezuela officially lost 8.3% of its forest cover, which is about 4.3 million ha. In response, federal protections for critical habitat were implemented; for example, 20% to 33% of forested land is protected.<ref name="Bevilacqua_2002" />  The country's [[biosphere reserve]] is part of the [[World Network of Biosphere Reserves]]; five [[wetlands]] are registered under the [[Ramsar Convention]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Peck |first=D  |year=2000 |title=The Annotated Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance: Venezuela |website=The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands |publisher=Ramsar Convention Secretariat |url=http://www.ramsar.org/profile/profiles_venezuela.htm |accessdate=10 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070211110943/http://ramsar.org/profile/profiles_venezuela.htm |archivedate = 11 February 2007}}</ref> In 2003, 70% of the nation's land was under conservation management in over 200 protected areas, including 43 national parks.<ref name="WRI_2003a">{{cite web |title=Biodiversity and Protected Areas—Venezuela |publisher=World Resources Institute |website=EarthTrends Country Profiles |url=http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/bio_cou_862.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703053321/http://earthtrends.wri.org/pdf_library/country_profiles/bio_cou_862.pdf |archivedate=3 July 2007 |year=2003 |accessdate=10 March 2007}}</ref> [[list of national parks of Venezuela|Venezuela's 43 national parks]] include Canaima National Park, [[Morrocoy National Park]], and [[Mochima National Park]].

{{Main|Government of Venezuela|Politics of Venezuela}}
[[File:PalacioLegislativo2 fixed.jpg|thumb|upright|[[National Assembly of Venezuela]] [[Palacio Federal Legislativo|building]]]]
Following the fall of Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1958, Venezuelan politics were dominated by the [[Third Way]] [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] COPEI and the center-left [[social democracy|social democratic]] Democratic Action (AD) parties; this [[two-party system]] was formalized by the ''[[puntofijismo]]'' arrangement. Economic crises in the 1980s and 1990s led to a political crisis which resulted in hundreds dead in the Caracazo riots of 1989, two attempted coups in 1992, and impeachment of President Carlos Andrés Pérez for corruption in 1993. A collapse in confidence in the existing parties saw the 1998 election of Hugo Chávez, who had led the first of the 1992 coup attempts, and the launch of a "Bolivarian Revolution", beginning with a 1999 Constituent Assembly to write a new Constitution of Venezuela.

The opposition's attempts to unseat Chávez included the 2002 Venezuelan ''coup d'état'' attempt, the Venezuelan general strike of 2002–2003, and the Venezuelan recall referendum, 2004, all of which failed. Chávez was re-elected in December 2006, but suffered a significant defeat in 2007 with the narrow rejection of the [[Venezuelan constitutional referendum, 2007]], which had offered two packages of constitutional reforms aimed at deepening the Bolivarian Revolution.

Two major blocs of [[List of political parties in Venezuela|political parties]] are in Venezuela: the incumbent leftist bloc United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), its major allies [[Fatherland for All]] (PPT) and the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV), and the opposition bloc grouped into the electoral coalition [[Mesa de la Unidad Democrática]]. This includes [[A New Era]] (UNT) together with allied parties [[Project Venezuela]], [[Justice First]], [[Movement for Socialism (Venezuela)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) and others. Hugo Chávez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political landscape since his election to the presidency in 1998 as a political outsider, died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro (initially as interim president, before narrowly winning the [[Venezuelan presidential election, 2013]]).

The Venezuelan president is elected by a vote, with direct and [[universal suffrage]], and is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. The term of office is six years, and (as of 15 February 2009) a president may be re-elected an unlimited number of times. The president appoints the vice president and decides the size and composition of the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and makes appointments to it with the involvement of the legislature. The president can ask the legislature to reconsider portions of laws he finds objectionable, but a simple parliamentary majority can override these objections.

The president may ask the National Assembly to pass an [[Enabling act#In Venezuela|enabling act]] granting the ability to [[rule by decree]] in specified policy areas; this requires a two-thirds majority in the Assembly. Since 1959, six Venezuelan presidents have been granted such powers.

The [[unicameral]] Venezuelan [[parliament]] is the ''Asamblea Nacional'' ("National Assembly"). The number of members is variable – each state and the Capital district elect three representatives plus the result of dividing the state population by 1.1% of the total population of the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ley Orgánica de Procesos Electorales|url=http://www.cne.gov.ve/web/normativa_electoral/ley_organica_procesos_electorales/titulo2.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929053531/http://www.cne.gov.ve/web/normativa_electoral/ley_organica_procesos_electorales/titulo2.php|archivedate=29 September 2010|publisher=Consejo Nacional Electoral|accessdate=4 April 2011|language=es}}</ref> Three seats are reserved for representatives of Venezuela's indigenous peoples.

The [[Law of Venezuela|legal system of Venezuela]] belongs to the [[Civil law (legal system)|Continental Law]] tradition. The highest [[judiciary|judicial]] body is the [[Supreme Tribunal of Justice (Venezuela)|Supreme Tribunal of Justice]] or ''Tribunal Supremo de Justicia'', whose magistrates are elected by parliament for a single two-year term. The [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] (''Consejo Nacional Electoral'', or ''CNE'') is in charge of electoral processes; it is formed by five main directors elected by the National Assembly. Supreme Court president Luisa Estela Morales said in December 2009 that Venezuela had moved away from "a rigid division of powers" toward a system characterized by "intense coordination" between the branches of government. Morales clarified that each power must be independent adding that "one thing is separation of powers and another one is division".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elinformador.com.ve/noticias/venezuela/poder-judicial/luisa-estela-morales-afirma-division-poderes-debilita-estado/8397|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325094828/http://www.elinformador.com.ve/noticias/venezuela/poder-judicial/luisa-estela-morales-afirma-division-poderes-debilita-estado/8397|archivedate=25 March 2010|title=Luisa Estela Morales afirma que la división de poderes debilita al Estado|date=5 December 2009|publisher=El Informador|accessdate=16 January 2010|language=es}}</ref>

[[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2015|Parliamentary Elections]] were held in Venezuela on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 [[deputies]] and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. In 2014, a series of protest and demonstrations began in Venezuela, attributed to inflation, [[violence]] and shortages in Venezuela.

The Bolivarian National Armed Forces of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana, FANB) are the overall unified military forces of Venezuela. It includes over 320,150 men and women, under Article 328 of the Constitution, in 5 components of Ground, Sea and Air. The components of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces are: the [[Venezuelan Army]], the [[Venezuelan Navy]], the [[Venezuelan Air Force]], the [[Venezuelan National Guard]], and the [[Venezuelan National Militia]].

{{As of|2008}}, a further 600,000 soldiers were incorporated into a new branch, known as the Armed Reserve. The president of Venezuela is the [[commander-in-chief]] of the national armed forces. The main roles of the armed forces are to defend the sovereign national territory of Venezuela, airspace, and islands, fight against drug trafficking, to search and rescue and, in the case of a natural disaster, civil protection. All male citizens of Venezuela have a constitutional duty to register for the military service at the age of 18, which is the [[age of majority]] in Venezuela.

==== Corruption ====
{{Main|Corruption in Venezuela}}
[[Corruption in Venezuela]] is high by world standards and was so for much of the 20th century. The discovery of oil had worsened political corruption,<ref>McBeth 2002, p. 17. "From 1917, greater awareness of the country's oil potential had the pernicious effect of increasing the corruption and intrigue amongst Gomez's family and entourage, the consequences of which would be felt up to 1935."</ref> and by the late 1970s, [[Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso]]'s description of oil as "the Devil's excrement" had become a common expression in Venezuela.<ref>Coronil 1988, p. 353. "The perception of petroleum as the cause of Venezuela's corruption had become widespread during this period."</ref> Venezuela has been ranked one of the most corrupt countries on the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] since the survey started in 1995. The 2010 ranking placed Venezuela at number 164, out of 178 ranked countries in government transparency.<ref>[http://english.eluniversal.com/2011/01/21/en_ing_esp_the-truth-of-pdval_21A5015053.shtml The truth of Pdval] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514111928/http://english.eluniversal.com/2011/01/21/en_ing_esp_the-truth-of-pdval_21A5015053.shtml |date=14 May 2013 }}, ''[[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]]'', 21 January 2011.</ref> By 2016, the rank had increased to 166 out of 178.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/country/VEN#|title=Transparency International - Venezuela|first=Transparency International|last=e.V.|website=www.transparency.org}}</ref> Similarly, the [[World Justice Project]] ranked Venezuela 99th out of 99 countries surveyed in its 2014 Rule of Law Index.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.worldjusticeproject.org/#/index/VEN|title=WJP Rule of Law Index™ 2014|accessdate=26 April 2015}}</ref>

This corruption is shown with Venezuela's significant involvement in [[Illegal drug trade in Venezuela|drug trafficking]], with [[Colombian cocaine]] and other drugs transiting Venezuela towards the United States and Europe. Venezuela ranks fourth in the world for cocaine seizures, behind Colombia, the United States, and [[Panama]].<ref>United Nations, [http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/WDR2010/AllSeizures.pdf World Drug Report 2010 Statistical Annex: Drug seizures]</ref> In 2006, the government's agency for combating the Illegal drug trade in Venezuela, ''[[National Anti-Drug Office|ONA]]'', was incorporated into the office of the vice-president of the country. However, many major government and military officials have been known for their involvement with drug trafficking; especially with the October 2013 incident of men from the Venezuelan National Guard placing 1.3 tons of [[cocaine]] on a Paris flight knowing they will not face charges.<ref>{{cite news|title=Venezuela: Where The Mafia And The Military Come Together|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/opinion/2014/02/07/venezuela-where-mafia-and-military-come-together/|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=Fox News|date=7 February 2014}}</ref>

== States and regions of Venezuela ==
{{Political subdivisions of Venezuela}}
{{Main|States of Venezuela|Regions of Venezuela}}
Venezuela is divided into 23 states (''estados''), a capital district (''distrito capital'') corresponding to the city of Caracas, and the Federal Dependencies (''Dependencias Federales'', a special territory). Venezuela is further subdivided into 335 [[municipality|municipalities]] (''municipios''); these are subdivided into over one thousand [[parish]]es (''parroquias''). The states are grouped into nine administrative regions (''regiones administrativas''), which were established in 1969 by presidential decree.

The country can be further divided into ten geographical areas, some corresponding to climatic and biogeographical regions. In the north are the [[Venezuelan Andes]] and the [[Coro region]], a mountainous tract in the northwest, holds several [[Mountain range|sierras]] and valleys. East of it are lowlands abutting Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of Venezuela.

The [[Cordillera de la Costa Central|Central Range]] runs parallel to the coast and includes the hills surrounding Caracas; the Eastern Range, separated from the Central Range by the [[Gulf of Cariaco]], covers all of [[Sucre (state)|Sucre]] and northern [[Monagas]]. The [[Insular Region (Venezuela)|Insular Region]] includes all of Venezuela's island possessions: [[Nueva Esparta]] and the various [[Federal Dependencies]]. The Orinoco Delta, which forms a triangle covering [[Delta Amacuro]], projects northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.

The [[Central Bank of Venezuela]] is responsible for developing [[monetary policy]] for the [[Venezuelan bolívar]] which is used as currency. The president of the Central Bank of Venezuela serves as the country's representative in the [[International Monetary Fund]].  The U.S.-based conservative think tank [[The Heritage Foundation]], cited in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', claims Venezuela has the weakest property rights in the world, scoring only 5.0 on a scale of 100; expropriation without compensation is not uncommon. Venezuela has a [[mixed economy]] dominated by the petroleum sector,<ref>[http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/important-facts-related-to-the-economy-of-venezuela.html The Economy Of Venezuela]. World Atlas.</ref> which accounts for roughly a third of GDP, around 80% of exports, and more than half of government revenues.

As of 2011, more than 60% of Venezuela's international reserves was in gold, eight times more than the average for the region. Most of Venezuela's gold held abroad was located in London. On 25 November 2011, the first of US$11 billion of repatriated gold bullion arrived in Caracas; Chávez called the repatriation of gold a "sovereign" step that will help protect the country's foreign reserves from the turmoil in the U.S. and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/10960388-venezuela-gold-returns-to-the-country-the-euphoria-in-the-streets |title=Venezuela: Gold Returns to the Country, The Euphoria in the Streets |date=26 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021010511/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/10960388-venezuela-gold-returns-to-the-country-the-euphoria-in-the-streets |archivedate=21 October 2013 }}</ref> However government policies quickly spent down this returned gold and in 2013 the government was forced to add the dollar reserves of state owned companies to those of the national bank to reassure the international bond market.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-08-09/venezuela-ogles-chavez-s-hidden-billions-as-reserves-sink.html |title=Venezuela Ogles Chavez's Hidden Billions as Reserves Sink |last1=Pons |first1=Corina |last2=Corina |first2=Nathan |date=9 August 2013 |website=www.bloomberg.com |publisher=BLOOMBERG L.P. |accessdate=19 October 2013}}</ref>

Manufacturing contributed 17% of GDP in 2006. Venezuela manufactures and exports heavy industry products such as [[steel]], [[aluminium]] and [[cement]], with production concentrated around [[Ciudad Guayana]], near the [[Guri Dam]], one of the largest in the world and the provider of about three-quarters of Venezuela's electricity. Other notable manufacturing includes [[electronics]] and [[automobiles]], as well as [[beverage]]s, and [[foodstuff]]s. [[Agriculture in Venezuela]] accounts for approximately 3% of GDP, 10% of the labor force, and at least a quarter of Venezuela's land area. The country is not self-sufficient in most areas of [[agriculture]]. In 2012, total food consumption was over 26 million metric tonnes, a 94.8% increase from 2003.<ref>Pearson, Tamara (9 January 2013).

Since the discovery of oil in the early 20th century, Venezuela has been one of the world's leading exporters of oil, and it is a founding member of [[OPEC]]. Previously an underdeveloped exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and cocoa, oil quickly came to dominate exports and government revenues. The 1980s oil glut led to an external debt crisis and a long-running economic crisis, which saw inflation peak at 100% in 1996 and poverty rates rise to 66% in 1995{{sfn|McCaughan|2005|p=32}} as (by 1998) per capita GDP fell to the same level as 1963, down a third from its 1978 peak.{{sfn|Kelly|Palma|2006|p=207}} The 1990s also saw Venezuela experience a [[Venezuelan banking crisis of 1994|major banking crisis in 1994]].

The recovery of oil prices after 2001 boosted the Venezuelan economy and facilitated social spending. With social programs such as the [[Bolivarian Missions]], Venezuela initially made progress in social development in the 2000s, particularly in areas such as health, education, and poverty. Many of the social policies pursued by Chávez and his administration were jump-started by the [[Millennium Development Goals]], eight goals that Venezuela and 188 other nations agreed to in September 2000.<ref>[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/11_MDG%20Report_EN.pdf "The Millennium Development Goals Report 2011".] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309160853/http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/11_MDG%20Report_EN.pdf |date=9 March 2013 }} United Nations. 2011. Web. 2 April 2012.</ref> The sustainability of the Bolivarian Missions has been questioned due to the Bolivarian state's overspending on public works and because the Chávez government did not save funds for future economic hardships like other OPEC nations; with economic issues and poverty rising as a result of their policies in the 2010s.<ref name="ELPAISfeb2015" /><ref name="CSM25march">{{cite news|last1=Gallagher|first1=J.

===Tourism===

[[File:De la Soledad a la Inmensidad....jpg|thumb|Islands of the Venezuelan [[Caribbean Sea]]]]
Tourism has been developed considerably in recent decades, particularly because of its favorable geographical position, the variety of landscapes, the richness of [[plant]] and [[wildlife]], the artistic expressions and the privileged tropical climate of the country, which affords each region (especially the beaches) throughout the year.

[[Margarita Island]] is one of the top tourist destinations for enjoyment and relaxation. It is an island with a modern infrastructure, bordered by beautiful beaches suitable for extreme sports, and features castles, fortresses and churches of great cultural value.

In the first half of the 20th century, U.S. oil companies were heavily involved in Venezuela, initially interested only in purchasing concessions.{{sfn|Yergin|1991|pages=233–236, 432}} In 1943 a new government introduced a 50/50 split in profits between the government and the oil industry. In 1960, with a newly installed democratic government, Hydrocarbons Minister Juan Pablo Pérez Alfonso led the creation of OPEC, the consortium of oil-producing countries aiming to support the price of oil.{{sfn|Yergin|1991|pages=510–513}}

In 1973, Venezuela voted to nationalize its oil industry outright, effective 1 January 1976, with [[Petróleos de Venezuela]] (PDVSA) taking over and presiding over a number of holding companies; in subsequent years, Venezuela built a vast refining and marketing system in the U.S. and Europe.{{sfn|Yergin|1991|p=767}} In the 1990s PDVSA became more independent from the government and presided over an ''apertura'' (opening) in which it invited in foreign investment. Under Hugo Chávez a 2001 law placed limits on foreign investment.

The state oil company PDVSA played a key role in the December 2002 – February 2003 national strike which sought President Chávez' resignation. Managers and skilled highly paid technicians of PDVSA shut down the plants and left their posts, and by some reports sabotaged equipment, and petroleum production and refining by PDVSA almost ceased. Activities eventually were slowly restarted by returning and substitute oil workers. As a result of the strike, around 40% of the company's workforce (around 18,000 workers) were dismissed for "dereliction of duty" during the strike.{{sfn|McCaughan|2005|p=128}}<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.scielo.org.ve/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1012-25082004000200006&lng=es&nrm=iso |title=Venezuela 2001–2004: actores y estrategias|author= López Maya, Margarita |journal= Cuadernos del Cendes |year=2004|volume=21 |issue=56|pages=109–132|issn=1012-2508}}</ref>

Venezuela is connected to the world primarily via air ([[List of airports in Venezuela|Venezuela's airports]] include the [[Simón Bolívar International Airport (Venezuela)|Simón Bolívar International Airport]] in Maiquetía, near Caracas and [[La Chinita International Airport]] near [[Maracaibo]]) and sea (with major sea ports at La Guaira, Maracaibo and [[Puerto Cabello]]).

The [[Orinoco]] River is navigable by oceangoing vessels up to {{convert|400|km}} inland, and connects the major industrial city of Ciudad Guayana to the Atlantic Ocean.

Venezuela has a limited [[Instituto de Ferrocarriles del Estado|national railway system]], which has no active rail connections to other countries. The government of Hugo Chávez tried to invest in expanding it, but Venezuela's rail project is on hold due to Venezuela not being able to pay the $7.5 billion{{clarify|date=April 2017}} and owing [[China Railway]] nearly $500 million.<ref>{{cite news|last=Han Shih|first=Toh|title=China Railway Group's project in Venezuela hits snag|url=http://www.scmp.com/business/china-business/article/1211846/china-railway-groups-project-venezuela-hits-snag|accessdate=14 December 2013|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=11 April 2013}}</ref>

The people of Venezuela come from a variety of ancestries. It is estimated that the majority of the population is of [[Mestizos in Venezuela|mestizo]], or mixed, ethnic ancestry.
Nevertheless, in the 2011 census, which Venezuelans were asked to identify themselves according to their customs and ancestry, the term ''mestizo'' was excluded from the answers. The majority claimed to be mestizo or [[White Venezuelan|white]]—51.6% and 43.6%, respectively.<ref name="Census-ethnics" /> Practically half of the population claimed to be ''[[:wikt:moreno|moreno]]'', a term used throughout Ibero-America that in this case means "dark-skinned" or "brown-skinned", as opposed to having a [[light skin|lighter skin]] (this term connotes [[Human skin colour|skin color or tone]], rather than [[facial feature]]s or descent).

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Venezuela}}
Although most residents are monolingual Spanish speakers, many languages are spoken in Venezuela. In addition to Spanish, the Constitution recognizes more than thirty indigenous languages, including Wayuu, Warao, Pemón, and many others for the official use of the indigenous peoples, mostly with few speakers – less than 1% of the total population. [[Wayuu language|Wayuu]] is the most spoken indigenous language with 170,000 speakers.<ref name="Ethnologue">{{cite web|title=Venezuela|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/VE|website=Ethnologue|accessdate=23 January 2017}}</ref>

[[File:Joropo foto.jpg|thumb|The ''joropo'', as depicted in a 1912 drawing by [[Eloy Palacios]]]]
The culture of Venezuela is a melting pot, which includes mainly three different families: The indigenous, African, and Spanish. The first two cultures were in turn differentiated according to the tribes. Acculturation and assimilation, typical of a cultural syncretism, caused an arrival at the current Venezuelan culture, similar in many respects to the rest of Latin America, although the natural environment means that there are important differences.

The indigenous influence is limited to a few words of vocabulary and gastronomy and many place names. The African influence in the same way, in addition to musical instruments like the drum. The Spanish influence was predominant (due to the colonization process and the socioeconomic structure it created) and in particular came from the regions of Andalusia and Extremadura, the places of origin of most settlers in the Caribbean during the colonial era. An example of this includes buildings, music, the Catholic religion, and language.

Spanish influences are evident in bullfights and certain features of gastronomy. Venezuela was also enriched by other streams of Indian and European origin in the 19th century, especially from France. In the latest stage in the major cities and regions oil of U.S. origin and manifestations of the new immigration of Spanish, Italian and Portuguese, increasing the already complex cultural mosaic. For example, from United States comes the influence of taste for baseball, U.S.-style fast food, and current architectural constructions.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Venezuelan literature}}
[[Venezuelan literature]] originated soon after the Spanish conquest of the mostly pre-literate indigenous societies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latintrails.com/venezuela-info|title=Information|publisher=''Latin Trails''|accessdate=1 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702042820/http://www.latintrails.com/venezuela-info|archivedate=2 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It was originally dominated by [[Spanish culture|Spanish influences]].  Following the rise of political literature during the Venezuelan War of Independence, Venezuelan [[Romanticism]], notably expounded by [[Juan Vicente González]], emerged as the first important genre in the region. Although mainly focused on [[narrative]] writing, Venezuelan literature was advanced by poets such as [[Andrés Eloy Blanco]] and [[Fermín Toro]].

Major writers and novelists include [[Rómulo Gallegos]], [[Teresa de la Parra]], [[Arturo Uslar Pietri]], [[Adriano González León]], [[Miguel Otero Silva]], and [[Mariano Picón Salas]]. The great poet and humanist [[Andrés Bello]] was also an educator and intellectual (He was also a childhood tutor and mentor of Simón Bolívar). Others, such as [[Laureano Vallenilla Lanz]] and [[José Gil Fortoul]], contributed to Venezuelan [[Positivism]].

Indigenous [[Music of Venezuela|musical styles of Venezuela]] are exemplified by the groups ''[[Un Sólo Pueblo]]'' and ''[[Serenata Guayanesa]]''. The national musical instrument is the [[cuatro (instrument)|cuatro]]. Typical musical styles and pieces mainly emerged in and around the ''llanos'' region, including ''Alma Llanera'' (by [[Pedro Elías Gutiérrez]] and [[Rafael Bolívar Coronado]]), ''Florentino y el diablo'' (by [[Alberto Arvelo Torrealba]]), ''Concierto en la llanura'' by [[Juan Vicente Torrealba]], and ''[[Caballo Viejo]]'' (by [[Simón Díaz]]).

The Zulian ''[[Gaita Zuliana|gaita]]'' is also a very popular style, generally performed during Christmas. The national dance is the ''[[joropo]]''.{{sfn|Cortés|2013|p=2134}} Venezuela has always been a melting pot of cultures and this can be seen in the richness and variety of its musical styles and dances: [[Calypso music|calipso]], [[bambuco]], [[fulía]], cantos de pilado de maíz, cantos de lavanderas, [[sebucán]], and [[maremare]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turpialtravel.com/countries/key-facts-venezuela.html|title=Key Facts Venezuela|publisher=''Turpial Travel & Adventure''|accessdate=13 July 2015}}</ref> [[Teresa Carreño]] was a world-famous 19th century piano virtuoso.

The origins of baseball in Venezuela is unclear, although it is known that the sport was being played in the nation by the late 19th century.{{sfn|Nichols|Morse|2010|p=306}} In the early 20th century, North American immigrants who came to Venezuela to work in the nation's oil industry helped to popularize the sport in Venezuela.{{sfn|Wardrope|2003|p=37}} During the 1930s, baseball's popularity continued to rise in the country, leading to the foundation of the [[Venezuelan Professional Baseball League]] (LVBP) in 1945, and the sport would soon become the nation's most popular.{{sfn|Jozsa Jr.|2013|p=12}}{{sfn|Gibson|2006|p=18}}

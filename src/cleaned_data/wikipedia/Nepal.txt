== Etymology ==
Local legends have it that a [[Hindu]] sage named "Ne" established himself in the valley of [[Kathmandu]] in prehistoric times, and that the word "Nepal" came into existence as the place was protected ("pala" in [[Pali]]) by the sage "Nemi". It is mentioned in [[Vedic]] texts that this region was called Nepal centuries ago. According to the ''[[Skanda Purana]]'', a [[rishi]] called "Nemi" used to live in the [[Himalayas]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Dangol |first=Amrit |url=http://www.aloneinkathmandu.com/2007/05/something-about-nepal.html |title=Alone in Kathmandu |publisher=Alone in Kathmandu |date=6 May 2007 |accessdate=29 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822161349/http://www.aloneinkathmandu.com/2007/05/something-about-nepal.html |archive-date=22 August 2009 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> In the ''Pashupati Purana'', he is mentioned as a saint and a protector.<ref>Prasad, P. 4 ''The life and times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana of Nepal''</ref> He is said to have practiced [[tapasya|meditation]] at the [[Bagmati River|Bagmati]] and Kesavati rivers<ref>Khatri, P. 16 ''The Postage Stamps of Nepal''</ref> and to have taught there.<ref name="autogenerated2">W.B., P. 34 ''Land of the Gurkhas''</ref>

The name of the country is also identical in origin to the name of the [[Newar people]]. The terms "Nepāl", "Newār", "Newāl" and "Nepār" are phonetically different forms of the same word, and instances of the various forms appear in texts in different times in history. Nepal is the learned [[Sanskrit]] form and Newar is the colloquial [[Prakrit]] form.<ref>{{cite web |last=Malla |first=Kamal P |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/?attachment_id=285 |title=Nepala: Archaeology of the Word |publisher= |accessdate=5 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322214352/http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Nepala.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2012}} Page 7.</ref> A Sanskrit inscription dated 512 CE found in Tistung, a valley to the west of Kathmandu, contains the phrase "greetings to the Nepals" indicating that the term "Nepal" was used to refer to both the country and the people.<ref>{{cite web |last=Malla |first=Kamal P |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/?attachment_id=285 |title=Nepala: Archaeology of the Word |publisher= |accessdate=5 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322214352/http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Nepala.pdf |archivedate=22 March 2012}} Page 1.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Majupuria |first1=Trilok Chandra |last2=Majupuria |first2=Indra |year=1979 |title=Glimpses of Nepal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jDNuAAAAMAAJ&q=nepal+nepar&dq=nepal+nepar |publisher=Maha Devi |page=8 |accessdate=2 December 2013}}</ref>

It has been suggested that "Nepal" may be a [[Sanskritization]] of "Newar", or "Newar" may be a later form of "Nepal".<ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Ralph L. |url=http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.1.turner.1333792 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714053644/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.1.turner.1333792 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=14 July 2012 |title=A Comparative and Etymological Dictionary of the Nepali Language |publisher=London: Routledge and Kegan Paul |year=1931 |accessdate=8 May 2011}} Page 353.</ref> According to another explanation, the words "Newar" and "Newari" are [[vulgarism]]s arising from the mutation of P to V, and L to R.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hodgson |first=Brian H. |url=https://archive.org/details/essaysonlanguage00hodg |title=Essays on the Languages, Literature and Religion of Nepal and Tibet |publisher=London: Trübner & Co |year=1874 |accessdate=8 May 2011}} Page 51.</ref>

Legends and ancient texts that mention the region now known as Nepal reach back to the 30th century BC.<ref name="Singh">{{cite book |publisher=Gian Pub.

Around 500 BCE, small kingdoms and confederations of clans arose in the southern regions of Nepal. From one of these, the [[Shakya]] polity, arose a prince who later renounced his status to lead an ascetic life, founded [[Buddhism]], and came to be known as [[Gautama Buddha]] (traditionally dated 563–483 BCE).{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

By 250 BCE, the southern regions had come under the influence of the [[Maurya Empire]] of [[North India]] and later became a vassal state under the [[Gupta Empire]] in the 4th century CE.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

There is a quite detailed description of the kingdom of Nepal in the account of the renowned Chinese Buddhist pilgrim monk [[Xuanzang]], dating from about 645 CE.<ref>Li, Rongxi (translator). 1995.

The kings of the Lichhavi dynasty have been found to have ruled Nepal after the Kirat monarchical dynasty. The context that "Suryavansi Kshetriyas had established a new regime by defeating the Kirats" can be found in some genealogies and [[Purana]]s.<ref name="telegraphnepal.com" /> It is not clear yet when the Lichhavi dynasty was established in Nepal. According to the opinion of Baburam Acharya, the prominent historian of Nepal, Lichhavies established their independent rule by abolishing the Kirati state that prevailed in Nepal around 250 CE.<ref name="telegraphnepal.com" />

The Licchavi dynasty went into decline in the late 8th century, and was followed by a [[Newar people|Newar]] or [[Thakuri]] era. Thakuri kings ruled over the country up to the middle of the 12th century CE; King Raghav Dev is said to have founded the ruling dynasty in October 869 CE.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://royalnepal.synthasite.com/the-thakuri-dynasty.php |title=Nepal Monarchy: Thakuri Dynasty |publisher=}}</ref> King Raghav Dev also started the [[Nepal Sambat]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://royalnepal.synthasite.com/the-thakuri-dynasty.php |title=Nepal Monarchy: Thakuri Dynasty |website=royalnepal.synthasite.com}}</ref>

In the early 12th century, leaders emerged in far western Nepal whose names ended with the Sanskrit suffix ''malla'' ("wrestler"). These kings consolidated their power and ruled over the next 200 years, until the kingdom splintered into two dozen petty states. Another Malla dynasty beginning with [[Jayasthitimalla|Jayasthiti]] emerged in the Kathmandu valley in the late 14th century, and much of central Nepal again came under a unified rule. In 1482, the realm was divided into three kingdoms: [[Kathmandu]], [[Patan, Nepal|Patan]], and [[Bhaktapur]].

In the mid-18th century, [[Prithvi Narayan Shah]], a [[Gurkha|Gorkha]] king, set out to put together what would become present-day Nepal. He embarked on his mission by securing the neutrality of the bordering mountain kingdoms. After several bloody battles and sieges, notably the [[Battle of Kirtipur]], he managed to conquer the Kathmandu Valley in 1769. A detailed account of Prithvi Narayan Shah's victory was written by Father Giuseppe, an eyewitness to the war.<ref>{{cite web |last=Giuseppe |first=Father |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vSsoAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA307 |title=Account of the Kingdom of Nepal |work=Asiatick Researches |publisher=London: Vernor and Hood |year=1799 |accessdate=2 June 2012}} p. 308.</ref>

The Gorkha control reached its height when the North Indian territories of the [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] and [[Garhwal Kingdom]]s in the west to [[Sikkim]] in the east came under Nepalese control. A dispute with [[Tibet]] over the control of mountain passes and inner Tingri valleys of Tibet forced the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Emperor]] of China to start the [[Sino-Nepalese War|Sino-Nepali War]] compelling the Nepali to retreat and pay heavy reparations to Peking.

Rivalry between the Kingdom of Nepal and the [[East India Company]] over the control of states bordering Nepal eventually led to the [[Anglo-Nepalese War|Anglo-Nepali War]] (1815–16). At first, the British underestimated the Nepali and were soundly defeated until committing more military resources than they had anticipated needing. Thus began the reputation of [[Gurkha]]s as fierce and ruthless soldiers. The war ended in the [[Sugauli Treaty]], under which Nepal ceded recently captured lands as well as the right to recruit soldiers. [[Madhesi people|Madhesis]], having supported the East India Company during the war, had their lands gifted to Nepal.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/93012226/ |title=Nepal and Bhutan : country studies |first1=harris, george |last1=lawrence |first2=library of congress. federal research |last2=division |first3=savada, andrea |last3=matles |publisher=}}</ref>

Factionalism inside the royal family led to a period of instability. In 1846, a plot was discovered revealing that the reigning queen had planned to overthrow Jung Bahadur Kunwar, a fast-rising military leader. This led to the [[Kot massacre]]; armed clashes between military personnel and administrators loyal to the queen led to the execution of several hundred princes and chieftains around the country. Jung Bahadur Kunwar emerged victorious and founded the [[Rana dynasty]], later known as [[Jung Bahadur Rana]]. The king was made a titular figure, and the post of Prime Minister was made powerful and hereditary. The Ranas were staunchly pro-British and assisted them during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] (and later in both World Wars). Some parts of the Terai region populated with non-Nepali peoples were gifted to Nepal by the British as a friendly gesture because of her military help to sustain British control in India during the rebellion. In 1923, the [[United Kingdom]] and Nepal formally signed [[Nepal–Britain_Treaty_of_1923|an agreement of friendship]] that superseded the Sugauli Treaty of 1816.<ref name="auto" />

In the late 1940s, newly emerging pro-democracy movements and political parties in Nepal were critical of the Rana autocracy. Meanwhile, with the invasion of [[Tibet]] by [[China]] in the 1950s, [[India]] sought to counterbalance the perceived military threat from its northern neighbour by taking pre-emptive steps to assert more influence in Nepal. India sponsored both [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] (ruled 1911–55) as Nepal's new ruler in 1951 and a new government, mostly comprising the [[Nepali Congress]], thus terminating Rana hegemony in the kingdom.<ref name="auto" />

After years of power wrangling between the king and the government, [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra]] (ruled 1955–72) scrapped the democratic experiment in 1959, and a "partyless" [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system was made to govern Nepal until 1989, when the [[People's Movement I (1990)|"Jan Andolan" (People's Movement)]] forced [[Birendra of Nepal|King Birendra]] (ruled 1972–2001) to accept constitutional reforms and to establish a multiparty parliament that took seat in May 1991.<ref name="Nepal_Timeline">{{cite news |title=Timeline: Nepal |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/country_profiles/1166516.stm |accessdate=29 September 2005}}</ref> In 1991–92, Bhutan expelled roughly 100,000 Bhutanese citizens of Nepali descent, most of whom have been living in seven refugee camps in eastern Nepal ever since.<ref name="Bhutan" />

In 1996, the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Communist Party of Nepal]] started a violent bid to replace the royal parliamentary system with a people's republic. This led to the long [[Nepali Civil War]] and more than 12,000 deaths.

On 1 June 2001, there was a [[Nepalese royal massacre|massacre in the royal palace]]. [[Birendra of Nepal|King Birendra]], [[Aishwarya of Nepal|Queen Aishwarya]] and seven other members of the royal family were killed. The alleged perpetrator was [[Dipendra of Nepal|Crown Prince Dipendra]], who allegedly committed suicide (he died three days later) shortly thereafter. This outburst was alleged to have been Dipendra's response to his parents' refusal to accept his choice of wife. Nevertheless, there is speculation and doubts among Nepali citizens about who was responsible.

Following the carnage, King Birendra's brother [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] inherited the throne. On 1 February 2005, King Gyanendra dismissed the entire government and assumed full executive powers to quash the violent Maoist movement,<ref name="Nepal_Timeline" /> but this initiative was unsuccessful because a stalemate had developed in which the Maoists were firmly entrenched in large expanses of countryside but could not yet dislodge the military from numerous towns and the largest cities. In September 2005, the Maoists declared a three-month unilateral ceasefire to negotiate.

In response to the [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|2006 democracy movement]], King Gyanendra agreed to relinquish sovereign power to the people. On 24 April 2006 the dissolved House of Representatives was reinstated. Using its newly acquired sovereign authority, on 18 May 2006 the House of Representatives unanimously voted to curtail the power of the king and declared Nepal a [[secular state]], ending its time-honoured official status as a Hindu Kingdom. On 28 December 2007, a bill was passed in parliament to amend Article 159 of the constitution&nbsp;– replacing "Provisions regarding the King" by "Provisions of the Head of the State"&nbsp;– declaring Nepal a [[federal republic]], and thereby abolishing the monarchy.<ref name=CNN>{{cite news |title=Nepal votes to end monarchy |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/asiapcf/12/28/nepal.monarchy/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |newspaper=CNN Asia report}}</ref> The bill came into force on 28 May 2008.<ref name="Abolish">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7424302.stm |title=Nepal votes to abolish monarchy |publisher=BBC News |date=28 May 2008 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}</ref>

=== Republic of Nepal (2008–present) ===
The [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] won the largest number of seats in the Constituent Assembly election held on 10 April 2008, and formed a coalition government, which included most of the parties in the CA. Although acts of violence occurred during the pre-electoral period, election observers noted that the elections themselves were markedly peaceful and "well-carried out".<ref name="TCC">{{cite web |author=The Carter Center |title=Activities by Country: Nepal |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/countries/nepal.html |accessdate=17 July 2008}}</ref>

[[File:K%C3%B6ppen_climate_types_of_Nepal.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Köppen climate classification map of Nepal]]
Nepal is of roughly trapezoidal shape, {{convert|800|km|mi|-1}} long and {{convert|200|km|mi|-1}} wide, with an area of {{convert|147181|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}. See [[List of political and geographic subdivisions by total area from 100,000 to 1,000,000 square kilometers|List of territories by size]] for the comparative size of Nepal. It lies between latitudes [[26th parallel north|26°]] and [[31st parallel north|31°N]], and longitudes [[80th meridian east|80°]] and [[89th meridian east|89°E]].

Nepal is commonly divided into three physiographic areas: Himal, Pahad and [[Terai]]. These ecological belts run east–west and are vertically{{clarify|date=July 2018}} intersected by Nepal's major, north to south flowing river systems.

The southern lowland plains or ''Terai'' bordering India are part of the northern rim of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]. Terai is a lowland region containing some hill ranges. The plains were formed and are fed by three major Himalayan rivers: the [[Koshi river|Kosi]], the [[Gandaki River|Narayani]], and the [[Ghaghara|Karnali]] as well as smaller rivers rising below the permanent snowline. This region has a subtropical to tropical climate. The outermost range of foothills called [[Sivalik Hills]] or Churia Range, cresting at {{convert|700|to|1000|m|ft|-1}}, marks the limit of the Gangetic Plain; however broad, low valleys called [[Inner Terai Valleys of Nepal|Inner Tarai Valleys]] (Bhitri Tarai Uptyaka) lie north of these foothills in several places.

Pahad is a mountain region that does not generally contain snow. The mountains vary from {{convert|800|to|4000|m|ft|-2}} in altitude with progression from subtropical climates below {{convert|1200|m|ft|-2}} to alpine climates above {{convert|3600|m|ft|-2}}. The [[Lower Himalayan Range]], reaching {{convert|1500|to|3000|m|ft|-2}}, is the southern limit of this region, with subtropical river valleys and "hills" alternating to the north of this range. Population density is high in valleys but notably less above {{convert|2000|m|ft|-2}} and very low above {{convert|2500|m|ft|-2}}, where snow occasionally falls in winter.

Himal is the mountain region containing snow and situated in the Great Himalayan Range; it makes up the northern part of Nepal. It contains the highest elevations in the world including {{convert|8848|m|ft|0}} height [[Mount Everest]] (''Sagarmāthā'' in Nepali) on the border with China. Seven other of the world's "[[eight-thousander]]s" are in Nepal or on its border with China: [[Lhotse]], [[Makalu]], [[Cho Oyu]], [[Kangchenjunga]], [[Dhaulagiri]], [[Annapurna]] and [[Manaslu]].

=== Climate ===
Nepal has five climatic zones, broadly corresponding to the altitudes. The tropical and subtropical zones lie below {{convert|1200|m|ft|-2}}, the [[temperate]] zone {{convert|1200|to|2400|m|ft|-2}}, the cold zone {{convert|2400|to|3600|m|ft|-2}}, the subarctic zone {{convert|3600|to|4400|m|ft|-2}}, and the Arctic zone above {{convert|4400|m|ft|-2}}.

Nepal experiences five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]], autumn, winter and spring. The Himalaya blocks cold winds from Central Asia in the winter and forms the northern limit of the monsoon wind patterns. In a land once thickly forested, [[Deforestation in Nepal|deforestation]] is a major problem in all regions, with resulting erosion and degradation of ecosystems.

Nepal is popular for mountaineering, having some of the highest and most challenging mountains in the world, including [[Mount Everest]]. Technically, the southeast ridge on the Nepali side of the mountain is easier to climb, so most climbers prefer to trek to Everest through Nepal.

=== Environment ===
The dramatic differences in elevation found in Nepal result in a variety of [[biome]]s, from [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savannas]] along the Indian border, to [[subtropical]] [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|broadleaf]] and [[Tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|coniferous forests]] in the Hill Region, to [[temperate]] [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|broadleaf]] and [[Temperate coniferous forest|coniferous]] forests on the slopes of the Himalaya, to [[montane grasslands and shrublands]] and rock and ice at the highest elevations.

At the lowest elevations is the [[Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands]] ecoregion. These form a mosaic with the [[Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests]], which occur from {{convert|500|to|1000|m|ft}} and include the Inner Terai Valleys. [[Himalayan subtropical pine forests]] occur between {{convert|1000|and|2000|m|ft}}.

Above these elevations, the [[biogeography]] of Nepal is generally divided from east to west by the Gandaki River. Ecoregions to the east tend to receive more precipitation and to be more species-rich. Those to the west are drier with fewer species.

From {{convert|1500|to|3000|m|ft}}, are temperate broadleaf forests: the [[eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests|eastern]] and [[western Himalayan broadleaf forests]]. From {{convert|3000|to|4000|m|ft}} are the [[eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests|eastern]] and [[western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]].

Nepal has seen rapid political changes during the last three decades. Up until 1990, Nepal was a monarchy under executive control of the King. Faced with a communist movement against absolute monarchy, [[King Birendra]], in 1990, agreed to a large-scale political reform by creating a [[parliamentary monarchy]] with the king as the [[head of state]] and a prime minister as the head of the government.

Nepal's legislature is [[bicameral]], consisting of a [[Nepal House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] called the Pratinidhi Sabha and a [[National Council of Nepal|National Council]] called the Rastriya Sabha. The House of Representatives consisted of 205 members directly elected by the people. The National Council had 60 members: ten nominated by the king, 35 elected by the House of Representatives, and the remaining 15 elected by an electoral college made up of chairs of villages and towns. The legislature had a five-year term but was dissolvable by the king before its term could end. All Nepali citizens 18 years and older became eligible to vote.

The executive comprised the King and the Council of Ministers (the cabinet). The leader of the coalition or party securing the maximum seats in an election was appointed as the Prime Minister. The Cabinet was appointed by the king on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Governments in Nepal tended to be highly unstable, falling either through internal collapse or parliamentary dissolution by the monarch, on the recommendation of the prime minister, according to the constitution; no government has survived for more than two years since 1991.

[[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|A popular democratic movement in April 2006]] brought about a change in the nation's governance: an interim constitution was promulgated, with the King giving up power, and an interim House of Representatives was formed with Maoist members after the new government held peace talks with the Maoist rebels. The number of parliamentary seats was also increased to 330. In April 2007, the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] joined the interim government of Nepal.

In December 2007, the interim parliament passed a bill making Nepal a federal republic, with a president as head of state. Elections for the constitutional assembly were held on 10 April 2008; the Maoist party led the results but did not achieve a simple majority of seats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11057207&amp;fsrc=nwl |title=Nepal's election The Maoists triumph |work=The Economist |date=17 April 2008 |accessdate=29 July 2009}}</ref> The new parliament adopted the 2007 bill at its first meeting by an overwhelming majority, and King [[Gyanendra]] was given 15 days to leave the Royal Palace in central Kathmandu.

On 26 June 2008, the prime minister [[Girija Prasad Koirala]], who had served as Acting Head of State since January 2007, announced that he would resign on the election of the country's first president by the Constituent Assembly. The first round of voting, on 19 July 2008, saw [[Parmanand Jha]] win election as Nepali vice-president, but neither of the contenders for president received the required 298 votes and a second round was held two days later. [[Ram Baran Yadav]] of the [[Nepali Congress]] party defeated Maoist-backed [[Ram Raja Prasad Singh]] with 308 of the 590 votes cast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.presidentofnepal.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804060839/http://presidentofnepal.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 August 2008 |title=Presidentofnepal.com |publisher=Presidentofnepal.com |accessdate=5 December 2012}}</ref> Koirala submitted his resignation to the new president after Yadav's swearing-in ceremony on 23 July 2008.

[[File:Prachanda.jpg|thumb|Prachanda speaking at a rally in Pokhara.]]
On 15 August 2008, Maoist leader [[Prachanda]] ([[Pushpa Kamal Dahal]]) was elected Prime Minister of Nepal, the first since the country's transition from a monarchy to a republic. On 4 May 2009, Dahal resigned over on-going conflicts with regard to the sacking of the Army chief. Since Dahal's resignation, the country has been in a serious political deadlock with one of the big issues being the proposed integration of the former Maoist combatants, also known as the People's Liberation Army, into the national security forces.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/06/AR2010070605214.html |work=The Washington Post |title=Long stalemate after Maoist victory disrupts life in Nepal |first=Anup |last=Kaphle |date=7 July 2010}}</ref> After Dahal, Jhala Nath Khanal of CPN (UML) was elected the Prime Minister.

On 27 May 2012, the country's Constituent Assembly failed to meet the deadline for writing a new constitution for the country. Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai announced that new elections would be held thar later year. "We have no other option but to go back to the people and elect a new assembly to write the constitution," he said in a nationally televised speech. One of the main obstacles has been disagreement over whether the provinces that will be created will be based on ethnicity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2012/05/27/nepal-elections.html |title=Nepal PM calls new elections after constitution failure |publisher=CBC News |date=28 May 2012}}</ref> This election was delayed by the [[Election Commission, Nepal|Election Commission]] for a year, eventually [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2013|occurring in late 2013]] and electing the country's Second Constituent Assembly.

=== Government ===
{{Main|Government of Nepal|Constitution of Nepal}}
Nepal is governed according to the [[Constitution of Nepal]], which came into effect on 20 September 2015, replacing the Interim Constitution of 2007. The Constitution was drafted by the Second Constituent Assembly following the failure of the First Constituent Assembly to produce a constitution in its mandated period. The constitution is the fundamental law of Nepal. It defines Nepal as having multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious, multi-cultural characteristics with common aspirations of people living in diverse geographical regions, and being committed to and united by a bond of allegiance to the national independence, territorial integrity, national interest, and prosperity of Nepal. All Nepali people collectively constitute the nation.

The executive power of the provinces, pursuant to the Constitution and laws, is vested in the Council of Ministers of the province. The executive power of the province shall be exercised by the province Head in case of absence of the province Executive in a State of Emergency or enforcement of Federal rule. Every province has a ceremonial Head as the representative of the Federal government. The President appoints a Governor for every province. The Governor exercises the rights and duties as specified in the constitution or laws. The Governor appoints the leader of the parliamentary party with the majority in the Provincial Assembly as the Chief Minister and the Council of Ministers are formed under the chairpersonship of the Chief Minister.
* [[Legislature|Legislative]]: The Legislature of Nepal, called Federal Parliament, consisting of two Houses, namely the House of Representatives and the National Assembly. Except when dissolved earlier, the term of House of Representatives is five years. The House of Representatives consist of 275 members: 165 members elected through the first-past-the-post electoral system consisting of one member from each of the one hundred and sixty five electoral constituencies formed by dividing Nepal into 165 constituencies based on geography and population; 110 elected from proportional representation electoral system where voters vote for parties, while treating the whole country as a single electoral constituency. The National Assembly is a permanent house. The tenure of members of National Assembly is six years. The National Assembly consists of 59 members: 56 members elected from an Electoral College, comprising members of provincial Assembly and chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of Village councils and Mayors and Deputy Mayors of Municipal councils, with different weights of votes for each, with eight members from each province, including at least three women, one [[Dalit]], and one person with a disability or a member of a minority. 3 members, including at least one woman, are to be nominated by the President on the recommendation of the Government of Nepal. A Pradesh Sabha or Provincial Assembly is the [[unicameral]] [[legislative assembly]] for a federated province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-09-16/ca-approves-ceremonial-prez-bicameral-legislature.html |title=CA approves ceremonial prez, bicameral legislature |date=16 September 2015 |website= |publisher=Kanptipur Media Group |access-date=8 December 2017 |quote=Provincial parliaments will be unicameral. "The CA also approved a mixed electoral system for parliamentary election with 60 percent directly elected and 40 percent proportionally elected."}}</ref> The term for the Provincial Assembly is five years, except when dissolved earlier.
* [[Judiciary|Judicial]]: Powers relating to justice in Nepal are exercised by courts and other judicial institutions in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, other laws, and recognised principles of justice.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Nepal}}
As of 3 April 2018, Nepal is divided into [[List of provinces of Nepal|7 provinces]] and [[List of districts of Nepal|77 districts]]. It has 753 local units.
There are 6 metropolizes, 11 sub-metropolises, 276 municipal councils, and 460 village councils for official works. The constitution grants 22 absolute powers to the local units while they share 15 more powers with the central and provincial governments.<ref name="kathmandupost.ekantipur.com">{{cite web |author=Post Report |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-03-15/744-new-local-units-come-into-effect.html |title=744 new local units come into effect – General – The Kathmandu Post |publisher=Kathmandupost.ekantipur.com |date= |accessdate=23 April 2017}}</ref>

Nepal has close ties with both of its neighbours, India and China. In accordance with a long-standing treaty, Indian and Nepali citizens may travel to each other's countries without a passport or visa. Nepali citizens may work in India without legal restriction. The [[Indian Army]] [[Britain–India–Nepal Tripartite Agreement|maintains]] seven [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]] consisting of [[Gorkha]] troops recruited mostly from Nepal.

However, in the years since the [[Government of Nepal]] has been [[Communization|communized]] and dominated by socialists, and [[Government of India|India's government]] has been controlled by more right-wing parties, India has been remilitarizing the "porous" Indo-Nepali border to stifle the flow of [[Islamist]] groups.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1967859,00.html |title=Nepal: Caught Between China and India |first=Jyoti |last=Thottam |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2 March 2010 |accessdate=26 December 2010}}</ref>

Nepal established relations with the People's Republic of China on 1 August 1955, and relations since have been based on the [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]]. Nepal has aided China in the aftermath of the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]], and China has provided economic assistance for Nepali infrastructure.

Agriculture employs 76% of the workforce, services 18% and manufacturing and craft-based industry 6%. Agricultural produce&nbsp;– mostly grown in the Terai region bordering India&nbsp;– includes tea, rice, corn, wheat, sugarcane, [[root crop]]s, milk, and [[water buffalo]] meat. Industry mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce, including [[jute]], sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Its workforce of about 10 million suffers from a severe shortage of skilled labour.

Nepal's economic growth continues to be adversely affected by the political uncertainty. Nevertheless, real GDP growth was estimated to increase to almost 5 percent for 2011–2012.

In a recent survey, Nepal has performed extremely well in reducing poverty along with Rwanda and Bangladesh as the percentage of poor dropped to 44.2 percent of the population in 2011 from 64.7 percent in 2006—4.1 percentage points per year, which means that Nepal has made improvement in sectors like nutrition, child mortality, electricity, improved flooring and assets.

The spectacular landscape and diverse, exotic cultures of Nepal represent considerable potential for [[Tourism in Nepal|tourism]], but growth in the industry has been stifled by political instability and poor infrastructure.

The government's budget is about $1.153 billion, with an expenditure of $1.789 billion (FY 20005/06). The [[Nepalese rupee|Nepali rupee]] has been tied to the [[Indian rupee]] at an exchange rate of 1.6 for many years.

Nepal's exports of mainly carpets, clothing, [[hemp]], leather goods, [[jute]] goods and grain total $822 million. Import commodities of mainly gold, machinery and equipment, petroleum products and fertilizer total US$2 billion. [[European Union]] (EU) (46.13%), the US (17.4%), and Germany (7.1%) are its main export partners. The European Union has emerged the largest buyer of Nepali ready-made garments (RMG).

[[File:Kaligandaki A HPS Tailrace Channel.jpg|thumb|Middle Marshyandi Hydroelectricity Dam. Nepal has significant potential to generate [[hydropower]], which it plans to export across South Asia]]

Only about 1% energy need is fulfilled by electricity. The perennial nature of Nepali rivers and the steep gradient of the country's topography provide ideal conditions for the development of some of the world's largest hydroelectric projects. Current estimates put Nepal's economically feasible hydropower potential to be approximately 83,000 MW from 66 hydropower project sites.<ref name="USAID SARI" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Power and People |url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2011/08/11/000333037_20110811014711/Rendered/PDF/636670PUB0Rene00Box0361524B0PUBLIC0.pdf |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref> However, currently Nepal has been able to exploit only about 600 MW from 20 medium to large hydropower plants and a number of small and micro hydropower plants.<ref name="Independent Power Producers' Association, Nepal" /> There are 9 major hydropower plants under construction, and additional 27 sites considered for potential development.<ref name="Independent Power Producers' Association, Nepal" />
Only about 40% of Nepal's population has access to electricity.<ref name="Independent Power Producers' Association, Nepal" /> There is a great disparity between urban and rural areas.

=== Transport ===
{{Main|Transport in Nepal}}
[[File:Yak Nepal.jpg|thumb|Means of transport in mountainous area]]
Nepal remains isolated from the world's major land, air and sea transport routes although, within the country, aviation is in a better state, with 47 airports, 11 of them with paved runways;<ref name="World Factbook">{{cite web |title=World Factbook: Nepal |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/np.html#People |accessdate=30 July 2012}}</ref> flights are frequent and support a sizeable traffic. The hilly and mountainous terrain in the northern two-thirds of the country has made the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. In 2007 there were just over {{convert|10142|km|0|abbr=on}} of paved roads, and {{convert|7140|km|0|abbr=on}} of unpaved road, and one {{convert|59|km|0|abbr=on}} railway line in the south.<ref name="World Factbook" />

More than one-third of its people live at least a two hours walk from the nearest all-season road. Only recently all district headquarters (except for Simikot and Dunai) became reachable by road from Kathmandu. In addition, around 60% of the road network and most rural roads are not operable during the rainy season.<ref>{{cite web |title=Connecting Nepal's Rural Poor to Markets |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2009/12/17/connecting-nepals-rural-poor-to-markets |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref> The only practical seaport of entry for goods bound for Kathmandu is [[Kolkata]] in [[West Bengal]] state of India.

=== Telecommunications and mass media ===
According to the Nepal Telecommunication Authority MIS May 2012 report,<ref name="NTA MIS Report, May 2012">{{cite web |title=Nepal Telecommunication Authority, Management Information System Report, April 2012 |url=http://www.nta.gov.np/en/?option=com_joomdoc&view=documents&Itemid=134 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> there are seven operators and the total voice telephony subscribers including fixed and mobile are 16,350,946, which gives a penetration rate of 61.42%. The fixed telephone service account for 9.37%, mobile for 64.63%, and other services (LM, GMPCS) for 3.76% of the total penetration rate. Similarly, the numbers of subscribers to data/internet services are 4,667,536, which represents 17.53% penetration rate. Most of the data service is accounted by GPRS users. Twelve months earlier the data/internet penetration was 10.05%, thus this represents a growth rate of 74.77%.<ref name="NTA MIS Report, May 2012" />

Not only has there been strong subscriber growth, especially in the mobile sector, but there was evidence of a clear vision in the sector, including putting a reform process in place and planning for the building of necessary telecommunications infrastructure. Most importantly, the Ministry of Information and Communications (MoIC) and the telecom regulator, the National Telecommunications Authority (NTA), have both been very active in the performance of their respective roles.<ref name="Nepal ICT Forecasts">{{cite web |title=Nepal&nbsp;– Telecoms, Mobile, Internet and Forecasts |url=http://www.budde.com.au/Research/Nepal-Telecoms-Mobile-Internet-and-Forecasts.html |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref>

Despite all the effort, there remained a significant disparity between the high coverage levels in the cities and the coverage available in the underdeveloped rural regions. Progress on providing some minimum access had been good. Of a total of 3,914 village development committees across the country, 306 were unserved by December 2009.<ref name="Nepal ICT Forecasts" /> In order to meet future demand, it was estimated that Nepal needed to invest around US$135 million annually in its telecom sector.<ref name="Nepal ICT Forecasts" /> In 2009, the telecommunication sector alone contributed to 1% of the nation's GDP.<ref name="World Bank&nbsp;— Nepal's ICT at a glance">{{cite web |title=World Bank&nbsp;– Nepal's ICT at a glance |url=http://devdata.worldbank.org/ict/npl_ict.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207205000/http://devdata.worldbank.org/ict/npl_ict.pdf |archivedate=7 December 2006}}</ref> As of 30 September 2012, Nepal has 1,828,700 Facebook users.<ref name="Internet Stats">{{cite web |title=Internet World Stats: Asia |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats3.htm |accessdate=14 November 2012}}</ref>

Historical kingdoms that existed in the Kathmandu valley are found to have made use of some clever technologies in numerous areas such as architecture, agriculture, civil engineering, water management, etc. The Gopals and Abhirs, who ruled the valley up until {{circa}} 1000 BC, used temporary materials for construction such as bamboo, hay, timber, etc. The [[Kirata Kingdom|Kirat]] period (700 BC – 110 AD) employed the technology of brick firing as well as produced quality woolen shawls. Similarly, [[stupa]]s, idols, canals, self-recharging ponds, reservoirs, etc. constructed during the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Lichhavi]] era (110–879 AD) are intact to this day, which manifests the ingenuity of traditional architecture. Moreover, the [[Malla (Nepal)|Malla]] period (1200–1768 AD) saw an impressive growth in architecture, on par with its advanced contemporaries. An archetypal example of Malla architecture is [[Nyatapola]], a five-storied, 30-metre tall temple in Bhaktapur, which has strangely survived at least four major earthquakes, including the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].<ref name="unesco">{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001461/146117e.pdf |title=Science, Research and Technology in Nepal |date=2006 |website=unesco.org |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |pages=3–6 |author1=[[Dayananda Bajracharya]] |author2=Dinesh Raj Bhuju |author3=Jiba Raj Pokhrel |accessdate=18 October 2016}}</ref>

Nepal was a late entrant into the modern world of science and technology. Nepal's first institution of higher education, [[Tri-Chandra College]], was established by [[Chandra Shumsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Chandra Shumsher]] in 1918. The college introduced science at the Intermediate level a year later, marking the genesis of formal [[science education]] in the country.<ref name="unesco" /> However, the college was not accessible to the general public, but only to a handful of members of the [[Rana dynasty|Rana regime]]. Throughout the Rana regime that lasted for well over a century, Nepal was effectively isolated from the rest of the world. Owing to this isolation, Nepal was relatively untouched by and unfamiliar of social transformations brought about by the [[British Raj|British invasion]] in [[India]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]] in the West.<ref name="sts">{{cite journal |url=http://sts.sagepub.com/content/6/1/159.abstract |title=Development of Science and Technology in Nepal |date=March 2001 |journal=Science, Technology and Society |volume=6 |pages=159–178 |accessdate=17 October 2016 |author1=Ramesh M.

An underdeveloped country, Nepal is plagued with problems such as [[poverty]], [[illiteracy]], [[unemployment]], and the like. Consequently, science and technology have invariably lagged behind in the priority list of the government. On the other hand, citing poor university education at home, tens of thousands of Nepali students leave the country every year, with half of them never returning.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://admin.myrepublica.com/society/story/23904/more-students-seeking-no-objection-to-study-abroad.html |title=More students seeking ‘no objection’ to study abroad |last=Sharma |first=Nirjana |date=3 July 2015 |work=[[República (Nepalese newspaper)|Republica]] |access-date=20 October 2016 |via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://nepalitimes.com/regular-columns/Between-the-lines/More-Nepali-students-settle-overseas,528 |title=Losing our young |last=Tsering |first=Dolker |date=17 July 2015 |work=[[Nepali Times]] |access-date=20 October 2016 |via=}}</ref> These factors have been huge deterrents to the development of science and technology in Nepal.

=== Community forestry ===
The Community Forestry Program in Nepal is a participatory environmental governance that encompasses well-defined policies, institutions, and practices. The program addresses the twin goals of forest conservation and poverty reduction. As more than 70 percent of Nepal's population depends on agriculture for their livelihood, community management of forests has been a critically important intervention. Through legislative developments and operational innovations over three decades, the program has evolved from a protection-oriented, conservation-focused agenda to a much more broad-based strategy for forest use, enterprise development, and livelihood improvement. By April 2009, one-third of Nepal's population was participating in the program, directly managing more than one-fourth of Nepal's forest area.<ref name="Community forestry in Nepal, IFPRI">{{cite web |title=Community forestry in Nepal |url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp00913.pdf |accessdate=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref name="Forestry Nepal">{{cite web |title=Community Forestry |url=http://www.forestrynepal.org/wiki/137 |accessdate=19 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218154118/http://www.forestrynepal.org/wiki/137 |archivedate=18 February 2013 }}</ref>

The immediate livelihood benefits derived by rural households bolster strong collective action wherein local communities actively and sustainably manage forest resources. Community forests also became the source of diversified investment capital and raw material for new market-oriented livelihoods. Community forestry shows traits of political, financial, and ecological sustainability, including an emergence of a strong legal and regulatory framework, and robust civil society institutions and networks. However, a continuing challenge is to ensure equitable distribution of benefits to women and marginalized groups. Lessons for replication emphasise experiential learning, establishment of a strong civil society network, flexible regulation to encourage diverse institutional modalities, and responsiveness of government and policymakers to a multistakeholder collaborative learning process.<ref name="Community Forestry in Nepal, Satoyama">{{cite web |title=Community Forestry in Nepal |url=http://satoyama-initiative.org/en/case_studies-2/area_asia-2/community-forestry-in-nepal-shankar-adhikari-forest-officer-district-forest-office-lalitpur-nepal/ |accessdate=19 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606222922/http://satoyama-initiative.org/en/case_studies-2/area_asia-2/community-forestry-in-nepal-shankar-adhikari-forest-officer-district-forest-office-lalitpur-nepal/ |archivedate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="Forestry Nepal, IRIN">{{cite web |title=NEPAL: Community forest value untapped |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/96394/NEPAL-Community-forest-value-untapped |accessdate=19 January 2013|date=25 September 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:NepalPopulationEnglishGraph.svg|thumb|Comparison Of Nepal Population]]
[[File:Bevölkerungspyramide Nepal 2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid 2016]]
According to the 2011 census, Nepal's population grew from 9 million people in 1950 to 26.5 million. From 2001 to 2011, the average family size declined from 5.44 to 4.9. The census also noted some 1.9 million absentee people, over a million more than in 2001; most are male labourers employed overseas, predominantly in South Asia and the Middle East. This correlated with the drop in sex ratio from 94.41 as compared to 99.80 for 2001. The annual population growth rate is 1.35%.<ref name=pre-cen />

The citizens of Nepal are known as [[Nepali people|Nepali]] or Nepalese. The country is home to people of many different national origins. As a result, ''Nepalese'' do not equate their nationality with [[ethnic groups in Nepal|ethnicity]], but with [[citizenship]] and [[allegiance]].
Although citizens make up the majority of Nepalese, non-citizen residents, dual citizens, and expatriates may also claim a Nepalese identity.
Nepal is multicultural and multiethnic country because it became a country by occupying several small kingdoms such as [[Mustang District|Mustang]], [[Videha]] ([[Mithila (ancient)|Mithila]]), [[Madhesh]], and [[Limbuwan]] in the 18th century. The oldest settlements in [[Mithila, Nepal|Mithila]] and [[Tharuhat]] are [[Maithil]]. Northern Nepal is historically inhabited by Kirants [[Mongoloid]], [[Rai (ethnic group)|Rai]] and [[Limbu]] people. The mountainous region is sparsely populated above {{convert |3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, but in central and western Nepal ethnic [[Sherpa people|Sherpa]] and [[Lama]]people inhabit even higher semi-arid valleys north of the Himalaya. The Nepali speaking [[Khas people]] mostly inhabit central and southern regions. [[Kathmandu Valley]], in the middle hill region, constitutes a small fraction of the nation's area but is the most densely populated, with almost 5 percent of the nation's population.
The Nepali are descendants of three major migrations from India, [[Tibet]], and North Burma and the Chinese province of [[Yunnan]] via [[Assam]]. Among the earliest inhabitants were the [[Kirat]] of east mid-region, [[Newar]]s of the [[Kathmandu Valley]], aboriginal [[Tharu people|Tharus]] of [[Tharuhat]],

Despite the migration of a significant section of the population to the [[Madhesh]] (southern plains) in recent years, the majority of Nepalese still live in the central highlands; the northern mountains are sparsely populated. Kathmandu, with a population of over 2.6 million (metropolitan area: 5 million),{{dubious|date=April 2015}} is the largest city in the country and the cultural and economic heart.

According to the ''World Refugee Survey 2008'', published by the US Committee for [[Refugees]] and Immigrants, Nepal hosted a population of refugees and asylum seekers in 2007 numbering approximately 130,000. Of this population, approximately 109,200 persons were from Bhutan and 20,500 from People's Republic of China.<ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008">{{Cite news |title=World Refugee Survey 2008 |publisher=U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants |date=19 June 2008 |url=http://www.refugees.org/survey |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005040657/http://www.refugees.org/article.aspx?id=1941 |archivedate=5 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Damakant |last=Jayshi |agency=Inter Press Service |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41818 |title=NEPAL: Tibetans Warned of Deportation to China |date=1 April 2008 |accessdate=14 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609162646/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=41818 |archivedate=9 June 2012 |df=}}</ref> The government of Nepal restricted [[Bhutanese refugees]] to seven camps in the [[Jhapa]] and [[Morang]] districts, and refugees were not permitted to work in most professions.<ref name="World Refugee Survey 2008" /> At present, the United States is working towards resettling more than 60,000 of these refugees in the US.<ref name="Bhutan">{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7082586.stm |title=Bhutan refugees are 'intimidated' |author=Bhaumik, Subir |date=7 November 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=25 April 2008}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Nepal}}
Nepal's diverse linguistic heritage stems from three major language groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman]], and various [[indigenous language]] isolates. The major languages of Nepal (percent spoken as native language) according to the 2011 census are [[Nepali language|Nepali]] (44.6%), [[Maithili language|Maithili]] (11.7%), [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] (6.0%), [[Tharu language|Tharu]] (5.8%), [[Tamang language|Tamang]] (5.1%), [[Nepal Bhasa]] (3.2%), [[Bajjika dialect|Bajjika]] (3%) and [[Magar language|Magar]] (3.0%), [[Doteli language|Doteli]] (3.0%), [[Urdu]] (2.6%), [[Awadhi]] (1.89%), and [[Sunwar language|Sunwar]]. Nepal is home to at least four indigenous [[Nepali Sign Language|sign languages]].

Derived from [[Sanskrit]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] is written in [[Devanagari]] script. Nepali is the official language and serves as ''lingua franca'' among Nepali of different ethnolinguistic groups. The regional languages [[Maithili language|Maithili]],
[[Awadhi language|Awadhi]], Bhojpuri and rarely [[Urdu]] of [[Nepali Muslims]] are spoken in the southern [[Madhesh]] region. Many Nepali in government and business speak [[Maithili language|Maithili]] as the main language and [[Nepali language|Nepali]] as their de facto ''lingua franca''. [[Tibetic languages|Varieties of Tibetan]] are spoken in and north of the higher Himalaya where standard literary Tibetan is widely understood by those with religious education. Local dialects in the Terai and hills are mostly unwritten with efforts underway to develop systems for writing many in Devanagari or the Roman alphabet.

According to Hindu mythology, the goddess [[Sita]] of the epic [[Ramayana]], was born in the Mithila Kingdom of King Janaka Raja.

[[Lumbini]] is a [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site and UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in the [[Kapilvastu District|Kapilavastu]] district. Traditionally it is held to be the birthplace in about 563 B.C. of [[Siddhartha Gautama]], a Kshatriya caste prince of the Sakya clan, who as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha Gautama]], founded [[Buddhism]].

The holy site of Lumbini is bordered by a large monastic zone, in which only monasteries can be built.

The overall literacy rate (for population age 5 years and above) increased from 54.1% in 2001 to 65.9% in 2011. The male literacy rate was 75.1% compared to the female literacy rate of 57.4%. The highest literacy rate was reported in Kathmandu district (86.3%) and lowest in [[Rautahat District|Rautahat]] (41.7%).<ref name=pre-cen /> While the net primary enrolment rate was 74% in 2005;<ref name="undp">{{cite web |url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/NPL.html |title=Human Development Report 2010&nbsp;– Nepal |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org |accessdate=25 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415135354/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/NPL.html |archivedate=15 April 2012 }}</ref> in 2009, that enrolment rate was 90%.<ref name="worldbank">{{cite web |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22323571~pagePK:64257043~piPK:437376~theSitePK:4607,00.html?cid=3001 |title=News & Broadcast&nbsp;– World Bank Supports School Sector Reforms in Nepal |publisher=World Bank |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref>

However, increasing access to secondary education (grade 9–12) remains a major challenge, as evidenced by the low net enrolment rate of 24% at this level. More than half of primary students do not enter secondary schools, and only one-half of them complete secondary schooling. In addition, fewer girls than boys join secondary schools and, among those who do, fewer complete the 10th grade.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/nepal/overview |title=Nepal&nbsp;– Overview |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref>

Nepal has seven universities: [[Tribhuvan University]], [[Kathmandu University]], [[Pokhara University]], [[Purbanchal University]], [[Mahendra Sanskrit University]], [[Far-western University]], and [[Agriculture and Forestry University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://afu.edu.np |title=Agriculture and Forestry University.

=== Largest cities ===
As Nepal is one of the [[Developing country|developing countries]], its cities, like other aspects, are growing. More than 20% of the population live in urban areas. The capital, [[Kathmandu]], is the largest city and is called the "City of Temples" for its numerous temples of Hindu and Buddhist gods and goddess. One of the oldest cities of South Asia, Katmandu has five [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Sites, palaces and historically important sites such as [[Singha Durbar]]. The other large cities of Nepal are [[Pokhara]], [[Biratnagar]], [[Lalitpur, Nepal|Lalitpur]], [[Bharatpur, Nepal|Bharatpur]], [[Birgunj]], [[Dharan, Nepal|Dharan]], [[Hetauda]] and [[Nepalgunj]].

[[File:Manisha Koirala still2.jpg|thumb|The Nepalese actress and [[UN Goodwill Ambassador]] [[Manisha Koirala]]]]
Folklore is an integral part of Nepali society. Traditional stories are rooted in the reality of day-to-day life, tales of love, affection and battles as well as demons and ghosts and thus reflect local lifestyles, culture, and beliefs. Many Nepali folktales are enacted through the medium of dance and music.

Most houses in the rural lowlands of Nepal are made up of a tight [[bamboo]] framework and walls of a mud and cow-dung mix. These dwellings remain cool in summer and retain warmth in winter. Houses in the hills are usually made of unbaked bricks with thatch or tile roofing. At high elevations construction changes to stone masonry and slate may be used on roofs.

[[Flag of Nepal|Nepal's flag]] is the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular in shape.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/flags/flagtemplate_np.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410060127/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/flags/flagtemplate_np.html |archivedate=10 April 2011 |title=Flag Description}}</ref> The constitution of Nepal contains instructions for a geometric construction of the flag.<ref>compare [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/np01000_.html this copy of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501104849/http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/np01000_.html |date=1 May 2016 }}</ref> According to its official description, the red in the flag stands for victory in war or courage, and is also the colour of the [[rhododendron]], the national flower of Nepal. Red also stands for aggression. The flag's blue border signifies peace. The curved moon on the flag is a symbol of the peaceful and calm nature of Nepali, while the sun represents the aggressiveness of Nepali warriors.

=== Holidays and festivals ===
{{Main|List of festivals in Nepal}}

With [[Public holidays in Nepal|36 days a year]], Nepal is the country that enjoys the most number of [[public holiday]]s in the world.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jha |first1=Manish |title=Regular breaks |url=http://nepalitimes.com/regular-columns/Economic-Class/regular-breaks,788 |website=[[Nepali Times]] |accessdate=14 October 2016 |date=7 October 2016}}</ref> The Nepali year begins in 1st of [[Baisakh]] in official [[Hindu Calendar]] of the country, the [[Bikram Sambat]], which falls in mid-April and is divided into 12 months.

=== Units of measurement ===
{{Main|Nepalese customary units of measurement}}
Although the country has adopted the [[metric system]] as its official standard since 1968,<ref name="standard">{{cite web |title=Standard Measurement and Weight Act, 1968 |url=http://nbsm.gov.np/ne/%E0%A4%90%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AE/ |publisher=Nepal Bureau of Standards and Metrology |accessdate=31 December 2016 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510082304/http://nbsm.gov.np/ne/%E0%A4%90%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AF%E0%A4%AE/ |archivedate=10 May 2017 }}</ref> traditional units of measurement are still commonplace. The customary units of area employed in the [[Terai]] region – such as [[Katha (unit)|katha]], [[bigha]], etc. – sound similar to those used elsewhere in [[South Asia]]. However, they vary markedly in size, as they seem to have been standardized to different measures of area. For instance, a katha in Nepal is arbitrarily set at 338.63 m<sup>2</sup>, while a katha in [[Bangladesh]] means about 67&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> of land area. In addition to native ones, imperial units pertaining to length (specifically [[inch]] and [[foot]]) and metric units such as [[kilogram]] and [[litre]] are also fairly common in everyday trade and commerce.

Modern Romania was formed in 1859 through a [[personal union]] of the [[United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia|Danubian Principalities]] of [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]]. The new state, officially named Romania since 1866, gained independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1877. Following [[World War I]], when Romania fought on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied powers]], [[Bukovina]], [[Bessarabia]], [[Transylvania]] as well as parts of [[Banat]], [[Crișana]], and [[Maramureș]] became part of the sovereign [[Kingdom of Romania]]. In June–August 1940, as a consequence of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Second Vienna Award]], Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the [[Soviet Union]], and [[Northern Transylvania]] to Hungary. In November 1940, Romania signed the [[Tripartite Pact]] and, consequently, in June 1941 entered [[World War II]] on the [[Axis powers|Axis side]], fighting against the Soviet Union until August 1944, when it [[King Michael's Coup|joined]] the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and recovered Northern Transylvania. Following the war, under the occupation of the [[Red Army]]'s forces, Romania became a [[Socialist Republic of Romania|socialist republic]] and member of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. After the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]], Romania [[History of Romania since 1989|began a transition]] back towards [[democracy]] and a [[market economy]].

Two spelling forms: ''român'' and ''rumân'' were used interchangeably<ref group=lower-alpha>''"am scris aceste sfente cărți de învățături, să fie popilor rumânesti&nbsp;... să înțeleagă toți oamenii cine-s rumâni creștini"'' "Întrebare creștinească" (1559), Bibliografia românească veche, IV, 1944, p. 6. <br />''"...&nbsp;că văzum cum toate limbile au și înfluresc întru cuvintele slăvite a lui Dumnezeu numai noi românii pre limbă nu avem.

Princes [[Mircea I of Wallachia|Mircea I]] and [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III of Wallachia]], and [[Stephen the Great|Stephen III of Moldavia]] defended their countries independence against the Ottomans, but most Wallachian and Moldavian princes paid a regular tribute to the Ottoman sultans from 1417 and 1456, respectively.{{sfn|Hitchins|1991|pp=26–29}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=60–61, 63–66}} A military commander of Romanian origin, [[John Hunyadi]], organized the defence of the Kingdom of Hungary until his death in 1456.{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=61–62}} Increasing taxes outraged the Transylvanian peasants and [[Transylvanian peasant revolt|they rose up in an open rebellion]] in 1437, but the Hungarian nobles and the heads of the Saxon and Székely communities jointly pushed their revolt.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=30–31}} The formal alliance of the Hungarian, Saxon and Székely leaders, known as the [[Unio Trium Nationum|Union of the Three Nations]], became an important element of the self-government of Transylvania.{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=52–53}} The Orthodox Romanian ''[[Knez (Vlach leader)|knezes]]'' (or chiefs) were excluded from the Union.{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=52–53}}

The Kingdom of Hungary collapsed and the Ottomans occupied parts of Banat and Crișana in 1541.{{sfn|Pop|1999|pp=52–53}} Transylvania and [[Maramureș]], along with the rest of Banat and Crișana developed into a new state under Ottoman suzerainty, the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]].{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=41}} Reformation spread and four denominations{{mdash}}[[Reformed Church in Romania|Calvinism]], [[Evangelical Church of Augustan Confession in Romania|Lutheranism]], [[Unitarian Church of Transylvania|Unitarianism]] and Roman Catholicism{{mdash}}were officially acknowledged in 1568.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=69}} The Romanians' Orthodox faith remained only tolerated,{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=69}} although they made up more than one-third of the population, according to 17th-century estimations.{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|p=419}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=71}}

The united armies of the [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] expelled the Ottoman troops from Central Europe between 1684 and 1699 and the Principality of Transylvania was integrated in the [[Habsburg Empire]].{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=79}} The Habsburgs supported the Catholic clergy and persuaded the Orthodox Romanian prelates to accept the [[church union|union with the Roman Catholic Church]] in 1699.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|p=42}} The Church Union strengthened the Romanian intellectuals' devotion to their Roman heritage.{{sfn|Hitchins|1991|p=60}} The Orthodox Church was restored in Transylvania only after Orthodox monks stirred up revolts in 1744 and 1759.{{sfn|Hitchins|1991|p=61}} The organization of the [[Transylvanian Military Frontier]] caused further disturbances, [[Siculicidium|especially among the Székelys in 1764]].{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|pp=432–434}}

Princes [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] of Moldavia and [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]] of Wallachia concluded alliances with the Habsburg Empire and Russia against the Ottomans, but they were dethroned in 1711 and 1714, respectively.{{sfn|Hitchins|1991|pp=44–45}} The sultans lost confidence in the native princes and appointed Orthodox merchants from the [[Fener|Phanar]] district of Istanbul to rule Moldova and Wallachia.{{sfn|Hitchins|1991|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=73–74}} The [[Phanariotes|Phanariot]] princes pursued oppressive fiscal policies and dissolved the army.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=74–75, 78}} The neighboring powers take advantage of the situation: the Habsburg Empire annexed northern Moldavia, or [[Bucovina]], in 1775, and Russia seized [[Bessarabia]] in 1812.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=92}}{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=75–76}}

A census revealed that the Romanians were more numerous than any of the other ethnic groups in Transylvania in 1733, but legislation continued to use contemptuous adjectives (such as "tolerated" and "admitted") when referring to them.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=87}}{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|pp=427–428}} The [[Romanian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate bishop]], [[Inocențiu Micu-Klein]] who demanded the recognition of the Romanians as the fourth privileged nation was forced into exile.{{sfn|Georgescu|1991|pp=89–90}}{{sfn|Trócsányi|Miskolczy|1994|pp=427–428}} Uniate and Orthodox clerics and laymen jointly signed a [[Supplex Libellus Valachorum|plea for the Transylvanian Romanians' emancipation]] in 1791, but the monarch and the local authorities denied to grant their requests.{{sfn|Hitchins|1991|pp=73–74}}{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=87}}

[[Mihail Kogălniceanu]], [[Nicolae Bălcescu]] and other leaders of the [[Moldavian Revolution of 1848|1848 revolutions in Moldavia]] and [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Wallachia]] demanded the emancipation of the peasants and the union of the two principalities, but Russian and Ottoman troops crushed their revolt.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=99}}{{sfn|Hitchins|1991|pp=96–97}} The Wallachian revolutioners were the first to adopt the blue, yellow and red [[Tricolour (flag)|tricolor]] as [[Flag of Romania|national flag]].{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=100}} In Transylvania, most Romanians supported the imperial government against the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848|Hungarian revolutioners]] after the Diet passed a law about the union of Transylvania and Hungary.{{sfn|Pop|1999|p=100}} Bishop [[Andrei Șaguna]] proposed the unification of the Romanians of the Habsburg Empire in a separate duchy, but the central government refused to change the internal frontiers.{{sfn|Hitchins|1991|p=99}}

The [[Constitution of Romania]] is based on the [[Constitution of France]]'s Fifth Republic and was approved in a national referendum on 8 December 1991, and amended in October 2003 to bring it into conformity with the EU legislation. The country is governed on the basis of a multi-party democratic system and the separation of powers between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.

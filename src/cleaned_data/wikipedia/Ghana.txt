'''Ghana''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Ghana.ogg|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|n|ə}}), officially the '''Republic of Ghana''', is a country located along the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]], in the [[subregion]] of [[West Africa]]. Spanning a [[land mass]] of {{convert|238535|km2|abbr=on}}, Ghana is bordered by the [[Ivory Coast]] in the west, [[Burkina Faso]] in the north, [[Togo]] in the east and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the south. ''Ghana'' means "Warrior King" in the [[Soninke language]].<ref name="warriorking">Jackson, John G. (2001) ''Introduction to African Civilizations'', Citadel Press, p. 201, {{ISBN|0-8065-2189-9}}.</ref>

The first permanent state in the territory of present-day Ghana dates back to the 11th century. Numerous kingdoms and empires emerged over the centuries, of which the most powerful was the [[Kingdom of Ashanti]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Asante Kingdom|url=http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/webdossiers/asante-kingdom|publisher=[[Afrika-Studiecentrum, Leiden]]|accessdate=8 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712214333/http://www.ascleiden.nl/content/webdossiers/asante-kingdom|archive-date=12 July 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Beginning in the 15th century, numerous European powers contested the area for trading rights, with the [[British Empire|British]] ultimately establishing control of the coast by the late 19th century. Following over a century of native resistance, Ghana's current borders were established by the 1900s as the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|British Gold Coast]].

Ghana was already recognized as one of the great kingdoms in [[Bilad el-Sudan]] by the ninth century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Levtzion|first1=Nehemia|title=Ancient Ghana and Mali|date=1973|publisher=Methuen & Co Ltd|location=New York|isbn=0841904316|page=3}}</ref>

Ghana was inhabited in the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Age of Discovery]] by a number of ancient predominantly [[Akan people|Akan]] kingdoms in the Southern and Central territories. This included the [[Ashanti Empire]], the [[Akwamu]], the [[Bonoman]], the [[Denkyira]], and the [[Mankessim Kingdom]].<ref>Title: Africa a Voyage of Discovery with Basil Davidson, Language: English Type: Documentary Year: 1984 Length: 114 min.</ref>

Although the area of present-day Ghana in West Africa has experienced many population movements, the [[Akan people|Akans]] were firmly settled by the 5th century BC.<ref name=col>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/history/pre-colonial.php|title=Pre-Colonial Period|publisher=Ghanaweb.com|accessdate=13 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123235900/http://ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/history/pre-colonial.php|archive-date=23 November 2010|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2013-4%20-%20Pre-European%20Gold%20Mining%20at%20Ashanti,%20Ghana.pdf|title=Pre-European Mining at Ashanti, Ghana|type=PDF|publisher=Pdmhs.com|date=October 1996|accessdate=24 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141122214748/http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2013-4%20-%20Pre-European%20Gold%20Mining%20at%20Ashanti,%20Ghana.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2014}}</ref> By the early 11th century, the Akans were firmly established in the Akan state called [[Bonoman]], for which the [[Brong-Ahafo Region]] is named.<ref name=col/><ref>{{cite book|author1=Tvedten, Ige|author2=Hersoug, Bjørn|title=Fishing for Development: Small Scale Fisheries in Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Itt1hIbsbQsC&pg=PA60|year=1992|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute|isbn=978-91-7106-327-4|pages=60–|access-date=27 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912143828/https://books.google.com/books?id=Itt1hIbsbQsC&pg=PA60|archive-date=12 September 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

From the 13th century, Akans emerged from what is believed to have been the Bonoman area, to create several Akan states of Ghana, mainly based on gold trading.<ref>The Techiman-Bono of Ghana: an ethnography of an Akan society Kendall/Hunt Pub.

Ghana is a [[Unitary executive theory|unitary]] [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[constitutional democracy]] with a parliamentary [[multi-party system]]. Ghana alternated between civilian and military governments until January 1993, when the military government gave way to the Fourth Republic of Ghana after [[Ghanaian presidential election, 1992|presidential]] and [[Ghanaian parliamentary election, 1992|parliamentary elections]] in late 1992. The 1992 [[constitution of Ghana]] divides powers among a [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the [[Ghana Armed Forces]] ([[President of Ghana]]), parliament ([[Parliament of Ghana]]), cabinet ([[Cabinet of Ghana]]), council of state ([[Council of State (Ghana)|Ghanaian Council of State]]), and an independent judiciary ([[Judiciary of Ghana]]).

Nkrumah was a Ghanaian nationalist leader who led the country from 1957 to 1966. Nkrumah's political journey started when he entered [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in Pennsylvania in 1935. He graduated with master's degrees from Lincoln University and the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. He formed the Convention Peoples' Party. The party initiated a "positive action" campaign involving non-violent protests, strikes and non-cooperation with the British authorities. Nkrumah was arrested and sentenced to one year imprisonment during this time. In the Gold Coast's February 1951 general election, he was elected to Parliament and released from prison to become leader of government business. He became Prime Minister of the Gold Coast in 1952s leadership was authoritarian but he improved the infrastructure of the country and his Africanisation policies created better career opportunities for Ghanaians. He was deposed in a coup in 1966.

===Overview===
Ghanaian education system is divided in three parts:Basic Education, secondary cycle and tertiary education. "Basic Education" lasts 11 years (ages 4‒15).<ref name="GEScurr"/> It is divided into [[Kindergarten]] (2 years), Primary School (2 module of 3 years) and Junior High (3 years). Junior High School (JHS) ends with the Basic Education Certificate Examination ([[BECE]]).<ref name="GEScurr">{{cite web|url=http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=content/basic-education-curriculum-1|title=Basic Education Curriculum|publisher=Ghana Education Service|accessdate=6 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195225/http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=content%2Fbasic-education-curriculum-1|archivedate=25 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="GEScurr2">{{cite web|url=http://www.ges.gov.gh/?q=content/basic-education-curriculum|title=Basic curriculum Education: The junior High Education|publisher=Ghana Education Service|accessdate=6 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605133413/http://ges.gov.gh/?q=content%2Fbasic-education-curriculum|archivedate=5 June 2014}}</ref> Once the BECE achieved, the pupil can pursue into secondary cycle.<ref name="BECE">{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/BECE.aspx|title=BECE|accessdate=6 June 2014|author=West African Examinations Council(corporate site: Ghana)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519130523/http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/BECE.aspx|archivedate=19 May 2014}}</ref> Hence, the pupil has the choice between general education (assumed by Senior High School) and vocational education (assumed by technical Senior High School, Technical and Vocational Institutes, completed by a massive private and informal offer). Senior High School lasts three years and ends on the West African Secondary School Certificate Examination ([[WASSCE]]). The WASSCE is prerequisite to be enrolled into a university bachelor's degree programme.{{sfn|NUFFIC|2013|page=7}} Polytechnics are opened to vocational students, from SHS or from TVI.<ref name="UNEVOC">{{cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=GHA|title=Vocational Education in Ghana|publisher=UNESCO-UNEVOC|date=July 2012|accessdate=23 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523230631/http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=GHA|archive-date=23 May 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Casely Hayford]], [[Ayi Kwei Armah]] and [[Nii Ayikwei Parkes]], who gained international acclaim with the books, ''Ethiopia Unbound'' (1911), ''[[The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born]]'' (1968) and ''Tail of the Blue Bird'' (2009), respectively.<ref name="LIT">{{cite web |work= Amadeus |url= http://www.amadeus.net/home/destinations/es/guides/gh/cul.htm |title= Ghana |language= Spanish |accessdate= 1 August 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150223225901/https://www.amadeus.net/home/destinations/es/guides/gh/cul.htm |archive-date= 23 February 2015 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}</ref> In addition to novels, other literature arts such as Ghanaian theatre and poetry have also had a very good development and support at the national level with prominent Ghanaian playwrights and poets [[Joe de Graft]] and [[Efua Sutherland]].<ref name="LIT"/>

===Adinkra===
{{Main|Adinkra symbols}}
[[File:Adinkra motifs Rattray 1927.jpg|thumb|[[Adinkra symbols]] by [[Robert Sutherland Rattray]]]]

During the 13th century, Ghanaians developed their unique art of ''[[Adinkra symbols|adinkra]]'' printing. Hand-printed and hand-[[Embroidery|embroidered]] adinkra clothes were made and used exclusively by the then Ghanaian royalty for devotional ceremonies. Each of the [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] that make up the [[Text corpus|corpus]] of adinkra symbolism has a name and meaning derived from a proverb, a historical event, human attitude, [[ethology]], [[plant life-form]], or [[shape]]s of [[inanimate]] and man-made objects. These are graphically rendered in stylised geometric shapes. The meanings of the motifs may be categorised into [[aesthetics]], ethics, [[Interpersonal relationship|human relations]], and concepts.<ref name="LIT"/>

The Adinkra symbols have a decorative function as [[tattoo]]s but also represent objects that encapsulate evocative messages that convey traditional wisdom, aspects of life or the environment. There are many different symbols with distinct meanings, often linked with [[proverb]]s. In the words of [[Anthony Appiah]], they were one of the means in a pre-literate society for "supporting the transmission of a complex and nuanced body of practice and belief".<ref>{{cite book|last=Appiah|first=Kwame Anthony|title=In my father's house : Africa in the philosophy of culture|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-506852-8|edition=1.paperbackedition 1993.|authorlink=Anthony Appiah}}</ref>

===Traditional clothing===
{{Main|Kente cloth}}

Along with the ''Adinkra cloth'' Ghanaians use many different cloth fabrics for their traditional attire.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/> The different ethnic groups have their own individual cloth. The most well known is the [[Kente]] cloth.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/> Kente is a very important Ghanaian [[national costume]] and clothing and these cloths are used to make traditional and modern Ghanaian Kente [[attire]].<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth">{{cite web |url=http://www.kentecloth.net/ghanaian-kente-cloth/ |title=Ghanaian Kente Cloth |publisher=kentecloth.net |accessdate=6 June 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607002652/http://www.kentecloth.net/ghanaian-kente-cloth/ |archive-date=7 June 2014 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Different symbols and different colours mean different things.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/> [[Kente cloth|Kente]] is the most famous of all the Ghanaian cloths.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/> Kente is a ceremonial cloth hand-woven on a horizontal [[Loom|treadle loom]] and strips measuring about 4&nbsp;inches wide are sewn together into larger pieces of cloths.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/> Cloths come in various colours, sizes and designs and are worn during very important social and religious occasions.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/>

In a cultural context, kente is more important than just a cloth and it is a visual representation of history and also a form of written language through weaving.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/> The term kente has its roots in the Akan word ''kɛntɛn'' which means a basket and the first kente weavers used raffia fibres to weave cloths that looked like kenten (a basket); and thus were referred to as ''kenten ntoma''; meaning basket cloth.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/> The original Akan name of the cloth was ''nsaduaso'' or ''nwontoma'', meaning "a cloth hand-woven on a loom"; however, "kente" is the most frequently used term today.<ref name="Ghanaian Kente Cloth"/>

Contemporary Ghanaian fashion includes traditional and modern styles and fabrics and has made its way into the African and global fashion scene. The cloth known as [[African waxprints|African print fabric]] was created out of Dutch wax textiles, it is believed that in the late 1800s, Dutch ships on their way to Asia stocked with machine-made textiles that mimicked Indonesian Batik stopped at many West African ports on the way. The fabrics did not do well in Asia. However, in West Africa – mainly Ghana where there was an already established market for cloths and textiles – the client base grew and it was changed to include local and traditional designs, colours and patterns to cater to the taste of the new consumers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrendesign.com/the-story-behind-african-wax-print-cloth/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925182125/http://thewrendesign.com/the-story-behind-african-wax-print-cloth/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 September 2010|title=The Story Behind African Wax Print Cloth|publisher=Thewrendesign.com|date=10 July 2008|accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref>

Ghana has a budding and thriving film industry. Ghana's film industry dates as far back as 1948 when the Gold Coast Film Unit was set up in the Information Services Department.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gold Coast Film Unit|url=http://www.colonialfilm.org.uk/production-company/gold-coast-film-unit|publisher=Colonialfilm.org.uk|accessdate=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117123221/http://colonialfilm.org.uk/production-company/gold-coast-film-unit|archive-date=17 November 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Some internationally recognised films have come from Ghana. In 1970, ''I Told You So'' was one of the first Ghanaian films to receive international acknowledgement and received great reviews from ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|65873|I Told You So}}</ref> It was followed by the 1973 Ghanaian and Italian production ''The African Deal'' also known as "''Contratto carnale''" featuring [[Bahamian American]] actor [[Calvin Lockhart]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The African Deal (1973)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069917/|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226173418/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069917/|archive-date=26 February 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> 1983's ''Kukurantumi: the Road to Accra'', a Ghanaian and German production directed by King Ampaw, was written about by famous American film critic [[Vincent Canby]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Kukurantumi The Road To Accra (1983)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804EFDE1F39F932A35757C0A962948260|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1 April 1984|accessdate=2 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410144701/http://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9804EFDE1F39F932A35757C0A962948260|archive-date=10 April 2014|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1987, ''[[Cobra Verde]]'', another Ghanaian and German production directed by Werner Herzog, received international acclamation and in 1988, ''Heritage Africa'' won more than 12 film awards.

In recent times there have been collaborations between Ghanaian and Nigerian crew and cast and a number of productions turned out. Many Ghanaian films are co-produced with [[Cinema of Nigeria|Nollywood]], the Nigerian film industry, and some are distributed by Nigerian marketers. Also, Nigerian filmmakers often feature Ghanaian actors and actresses in their movies and Ghanaian filmmakers feature Nigerian actors and actresses in theirs. [[Nadia Buari]], [[Yvonne Nelson]], [[Lydia Forson]] and [[Jackie Appiah]] all popular Ghanaian actresses and [[Van Vicker]] and [[Majid Michel]] both popular Ghanaian actors, have starred in many Nigerian movies. As a result of these collaborations, Western viewers often confuse Ghanaian movies with Nollywood and count their sales as one; however, they are two independent industries that sometimes share ''Nollywood''. In 2009, [[Unesco]] described Nollywood as the second-biggest film industry in the world after [[Bollywood]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article7086248.ece |title=Nollywood success puts Nigeria's film industry in regional spotlight |work=The Times|first=Jonathan|last=Clayton|date=3 April 2010|accessdate=3 April 2010}}</ref>

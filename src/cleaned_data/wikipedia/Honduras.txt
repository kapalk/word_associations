Honduras was home to several important [[Mesoamerican]] cultures, most notably the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish invaded]] in the sixteenth century. The Spanish introduced Roman Catholicism and the now predominant [[Spanish language]], along with numerous customs that have blended with the indigenous culture.

The literal meaning of the term "Honduras" is "depths" in Spanish. The name could either refer to the bay of Trujillo as an anchorage, ''fondura'' in the [[Leonese dialect]] of Spanish, or to [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s alleged quote that ''"Gracias a Dios que hemos salido de esas Honduras"'' ("Thank God we have departed from those depths").<ref name=timeline>{{cite web

Hondurans are often referred to as ''[[Catracho]]'' or ''Catracha'' (fem) in Spanish. The word was coined by [[Nicaraguans]] and derives from the last name of the Spanish Honduran General [[Florencio Xatruch]], who in 1857 led Honduran armed forces against an attempted invasion by North American adventurer [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. The nickname is considered complimentary, not derogatory.

In pre-Columbian times, modern Honduras was part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural area. In the west, Mayan civilization flourished for hundreds of years. The dominant state within Honduras' borders was in [[Copán]]. Copán fell with the other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the [[Classic Maya collapse|Terminal Classic]] in the 9th century. The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']], isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.<ref>

=== Spanish conquest (1524–1539) ===
{{main|Spanish conquest of Honduras}}
[[File:Cortes-Hernan-LOC.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Hernán Cortés]], one of the conquerors of Honduras]]
On his fourth and the final voyage to the [[New World]] in 1502, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed near the modern town of [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], near Guaimoreto Lagoon, becoming the first European to visit the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] on the coast of Honduras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://honduras.com/history/ |title=Columbus and the History of Honduras |publisher=Office of the Honduras National Chamber of Tourism |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> On 30 July 1502, Columbus sent his brother [[Bartholomew Columbus|Bartholomew]] to explore the islands and Bartholomew encountered a Mayan trading vessel from Yucatán, carrying well-dressed Maya and a rich cargo.{{sfnm|1a1=Perramon|1y=1986|1p=242|2a1=Clendinnen|2y=2003|2pp=3–4}} Bartholomew's men stole the cargo they wanted and kidnapped the ship's elderly captain to serve as an interpreter{{sfn|Clendinnen|2003|pp=3–4}} in the first recorded encounter between the Spanish and the Maya.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=758}}

Much of the conquest took place in the following two decades, first by groups loyal to [[Cristóbal de Olid]], and then by those loyal to [[Francisco de Montejo]] but most particularly by those following Alvarado.{{who|date=December 2017}} In addition to Spanish resources, the conquerors relied heavily on armed forces from Mexico—[[Tlaxcalans]] and [[Aztec|Mexica]] armies of thousands who remained garrisoned in the region.

Resistance to conquest was led in particular by [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]]. Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]]. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]]. Trujillo and [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias]] were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries.

===Spanish Honduras (1524–1821)===
Honduras was organized as a province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]] and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at [[Comayagua]], and finally at [[Tegucigalpa]] in the central part of the country.

Although the Spanish conquered the southern or Pacific portion of Honduras fairly quickly, they were less successful on the northern, or Atlantic side. They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at [[Puerto Cortés|Puerto Caballos]] and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]] in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of [[Jamaica]], which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.

[[File:Exterior Fuerte de Omoa Honduras.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa|Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa]] was built by the Spanish to protect the coast of Honduras from English pirates.]]

===Independence (1821)===
Honduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] until 1823, when it became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]]. It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842–1845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849–1852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.

[[Neoliberal]] policies favoring [[international trade]] and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital, [[Tegucigalpa]], ran out of money when it reached [[San Pedro Sula]]. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city. [[Comayagua]] was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa.

Since independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of régime.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===20th century and the role of American companies===
In the late nineteenth century, Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in [[Banana production in Honduras|banana plantations]] and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], as well as the [[United Fruit Company]], and [[Standard Fruit Company]], built an [[enclave economy]] in northern Honduras, controlling [[infrastructure]] and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth. American troops landed in Honduras in 1903, 1907, 1911, 1912, 1919, 1924 and 1925.<ref name=Becker>

Honduras joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Nations]] after [[attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], on 8 December 1941, and signed the [[Declaration by United Nations]] on 1 January 1942, along with twenty-five other governments.

Constitutional crises in the 1940s led to reforms in the 1950s. One reform gave workers permission to organize, and a 1954 [[General strike of 1954 (Honduras)|general strike]] paralyzed the northern part of the country for more than two months, but led to reforms. In 1963 a [[1963 Honduran coup d'état|military coup]] unseated democratically elected President [[Ramón Villeda Morales]].

===1969–1999 (Wars and corruption)===

In 1969, Honduras and [[El Salvador]] fought what became known as the [[Football War]]. Border tensions led to acrimony between the two countries after [[Oswaldo López Arellano]], the president of Honduras, blamed the deteriorating Honduran economy on immigrants from El Salvador. The relationship reached a low when El Salvador met Honduras for a three-round football elimination match preliminary to the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]].<ref name="FW">

In 1979, the country returned to civilian rule<!-- for the first time since 1963? -->. A [[constituent assembly]] was popularly elected in April 1980 to write a new constitution, and general elections were held in November 1981. The constitution was approved in 1982 and the [[Liberal Party of Honduras|PLH]] government of [[Roberto Suazo Córdova|Roberto Suazo]] won the election with a promise to carry out an ambitious program of economic and social development to tackle the recession in which Honduras found itself. He launched ambitious social and economic development projects sponsored by American development aid.

During the early 1980s, the United States established a continuing military presence in Honduras to support El Salvador, the [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contra]] guerrillas fighting the [[Nicaragua]]n government, and also develop an airstrip and modern port in Honduras. Though spared the bloody civil wars wracking its neighbors, the Honduran army quietly waged campaigns against [[Marxist–Leninist]] militias such as the [[People's Liberation Movement-Chinchoneros|Cinchoneros]] Popular Liberation Movement, notorious for kidnappings and bombings,<ref>

In 1998, [[Hurricane Mitch]] caused massive and widespread destruction. Honduran President [[Carlos Roberto Flores]] said that fifty years of progress in the country had been reversed. Mitch destroyed about 70% of the country's crops and an estimated 70–80% of the transportation infrastructure, including nearly all bridges and secondary roads. Across Honduras 33,000 houses were destroyed, and an additional 50,000 damaged. Some 5,000 people killed, and 12,000 more injured. Total losses were estimated at US$3 billion.<ref>

In 2007, President of Honduras [[Manuel Zelaya]] and President of the United States [[George W. Bush]] began talks on US assistance to Honduras to tackle the latter's growing drug cartels in Mosquito, Eastern Honduras using US Special Forces. This marked the beginning of a new foothold for the US Military's continued presence in Central America.<ref>{{cite news |title=Honduras Becomes U.S. Military Foothold for Central America |url=https://nacla.org/news/honduras-becomes-us-military-foothold-central-america |accessdate=13 November 2018 |publisher=NACLA |date=4 September 2007}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Honduras}}
[[File:Un-honduras.png|thumb|A map of Honduras.]]

The north coast of Honduras borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] and the Pacific Ocean lies south through the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. Honduras consists mainly of mountains, with narrow plains along the coasts.  A large undeveloped lowland jungle, ''[[La Mosquitia]]'' lies in the northeast, and the heavily populated lowland Sula valley in the northwest.  In La Mosquitia lies the [[UNESCO]] world-heritage site [[Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve]], with the [[Coco River]] which divides Honduras from [[Nicaragua]].

The [[Islas de la Bahía]] and the [[Swan Islands, Honduras|Swan Islands]] are off the north coast. [[Misteriosa Bank]] and [[Rosario Bank]], {{convert|130|to|150|km|abbr=off}} north of the Swan Islands, fall within the [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) of Honduras.
[[File:MontanasdelaSierradeAgalta Honduras.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Honduran rainforest.]]
Natural resources include timber, gold, silver, copper, lead, [[zinc]], iron ore, [[antimony]], coal, fish, shrimp, and [[hydropower]].

=== Climate ===
[[File:Honduras Köppen.svg|upright=1.15|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification system|Köppen climate types]] of Honduras]]
The climate varies from tropical in the [[lowland]]s to [[temperate]] in the mountains. The central and southern regions are relatively hotter and less humid than the northern coast.

===Ecology===
{{See also|List of birds of Honduras|Baja Aguán}}
The region is considered a [[biodiversity hotspot]] because of the many plant and animal species found there. Like other countries in the region, it contains vast biological resources. Honduras hosts more than 6,000 species of [[vascular plants]], of which 630 (described so far) are [[orchid]]s; around 250 [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s, more than 700 bird species, and 110 [[mammal]]ian species, of which half are [[bat]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hondurassilvestre.com |title=Honduran Biodiversity Database |publisher=Honduras Silvestre |accessdate=27 June 2010 |date=1 August 2012 |language=Spanish}}</ref>

In the northeastern region of [[La Mosquitia]] lies the [[Río Plátano Biosphere Reserve]], a lowland rainforest which is home to a great diversity of life. The reserve was added to the [[UNESCO World Heritage]] Sites List in 1982.

Honduras has rain forests, [[cloud forests]] (which can rise up to nearly {{convert|3,000|m|disp=or|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]), [[mangroves]], [[savannas]] and mountain ranges with pine and oak trees, and the [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]]. In the [[Bay Islands (department)|Bay Islands]] there are [[bottlenose dolphins]], [[manta rays]], [[parrot fish]], schools of [[Acanthurus coeruleus|blue tang]] and [[whale shark]].

=== Environmental issues ===
[[Deforestation]] resulting from [[logging]] is rampant in [[Olancho Department]]. The clearing of land for agriculture is prevalent in the largely undeveloped [[La Mosquitia]] region, causing [[land degradation]] and [[soil erosion]].

[[Lake Yojoa]], which is Honduras' largest source of fresh water, is polluted by [[heavy metals]] produced from [[mining]] activities.<ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Honduras}}

Honduras is governed within a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]]. The [[President of Honduras]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[Government of Honduras|Honduran government]]. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the [[National Congress of Honduras]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of both the executive branch and the legislature.

The [[National Congress of Honduras]] (''Congreso Nacional'') has 128 members (''diputados''), elected for a four-year term by [[proportional representation]]. Congressional seats are assigned the parties' candidates on a [[Departments of Honduras|departmental basis]] in proportion to the number of votes each party receives.<ref name=cia>{{cite web|title=Honduras|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ho.html|work=[[The World Fact Book]]|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Political culture ===
[[File:Presidente Juan Orlando Hernández.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Incumbent President [[Juan Orlando Hernández]]]]
In 1963, a military coup removed the democratically elected president, [[Ramón Villeda Morales]]. A string of authoritarian [[military junta|military governments]] held power uninterrupted until 1981, when [[Roberto Suazo Córdova]]  was elected president.

The party system was dominated by the conservative [[National Party of Honduras]] (Partido Nacional de Honduras: PNH) and the liberal [[Liberal Party of Honduras]]  (Partido Liberal de Honduras: PLH) until the [[2009 Honduran coup d'état]] removed [[Manuel Zelaya]] from office and put [[Roberto Micheletti]] in his place.

In late 2012, 1540 persons were interviewed by [[Radio Progreso & ERIC-SJ|ERIC]] in collaboration with the Jesuit [[Central American University "José Simeón Cañas"|university]], as reported by [[Associated Press]]. This survey found that 60.3% believed the police were involved in crime, 44.9% had "no confidence" in the Supreme Court, and 72% thought there was electoral fraud in the primary elections of November 2012. Also, 56% expected the presidential, legislative and municipal elections of 2013 to be fraudulent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/honduras-sondeo-muestra-pesimismo-y-desconfianza-192021621.html|title=Honduras: sondeo muestra pesimismo y desconfianza|last=Arce|first=Alberto|date=January 22, 2013|website=|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>

=== Foreign relations ===
{{Further|Foreign relations of Honduras}}

Honduras and [[Nicaragua]] had tense relations throughout 2000 and early 2001 due to a boundary dispute off the Atlantic coast. Nicaragua imposed a 35% [[tariff]] against Honduran goods due to the dispute.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In June 2009 a [[coup d'état]] ousted President [[Manuel Zelaya]]; he was taken in a military aircraft to neighboring [[Costa Rica]]. The General Assembly of the United Nations voted to denounce the coup and called for the restoration of Zelaya. Several [[Latin America]]n nations, including Mexico, temporarily severed diplomatic relations with Honduras. In July 2010, full diplomatic relations were once again re-established with Mexico.<ref>{{cite web

This interest in regional agreements may have increased the alarm of establishment politicians. When Zelaya began calling for a "fourth ballot box" to determine whether Hondurans wished to convoke a special constitutional congress, this sounded a lot to some like the constitutional amendments that had extended the terms of both [[Hugo Chavez]] and [[Evo Morales]]. "Chavez has served as a role model for like-minded leaders intent on cementing their power.

Because much of the Honduran economy is based on small scale agriculture of only a few exports, natural disasters have a particularly devastating impact. Natural disasters, such as [[Hurricane Mitch|1998 Hurricane Mitch]], have contributed to this inequality as they particularly affect poor rural areas.<ref name="worldbank.org">{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/honduras/overview|title=Overview|work=World Bank|access-date=2017-11-26|language=en}}</ref> Additionally, they are a large contributor to food insecurity in the country as farmers are left unable to provide for their families.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> A study done by Honduras NGO, World Neighbors, determined the terms "increased workload, decreased basic grains, expensive food, and fear" were most associated with Hurricane Mitch.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=24781641|title=GENDER, ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT IN HONDURAS: AN APPLIED ANTHROPOLOGY INTERNSHIP|first=Kathryn|last=Schaffer|date=18 January 2018|journal=Practicing Anthropology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=25–26}}</ref>

The rural and urban poor were hit hardest by Hurricane Mitch.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> Those in southern and western regions specifically were considered most vulnerable as they both were subject to environmental destruction and home to many subsistence farmers.<ref name="worldbank.org" />  Due to disasters such as Hurricane Mitch, the agricultural economic sector has declined a third in the past twenty years.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> This is mostly due to a decline in exports, such as bananas and coffee, that were affected by factors such as natural disasters.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> Indigenous communities along the Patuca River were hit extremely hard as well.<ref name=":9">McSweeney, Kendra, et al. "Climate-Related Disaster Opens a Window of Opportunity for Rural Poor in Northeastern Honduras." ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', vol. 108, no. 13, 2011, pp. 5203–5208. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/41125677.</ref> The mid-Pataca region was almost completely destroyed.<ref name=":9" /> Over 80% of rice harvest and all of banana, plantain, and manioc harvests were lost.<ref name=":9" />  Relief and reconstruction efforts following the storm were partial and incomplete, reinforcing existing levels of poverty rather than reversing those levels, especially for indigenous communities.<ref name=":9" />  The period between the end of food donations and the following harvest led to extreme hunger, causing deaths amongst the Tawahka population.<ref name=":9" />  Those that were considered the most "land-rich" lost 36% of their total land on average.<ref name=":9" />  Those that were the most "land-poor", lost less total land but a greater share of their overall total.<ref name=":9" />  This meant that those hit hardest were single women as they constitute the majority of this population.<ref name=":9" />

=== Poverty reduction strategies ===
Since the 1970s when Honduras was designated a "food priority country" by the UN, organizations such as The World Food Program (WFP) have worked to decrease malnutrition and food insecurity.<ref name="www1.wfp.org">{{Cite web|url=http://www1.wfp.org/countries/honduras|title=Honduras {{!}} World Food Programme|website=www1.wfp.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref>  A large majority of Honduran farmers live in [[extreme poverty]], or below 180 US dollars per capita.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rural Poverty in Latin America|last=López|first=Ramón|last2=Romano|first2=Claudia|date=2000|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan, London|isbn=9781349419548|pages=227–243|language=en|doi=10.1057/9780333977798_11}}</ref> Currently one fourth of children are affected by chronic malnutrition.<ref name="www1.wfp.org" /> WFP is currently working with the Honduran government on a School Feeding Program which provides meals for 21,000 Honduran schools, reaching 1.4 million school children.<ref name="www1.wfp.org" /> WFP also participates in disaster relief through reparations and emergency response in order to aid in quick recovery that tackles the effects of natural disasters on agricultural production.<ref name="www1.wfp.org" />

Honduras' [[Poverty Reduction Strategy in Honduras|Poverty Reduction Strategy]] was implemented in 1999 and aimed to cut [[extreme poverty]] in half by 2015.<ref name="econstor.eu">Klasen, Stephan; Otter, Thomas; Villalobos, Carlos (2012): The dynamics of inequality change in a highly dualistic economy: Honduras, 1991–2007, Discussion papers, Ibero America Institute for Economic Research, No. 215</ref> While spending on poverty-reduction aid  increased there was only a 2.5% increase in GDP between 1999 and 2002.<ref name=":10">Cuesta, Jose. "Political Space, Pro-Poor Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy in Honduras: A Story of Missed Opportunities". ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', vol. 39, no. 2, 2007, pp. 329–354. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4491813.</ref> This improvement left Honduras still below that of countries that lacked aid through Poverty Reduction Strategy behind those without it.<ref name=":10" />  The World Bank believes that this inefficiency stems from a lack of focus on infrastructure and rural development.<ref name=":10" />  [[Extreme poverty]] saw a low of 36.2 percent only two years after the implementation of the strategy but then increased to 66.5 percent by 2012.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org">Johnston, Jake, and Stephan Lefebvre. "Honduras Since the Coup: Economic and Social Outcomes". ''Center for Economic and Policy Research'', November 2013.</ref>

Poverty Reduction Strategies were also intended to affect social policy through increased investment in education and health sectors.<ref name=":11">RUCKERT, ARNE. "The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of Honduras and the Transformations of Neoliberalism". ''Canadian Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Studies / Revue Canadienne Des Études Latino-Américaines Et Caraïbes'', vol. 35, no. 70, 2010, pp. 113–139. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/41800522.</ref> This was expected to lift poor communities out of poverty while also increasing the workforce as a means of stimulating the Honduran economy.<ref name=":11" />  Conditional cash transfers were used to do this by the Family Assistance Program.<ref name=":11" />  This program was restructured in 1998 in an attempt to increase effectiveness of cash transfers for health and education specifically for those in extreme poverty.<ref name=":11" /> Overall spending within Poverty Reduction Strategies have been focused on education and health sectors increasing social spending from 44% of Honduras' GDP in 2000 to 51% in 2004.<ref name=":11" />

Critics of aid from International Finance Institutions believe that the World Bank's Poverty Reduction Strategy result in little substantive change to Honduran policy.<ref name=":11" /> Poverty Reduction Strategies also excluded clear priorities, specific intervention strategy, strong commitment to the strategy and more effective macro-level economic reforms according to Jose Cuesta of Cambridge University.<ref name=":10" /> Due to this he believes that the strategy did not provide a pathway for economic development that could lift Honduras out of poverty resulting in neither lasting economic growth of poverty reduction.<ref name=":10" />

Prior to its 2009 [[2009 Honduran coup d'état|coup]] Honduras widely expanded social spending and an extreme increase in minimum wage.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> Efforts to decrease inequality were swiftly reversed following the coup.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> When Zelaya was removed from office social spending as a percent of GDP decreased from 13.3 percent in 2009 to 10.9 recent in 2012.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" /> This decrease in social spending exacerbated the effects of the recession, which the nation was previously relatively well equipped to deal with.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org" />

The [[World Bank Group|World Bank]] Group Executive Board approved a plan known as the new Country Partnership Framework (CPF).<ref name="worldbank.org" /> This plan's objectives are to expand social program coverage, strengthen infrastructure, increase financing accessibility, strengthen regulatory framework and institutional capacity, improve the productivity of rural areas, strengthen natural disaster and climate change resiliency, and the buildup local governments so that violence and crime rates will decrease.<ref name=":0" /> The overall aim of the initiative is to decrease inequality and vulnerability of certain populations while increasing economic growth.<ref name="worldbank.org" /> Additionally the signing of the U.S.–Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) was meant to diversify the economy in order to promote growth and expand the range of exports the country is reliant on.<ref name="econstor.eu" />

===Economic inequality===
Levels of income inequality in Honduras are higher than in any other Latin American country.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org"/> Unlike other Latin American countries, inequality steadily increased in Honduras between 1991 and 2005.<ref name="econstor.eu"/> Between 2006 and 2010 inequality saw a decrease but increased again in 2010.<ref name="elcorreo.eu.org"/>

When Honduras' [[Human Development Index]] is adjusted for inequality (known as the IHDI) Honduras' development index is reduced to .443.<ref name=":1" /> The levels of inequality in each aspect of development can also be assessed.<ref name=":1" /> In 2015 inequality of life expectancy at birth was 19.6%, inequality in education was 24.4% and inequality in income was 41.5% <ref name=":1" /> The overall loss in human development due to inequality was 29.2.<ref name=":1" />

The IHDI for Latin America and the Caribbean overall is 0.575 with an overall loss of 23.4%.<ref name=":1" /> In 2015 for the entire region, inequality of life expectancy at birth was 22.9%, inequality in education was 14.0% and inequality in income was 34.9%.<ref name=":1" /> While Honduras has a higher life expectancy than other countries in the region (before and after inequality adjustments), its quality of education and economic standard of living are lower.<ref name=":1" />  Income inequality and education inequality have a large impact on the overall development of the nation.<ref name=":1" />

Inequality also exists between rural and urban areas as it relates to the distribution of resources.<ref>DeWalt, Billie R, et al. "Read 'Population and Land Use in Developing Countries: Report of a Workshop' at NAP.edu." ''National Academies Press: OpenBook'', National Research Council, www.nap.edu/read/2211/chapter/9.</ref> Poverty is concentrated in southern, eastern, and western regions where rural and indigenous peoples live. North and central Honduras are home to the country's industries and infrastructure, resulting in low levels of poverty.<ref name=":2" /> Poverty is concentrated in rural Honduras, a pattern that is reflected throughout Latin America.<ref name="cia.gov">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ho.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}</ref> The effects of poverty on rural communities are vast. Poor communities typically live in adobe homes, lack material resources, have limited access to medical resources, and live off of basics such as rice, maize and beans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.proyectomirador.org/poverty-and-crime/one-poorest-most-vulnerable-countries-world|title=One of the poorest, most vulnerable countries in the world – Proyecto Mirador|website=www.proyectomirador.org}}</ref>

The lower class predominantly consists of rural subsistence farmers and landless peasants.<ref name=":3">Merrill, Tim. ed. ''Honduras: A Country Study''. Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress, 1995.
</ref> Since 1965 there has been an increase in the number of landless peasants in Honduras which has led to a growing class of urban poor individuals.<ref name=":3" /> These individuals often migrate to urban centers in search of work in the service sector, manufacturing, or construction.<ref name=":3" /> Demographers believe that without social and economic reform, rural to urban migration will increase, resulting in the expansion of urban centers.<ref name=":3" /> Within the lower class, underemployment is a major issue.<ref name=":3" /> Individuals that are underemployed often only work as part-time laborers on seasonal farms meaning their annual income remains low.<ref name=":3" /> In the 1980s peasant organizations and labor unions such as the National Federation of Honduran Peasants, The National Association of Honduran Peasants and the National Union of Peasants formed.<ref name=":3" />

It is not uncommon for rural individuals to voluntarily enlist in the military, however this often does not offer stable or promising career opportunities.<ref name=":8">Cameron, Samuel, et al. "It Could Be You! Military Conscription and Selection Bias in Rural Honduras." ''Revista Europea De Estudios Latinoamericanos y Del Caribe / European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies'', no. 68, 2000, pp. 47–63. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/25675865.</ref> The majority of high-ranking officials in the Honduran army are recruited from elite military academies.<ref name=":8" /> Additionally, the majority of enlistment in the military is forced.<ref name=":8" />  Forced recruitment largely relies on an alliance between the Honduran government, military and upper class Honduran society.<ref name=":8" /> In urban areas males are often sought out from secondary schools while in rural areas roadblocks aided the military in handpicking recruits.<ref name=":8" /> Higher socio-economic status enables individuals to more easily evade the draft.<ref name=":8" />

Middle class Honduras is a small group defines by relatively low membership and income levels.<ref name=":3" /> Movement from lower to middle class is typically facilitated by higher education.<ref name=":3" /> Professionals, students, farmers, merchants, business employees, and civil servants are all considered a part of the Honduran middle class.<ref name=":3" /> Opportunities for employment and the industrial and commercial sectors are slow growing, limiting middle class membership.<ref name=":3" />

The Honduran upper class has much higher income levels than the rest of the Honduran population reflecting large amounts of income inequality.<ref name=":3" /> Much of the upper class affords their success to the growth of cotton and livestock exports post-[[World War II]].<ref name=":3" /> The wealthy are not politically unified and differ in political and economic views.<ref name=":3" />

=== Trade ===
The currency is the [[Honduran lempira]].

The government operates both the electrical grid, [[Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica]] (ENEE) and the land-line telephone service, [[Hondutel]]. ENEE receives heavy [[subsidies]] to counter its chronic financial problems, but Hondutel is no longer a [[monopoly]]. The telecommunication sector was opened to private investment on 25 December 2005, as required under [[CAFTA]]. The price of petroleum is regulated, and the [[National Congress of Honduras|Congress]] often ratifies temporary [[price]] regulation for basic [[commodities]].

In 2006 the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] announced the first phase of the [[Secure Freight Initiative]] (SFI), which built upon existing port security measures. SFI gave the U.S. government enhanced authority, allowing it to scan containers from overseas{{clarify|date=June 2016}} for nuclear and radiological materials in order to improve the risk assessment of individual US-bound containers. The initial phase of Secure Freight involved deploying of nuclear detection and other devices to six foreign ports:
* [[Port Qasim]] in Pakistan;
* [[Puerto Cortés]] in Honduras;
* [[Southampton]] in the United Kingdom;
* [[Port of Salalah]] in [[Oman]];
* [[Port of Singapore]];
* Gamman Terminal at [[Port of Busan|Port Busan]], Korea.

Containers in these ports have been scanned since 2007 for radiation and other risk factors before they are allowed to depart for the United States.<ref>

===Energy===
{{Further|Electricity sector in Honduras}}

About half of the electricity sector in Honduras is privately owned. The remaining [[electricity generation|generation]] capacity is run by [[ENEE]] (''Empresa Nacional de Energía Eléctrica'').
Key challenges in the sector are:
* Financing investments in generation and transmission without either a financially healthy utility or concessionary funds from external donors
* Re-balancing [[tariff]]s, cutting [[arrears]] and reducing losses, including electricity theft, without social unrest
* Reconciling environmental concerns with government objectives – two large new dams and associated hydropower plants.
* Improving access to electricity in rural areas.

===Transportation===
[[File:Carretera37.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A highway in Honduras]]
Infrastructure for [[transportation in Honduras]] consists of: {{convert|699|km|abbr=off}} [[Rail transport in Honduras|of railways]];  {{convert|13,603|km|abbr=off}} of roadways;<ref name=cia/> seven ports and harbors;{{Citation needed|date=February 2018|reason=Citation needed}} and 112 airports altogether (12 Paved, 100 unpaved).<ref name=cia/> The Ministry of Public Works, Transport and Housing (SOPRTRAVI in Spanish acronym) is responsible for transport sector policy.

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Honduras}}

[[Water supply and sanitation in Honduras]] differ greatly from urban centers to rural villages. Larger population centers generally have modernized water treatment and distribution systems, but water quality is often poor because of lack of proper maintenance and treatment. Rural areas generally have basic drinking water systems with limited capacity for water treatment. Many urban areas have sewer systems in place to collect wastewater, but proper treatment of wastewater is rare. In rural areas sanitary facilities are generally limited to latrines and basic septic pits.

Water and sanitation services were historically provided by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Servicio Autónomo de Alcantarillas y Aqueductos|es}} (SANAA). In 2003, the government enacted a new "water law" which called for the [[decentralization]] of water services. Under the 2003 law, local communities have both the right and the responsibility to own, operate, and control their own drinking water and wastewater systems. Since this law passed, many communities have joined together to address water and sanitation issues on a regional basis.

Many national and international non-government organizations have a history of working on water and sanitation projects in Honduras. International groups include the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]], [[Water 1st International|Water 1st]], [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]], [[Catholic Relief Services]], Water for People, [[EcoLogic Development Fund]], [[CARE (relief)|CARE]], the [[Canadian Executive Service Organization]] (CESO-SACO), [[Engineers Without Borders – USA]], Flood The Nations, [[Students Helping Honduras]] (SHH), [[Global Brigades]], and Agua para el Pueblo<ref>{{cite web

In addition, many government organizations work on projects in Honduras, including the [[European Union]], the [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]], Cooperacion Andalucia, the [[government of Japan]], and others.

==Demographics==

Honduras had a population of {{UN_Population|Honduras}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}.{{UN_Population|ref}} The proportion of the population below the age of 15 in 2010 was 36.8%, 58.9% were between 15 and 65 years old, and 4.3% were 65 years old or older.<ref name="WPP 2012">{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm |publisher=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] |title=World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision |year=2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506065230/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/index.htm |archivedate=6 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Since 1975, emigration from Honduras has accelerated as economic migrants and political refugees sought a better life elsewhere. A majority of [[Honduran diaspora|expatriate Hondurans]] live in the United States. A 2012 US State Department estimate suggested that between 800,000 and one million Hondurans lived in the United States at that time, nearly 15% of the Honduran population.<ref name="DOS-Honduras"/> The large uncertainty about numbers is because numerous Hondurans live in the United States without a visa. In the 2010 census in the United States, 617,392 residents identified as Hondurans, up from 217,569 in 2000.<ref>

===Race and ethnicity===
The ethnic breakdown of Honduran society was 90% [[Mestizo]], 7% American Indian, 2% Black and 1% White (2017).<ref name="cia.gov"/> The 1927 Honduran census provides no racial data but in 1930 five classifications were created: white, Indian, Negro, yellow, and mestizo.<ref name=":4">Vandiver, Marylee Mason. "Racial Classifications in Latin American Censuses." ''Social Forces'', vol. 28, no. 2, 1949, pp. 138–146. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2572639.</ref> This system was used in the 1935 and 1940 census.<ref name=":4" /> Mestizo was used to describe individuals that did not fit neatly into the categories of white, Indian, negro or yellow or who are of mixed white-Indian descent.<ref name=":4" />

John Gillin considers Honduras to be one of thirteen "Mestizo countries" (Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay).<ref name=":5">GILLIN, John. "Problems of Mestizo America : A Sociological Approach / LE POINT DE VUE DU SOCIOLOGUE : L'AMERIQUE METISSE." ''Civilisations'', vol. 5, no. 4, 1955, pp. 509–521.

===Languages===
[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official, national language. In addition to Spanish, a number of indigenous languages are spoken, as well as Honduran sign language and [[Bay Islands Creole English]].<ref name=Ethnologue>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/sites/default/files/Ethnologue-17-Honduras.pdf|title=Ethnologue: Languages of Honduras, Seventeenth edition data M. Paul Lewis, Gary F. Simons, and Charles D. Fennig, Editors|publisher=}}</ref>

The main indigenous languages are:
* [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]] ([[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]]) (almost 100,000 speakers in Honduras including monolinguals)
* [[Mískito language|Mískito]] ([[Misumalpan languages|Misumalpan]]) (29,000 speakers in Honduras)
* [[Sumu language|Mayangna]] ([[Misumalpan languages|Misumalpan]]) (less than 1000 speakers in Honduras, more in [[Nicaragua]])
* [[Pech language|Pech/Paya]], ([[Chibchan languages|Chibchan]]) (less than 1000 speakers)
* [[Jicaque language|Tol]] (isolate) (less than 500 speakers)
* [[Ch'orti' language|Ch'orti']] ([[Mayan languages|Mayan]]) (less than 50 speakers)

The [[Lenca language|Lenca]] isolate lost all its fluent native speakers in the 20th century but is currently undergoing revival efforts among the members of the ethnic population of about 100,000. The largest immigrant languages are Arabic (42,000), Armenian (1,300), Turkish (900), Yue Chinese (1,000).<ref name=Ethnologue/>

[[File:OscarKardinalRodriguez.jpg|thumb|upright|Cardinal [[Óscar Andrés Rodríguez]] is [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Tegucigalpa|Archbishop of Tegucigalpa]] and a figure of national and international note]]
Although most Hondurans are nominally [[Roman Catholic]] (which would be considered the main religion), membership in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] is declining while membership in Protestant churches is increasing. The International Religious Freedom Report, 2008, notes that a CID Gallup poll reported that 51.4% of the population identified themselves as [[Catholic]], 36.2% as [[evangelical]] [[Protestant]], 1.3% claiming to be from other religions, including [[Muslims]], [[Buddhists]], [[Jews]], [[Rastafarians]], etc. and 11.1% do not belong to any religion or unresponsive. 8% reported as being either atheistic or agnostic. Customary Catholic church tallies and membership estimates 81% Catholic where the priest (in more than 185 parishes) is required to fill out a pastoral account of the parish each year.<ref>{{cite book|title=Annuario Pontificio|year=2009|isbn=978-88209-81914|publisher=[[Cardinal Secretary of State]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Catholic Almanac|first1=Matthew E.|last1=Bunson|first2=D.|last2=Min|location=Huntington, Ind.|publisher=Sunday Visitor Publishing|date=4 November 2015|isbn=978-1612789446|pages=312–13}}</ref>

Most pollsters suggest an annual poll taken over a number of years would provide the best method of knowing religious demographics and variations in any single country. Still, in Honduras are thriving [[Anglican]], [[Presbyterian]], [[Methodist]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]], [[Lutheran]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]] ([[Mormonism|Mormon]]) and [[Pentecostal]] churches. There are Protestant seminaries. The Catholic Church, still the only "church" that is recognized, is also thriving in the number of schools, hospitals, and pastoral institutions (including its own medical school) that it operates. Its [[archbishop]], [[Óscar Rodríguez Maradiaga|Óscar Andrés Rodriguez Maradiaga]], is also very popular, both with the government, other churches, and in his own church. Practitioners of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], Jewish, Islamic, [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] and indigenous denominations and religions exist.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108530.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2008: Honduras |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=19 September 2008 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Crime ===
{{Main|Crime in Honduras}}

Owing to insufficient law enforcement resources, crime in Honduras is rampant and criminals operate with a high degree of impunity.  Consequently, Honduras has one of the highest murder rates in the world.  Official statistics from the Honduran Observatory on National Violence show Honduras' homicide rate was 60 per 100,000 in 2015 with the majority of homicide cases unprosecuted.<ref name="Travel Warnings">{{cite web|title=Honduras Travel Warning|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/honduras-travel-warning.html|website=Travel.State.Gov|publisher=U.S. State Department|accessdate=17 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817232455/https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/en/alertswarnings/honduras-travel-warning.html|archivedate=17 August 2016}}</ref>

Highway assaults and carjackings at roadblocks or checkpoints set up by criminals with police uniforms and equipment occur frequently. Although reports of kidnappings of foreigners are not common, families of kidnapping victims often pay ransoms without reporting the crime to police out of fear of retribution, so kidnapping figures may be underreported.<ref name="Travel Warnings"/>

Owing to measures taken by government and business in 2014 to improve tourist safety, Roatan and the Bay Islands have lower crime rates than the Honduran mainland.<ref name="Travel Warnings"/>

In the less populated region of Gracias a Dios, narcotics-trafficking is rampant and police presence is scarce.  Threats against U.S. citizens by drug traffickers and other criminal organizations have resulted in the U.S. Embassy placing restrictions on the travel of U.S. officials through the region.<ref name="Travel Warnings"/>

=== Cuisine ===
{{Further|Honduran cuisine}}

[[File:SopadeOlla.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|"Olla" Soup, made with beef broth, squash, yucca and common Central American vegetables]]
Honduran cuisine is a fusion of indigenous [[Lenca]] cuisine, [[Cuisine of Spain|Spanish cuisine]], [[Caribbean cuisine]] and [[African cuisine]]. There are also dishes from the [[Garifuna people]]. [[Coconut]] and coconut milk are featured in both sweet and savory dishes. Regional specialties include fried [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[tamale]]s, [[carne asada]] and [[baleada]]s.

Other popular dishes include: meat roasted with [[chismol]] and [[carne asada]], chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and jalapeños.  Some of the ways seafood and some meats are prepared in coastal areas and in the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] involve [[coconut]] milk.

The soups Hondurans enjoy include [[bean]] soup, mondongo soup [[tripe]] soup, [[seafood]] soups and [[beef]] soups. Generally these soups are served mixed with [[plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[cassava|yuca]], and cabbage, and served with [[Maize|corn]] [[tortilla]]s.

Other typical dishes are the montucas or corn [[tamale]]s, stuffed tortillas, and tamales wrapped in [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] leaves. Honduran typical dishes also include an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as [[papaya]], [[pineapple]], [[plum]], [[sapote]], [[passion fruit]] and bananas which are prepared in many ways while they are still green.

=== Media ===
{{Further|Media of Honduras}}
At least half of Honduran households have at least one television. Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries. Honduras' main newspapers are [[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]], [[El Heraldo (Tegucigalpa)|El Heraldo]], [[La Tribuna]] and Diario Tiempo. The official newspaper is {{Interlanguage link multi|La Gaceta (Honduras)|es|3=La Gaceta}}.

=== Music ===
{{Further|Music of Honduras}}

[[Punta]] is the main music of Honduras, with other sounds such as Caribbean salsa, [[merengue music|merengue]], reggae, and [[reggaeton]] all widely heard, especially in the north, and Mexican [[ranchera]]s heard in the rural interior of the country.

===Celebrations===
{{Further|Public holidays in Honduras}}

[[File:Saw dust carpet Comayagua Honduras (1).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sawdust carpet]]s of [[Comayagua]] during [[Easter]] celebrations]]
Some of Honduras' national holidays include Honduras Independence Day on 15 September and Children's Day or Día del Niño, which is celebrated in homes, schools and churches on 10 September; on this day, children receive presents and have parties similar to Christmas or birthday celebrations. Some neighborhoods have piñatas on the street. Other holidays are Easter, [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], Day of the Soldier (3 October to celebrate the birth of [[Francisco Morazán]]), Christmas, El Dia de [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] on 20 July,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marrder.com/htw/jun99/cultural.htm |title=Honduras This Week Online June 1999 |publisher=Marrder.com |date=9 December 1991 |accessdate=27 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117130102/http://www.marrder.com/htw/jun99/cultural.htm |archivedate=17 January 2011}}</ref> and New Year's Eve.

Honduras Independence Day festivities start early in the morning with marching bands. Each band wears different colors and features cheerleaders. Fiesta Catracha takes place this same day: typical Honduran foods such as [[bean]]s, [[tamale]]s, baleadas, [[cassava]] with [[chicharrón]], and [[tortilla]]s are offered.

On Christmas Eve people reunite with their families and close friends to have dinner, then give out presents at midnight. In some cities fireworks are seen and heard at midnight. On New Year's Eve there is food and "cohetes", fireworks and festivities. Birthdays are also great events, and include piñatas filled with candies and surprises for the children.

[[La Ceiba Carnival]] is celebrated in [[La Ceiba]], a city located in the north coast, in the second half of May to celebrate the day of the city's patron saint [[Saint Isidore]]. People from all over the world come for one week of festivities. Every night there is a little carnaval (carnavalito) in a neighborhood. On Saturday there is a big parade with floats and displays with people from many countries. This celebration is also accompanied by the Milk Fair, where many Hondurans come to show off their farm products and animals.

===National symbols===
[[File:Ara macao - two at Lowry Park Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The national bird, ''[[Ara macao]]'']]
The [[flag of Honduras]] is composed of three equal horizontal stripes. The blue upper and lower stripes represent the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The central stripe is white. It contains five blue stars representing the five states of the [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American Union]]. The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.

The coat of arms was established in 1945. It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining. The triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: "Republic of Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent".

The "[[National Anthem of Honduras]]" is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of [[Manuel Bonilla]]. In the end, it was the poet [[Augusto Coello]] that ended up writing the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer [[Carlos Hartling]] writing the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during the presidency of {{Interlanguage link multi|Alberto de Jesús Membreño|es|3=Alberto Membreño}}. The anthem is composed of a choir and seven stroonduran.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}

The national flower is the famous orchid, ''[[Rhyncholaelia]] digbyana'' (formerly known as ''Brassavola digbyana''), which replaced the rose in 1969. The change of the national flower was carried out during the administration of general [[Oswaldo López Arellano]], thinking that ''Brassavola digbyana'' "is an indigenous plant of Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor and distinction", as the decree dictates it.

The national tree of Honduras was declared in 1928 to be simply "the Pine that appears symbolically in our [[Coat of Arms]]" (''el Pino que figura simbólicamente en nuestro Escudo''),<ref>Acuerdo No. 429, 14 de mayo de 1928.</ref> even though [[pine]]s comprise a [[genus]] and not a [[species]], and even though legally there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the coat of arms ''either''. Because of its commonality in the country, the ''[[Pinus oocarpa]]'' species has become since then the species most strongly associated as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated as the national tree is the ''[[Pinus caribaea]]''.

The national mammal is the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), which was adopted as a measure to avoid excessive depredation.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.
The national bird of Honduras is the [[scarlet macaw]] (''Ara macao''). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian civilizations of Honduras.

===Folklore===
Legends and fairy tales are paramount in Honduran culture. [[Lluvia de Peces]] (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. The legends of El [[Cadejo]] and [[La Llorona]] are also popular.

===Sports===
The major sports in Honduras are football, basketball, rugby, volleyball and cycling, with smaller followings for athletics, softball and handball. Information about some of the sports organisations in Honduras are listed below:

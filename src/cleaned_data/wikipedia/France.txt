In the 19th century, [[Napoleon]] took power and established the [[First French Empire]]. His subsequent [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–15) shaped the course of continental Europe. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the [[French Third Republic]] in 1870. France was a [[Triple Entente|major participant]] in [[World War I]], from which it [[Treaty of Versailles (1919)|emerged victorious]], and was one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[World War II]], but came under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|occupation]] by the [[Axis powers]] in 1940.

The concept of [[Gaul]] emerged at that time; it corresponds to the territories of Celtic settlement ranging between the [[Rhine]], the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the [[Pyrenees]] and the Mediterranean. The borders of modern France are roughly the same as those of ancient Gaul, which was inhabited by Celtic ''Gauls''. Gaul was then a prosperous country, of which the southernmost part was heavily subject to Greek and Roman cultural and economic influences.

Around 390 BC the Gallic [[Tribal chief|chieftain]] [[Brennus (4th century BC)|Brennus]] and his troops made their way to Italy through the [[Alps]], defeated the Romans in the [[Battle of the Allia]], and besieged and [[ransom]]ed [[Rome]].<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0080%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D91 Tacitus, The Histories, 2.91]</ref> The Gallic invasion left Rome weakened, and the Gauls continued to harass the region until 345 BC when they entered into a formal peace treaty with Rome.<ref>Polybius, The Histories, 2.18.19</ref> But the Romans and the Gauls would remain adversaries for the next centuries, and the Gauls would continue to be a threat in [[Italy (Roman Empire)|Italy]].<ref>Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome, p. 325</ref>

Around 125 BC, the south of Gaul was conquered by the Romans, who called this region ''[[Gallia Narbonensis|Provincia Nostra]]'' ("Our Province"), which over time evolved into the name [[Provence]] in French.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZEIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA77 |title=Provence in Stone |work=Life |page=77 |date=13 July 1953 |accessdate=23 January 2011}}</ref> [[Julius Caesar]] conquered the remainder of Gaul and overcame a revolt carried out by the Gallic chieftain [[Vercingetorix]] in 52 BC.<ref>Carpentier ''et al.'' 2000, pp. 44–45.</ref> According to [[Plutarch]] and the writings of scholar Brendan Woods, the [[Gallic Wars]] resulted in 800 conquered cities, 300 subdued tribes, one million men sold into [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slavery]], and another three million dead in battle.{{cn|date=February 2019}}

The [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman polytheism]] merged with the [[Celtic polytheism|Gallic paganism]] into the same [[syncretism]].

From the 250s to the 280s AD, Roman Gaul suffered a serious crisis with its [[limes|fortified borders]] being attacked on several occasions by [[barbarian]]s.<ref name=c77>Carpentier et al. 2000, pp. 76–77</ref> Nevertheless, the situation improved in the first half of the 4th century, which was a period of revival and prosperity for Roman Gaul.<ref>Carpentier ''et al.'' 2000, pp. 79–82.</ref> In 312, Emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantin I]] converted to Christianity.

[[File:Franks expansion.gif|thumb|alt=animated gif showing expansion of Franks across Europe|Frankish expansion from 481 to 843/870.]]
At the end of the [[Late Antiquity|Antiquity]] period, ancient Gaul was divided into several Germanic kingdoms and a remaining Gallo-Roman territory, known as the [[Domain of Soissons|Kingdom of Syagrius]]. Simultaneously, [[Britons (historical)|Celtic Britons]], fleeing the [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain]], settled the western part of [[Armorica]]. As a result, the Armorican [[peninsula]] was renamed [[Brittany]], [[Celts|Celtic culture]] was revived and independent [[petty kingdom]]s arose in this region.

The first leader to make himself king of all the Franks was [[Clovis I]], who began his reign in 481, routing the last forces of the Roman governors of the province in 486. Clovis claimed that he would be baptized a Christian in the event of his victory against the [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigoths]], which was said to have guaranteed the battle. Clovis [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|regained the southwest from the Visigoths]], was baptized in 508, and made himself master of what is now western Germany.

Clovis I was the first [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] conqueror after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to Catholic Christianity, rather than [[Arianism]]; thus France was given the title "Eldest daughter of the Church" (''{{lang-fr|La fille aînée de l'Église|links=no}}'') by the papacy,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html |title=Faith of the Eldest Daughter&nbsp;– Can France retain her Catholic heritage? |publisher=Wf-f.org |accessdate=17 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722112834/http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html |archivedate=22 July 2011}}</ref> and French kings would be called "the Most Christian Kings of France" (''{{lang|und|Rex Christianissimus}}'').

The Franks embraced the Christian [[Gallo-Roman culture]] and ancient Gaul was eventually renamed ''[[Francia]]'' ("Land of the Franks"). The Germanic Franks adopted [[Romance languages|Romanic languages]], except in northern Gaul where Roman settlements were less dense and where [[Germanic languages]] emerged. Clovis made Paris his capital and established the [[Merovingian dynasty]], but his kingdom would not survive his death. The Franks treated land purely as a private possession and divided it among their heirs, so four kingdoms emerged from Clovis's: Paris, [[Orléans]], [[Soissons]], and [[Reims|Rheims]]. The [[Roi fainéant|last Merovingian kings]] [[Power behind the throne|lost power]] to their [[Mayor of the Palace|mayors of the palace]] (head of household). One mayor of the palace, [[Charles Martel]], defeated an [[Islamic invasion of Gaul]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] (732) and earned respect and power within the Frankish kingdoms. His son, [[Pepin the Short]], seized the crown of Francia from the weakened Merovingians and founded the [[Carolingian dynasty]]. Pepin's son, [[Charlemagne]], reunited the Frankish kingdoms and built a vast empire across [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, continually threatened by [[Viking expansion|Viking invasions]], France became a very decentralised state: the nobility's titles and lands became hereditary, and the authority of the king became more religious than secular and thus was less effective and constantly challenged by powerful noblemen. Thus was established [[feudalism]] in France. Over time, some of the king's vassals would grow so powerful that they often posed a threat to the king. For example, after the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066, [[William the Conqueror]] added "King of England" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of [[Normandy]]) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France, creating recurring tensions.

Tensions between the kingdom of France and the [[Angevin Empire|Plantagenet empire]] would last a hundred years, until [[Philip Augustus]] of France conquered between 1202 and 1214 most of the continental possessions of the empire, leaving England and [[Aquitaine]] to the Plantagenets.

[[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], Louis XV's grandson, actively [[France in the American Revolutionary War|supported the Americans]], who were seeking their [[American Revolutionary War|independence from Great Britain]] (realised in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]]). The financial crisis aggravated by France's involvement in the American Revolutionary War was one of many contributing factors to the French Revolution. Much of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] occurred in French intellectual circles, and major scientific breakthroughs and inventions, such as the [[Antoine Lavoisier|discovery of oxygen]] (1778) and the first [[Montgolfier brothers|hot air balloon carrying passengers]] (1783), were achieved by French scientists.

=== Revolutionary France (1789–1799) ===
{{Main|History of France#Revolutionary France (1789–1799)|French Revolution}}
[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|alt=drawing of the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, smoke of gunfire enveloping stone castle|The [[Storming of the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789 was the most emblematic event of the [[French Revolution]].]]
Facing financial troubles, King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] summoned the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] (gathering the three [[Estates of the realm]]) in May 1789 to propose solutions to his government. As it came to an impasse, the representatives of the [[Commoner|Third Estate]] formed into a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], signalling the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]]. Fearing that the king would suppress the newly created National Assembly, insurgents [[Storming of the Bastille|stormed the Bastille]] on 14 July 1789, a date which would become [[Bastille Day|France's National Day]].

In early August 1789, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] [[August Decrees|abolished the privileges]] of the [[French nobility|nobility]] such as [[Serfdom|personal serfdom]] and exclusive hunting rights.
Through the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Man and of the Citizen of 1789|Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] (27 August 1789) France established fundamental rights for men. The Declaration affirms "the natural and imprescriptible rights of man" to "liberty, property, security and resistance to oppression". Freedom of speech and press were declared, and arbitrary arrests outlawed. It called for the destruction of aristocratic privileges and proclaimed freedom and equal rights for all men, as well as access to public office based on talent rather than birth.

In November 1789, the Assembly decided to nationalize and sell all property of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] which had been the largest landowner in the country. In July 1790, a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] reorganised the French Catholic Church, cancelling the authority of the Church to levy taxes, et cetera. This fueled much discontent in parts of France, which would contribute to the civil war breaking out some years later. While King Louis XVI still enjoyed popularity among the population, his disastrous [[flight to Varennes]] (June 1791) seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to the prospects of foreign invasion. His credibility was so deeply undermined that the [[Abolition of monarchy|abolition of the monarchy]] and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.

In August 1791, the Emperor of [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and the King of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] in the [[Declaration of Pillnitz]] threatened revolutionary France to intervene by force of arms to restore the French absolute monarchy. In September 1791, the National Constituent Assembly forced King Louis XVI to accept the [[French Constitution of 1791]], thus turning the French absolute monarchy into a [[Kingdom of France (1791–92)|constitutional monarchy]]. In the newly established [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislative Assembly]] (October 1791), enmity developed and deepened between a group, later called the '[[Girondins]]', who favored war with [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], and a group later called '[[The Mountain|Montagnards]]' or '[[Jacobin]]s', who opposed such a war. A majority in the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Assembly]] in 1792 however saw a war with Austria and Prussia as a chance to boost the popularity of the revolutionary government, and thought that France would win a war against those gathered monarchies. On 20 April 1792, therefore, they [[French Revolutionary Wars|declared war on Austria]].{{efn-ur|The present-day state of [[Austria]] did not exist as such, its territory was part of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] which also comprised the present-day states of [[Hungary]], [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1648–1867)|Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia#Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1918)|Slovakia]], [[Belgium]], [[Slovenia#The Middle Ages to the early modern period|Slovenia]] and [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]]: that Habsburg Monarchy was usually called 'Austria'.}}

Ex-King Louis XVI was [[Trial of Louis XVI|convicted]] of [[treason]] and [[Execution of Louis XVI|guillotined in January 1793]].
France had declared war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic in November 1792 and did the same on Spain in March 1793; in the spring of 1793, Austria and Prussia invaded France; in March, France created a "[[sister republic]]" in the "[[Republic of Mainz]]".

Also in March 1793, the [[War in the Vendée|civil war of the Vendée against Paris]] started, evoked by both the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] of 1790 and the nationwide army [[conscription]] early 1793; elsewhere in France rebellion was brewing too.
A factionalist feud in the National Convention, smoldering ever since October 1791, came to a climax with the group of the '[[Girondins]]' on 2 June 1793 being forced to resign and leave the Convention.
The counter-revolution, begun in March 1793 in the Vendée, by July had spread to [[Brittany (administrative region)|Brittany]], [[Normandy]], Bordeaux, Marseilles, Toulon, and Lyon. Paris' Convention government between October and December 1793 with brutal measures managed to subdue most internal uprisings, at the cost of tens of thousands of lives. Some historians consider the civil war to have lasted until 1796 with a toll of possibly 450,000 lives.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Terror in the French Revolution |first=Marisa |last=Dr Linton |url=http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload,20545,en.pdf |publisher=Kingston University |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117152123/http://www.port.ac.uk/special/france1815to2003/chapter1/interviews/filetodownload%2C20545%2Cen.pdf |archivedate=17 January 2012}}</ref><ref>Jacques Hussenet (dir.), ''" Détruisez la Vendée !

Political disagreements and enmity in the [[National Convention]] between October 1793 and July 1794 reached unprecedented levels, leading to dozens of Convention members being sentenced to death and guillotined.
Meanwhile, [[French Revolutionary Wars|France's external wars]] in 1794 were going prosperous, for example in Belgium.
In 1795, the government seemed to return to indifference towards the desires and needs of the lower classes concerning freedom of ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]]) religion and fair distribution of food.
Until 1799, politicians, apart from inventing a new parliamentary system (the '[[French Directory|Directory]]'), busied themselves with dissuading the people from [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] and from royalism.

[[Napoleon]] Bonaparte [[Coup of 18 Brumaire|seized control of the Republic]] in 1799 becoming [[French Consulate|First Consul]] and later [[Constitution of the Year XII|Emperor]] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1804–1814; 1815). As a continuation of [[French Revolutionary Wars|the wars]] sparked by the European monarchies against the French Republic, changing sets of [[Coalition Wars|European Coalitions]] declared wars on Napoleon's Empire. His armies conquered most of continental Europe with swift victories such as the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstadt|battles of Jena-Auerstadt]] or [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]]. Members of the [[House of Bonaparte|Bonaparte]] family were appointed as monarchs in some of the newly established kingdoms.<ref name="Blanning">{{cite news |title=Napoleon and German identity |first=Tim |last=Blanning |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001329960 |newspaper=History Today |location=London |date=April 1998 |volume=48}}</ref> These victories led to the worldwide expansion of French revolutionary ideals and reforms, such as the [[Metric system]], the [[Napoleonic Code]] and the Declaration of the Rights of Man. In June 1812, Napoleon attacked [[Russia]], reaching [[Moscow]]. Thereafter his army disintegrated through supply problems, disease, Russian attacks, and finally winter. After the catastrophic [[French invasion of Russia|Russian campaign]], and the ensuing [[War of the Sixth Coalition|uprising of European monarchies]] against his rule, Napoleon was defeated and the Bourbon monarchy [[Bourbon Restoration#First Restoration (1814)|restored]]. About a million Frenchmen died during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name="Blanning" /> After his [[Hundred Days|brief return]] from exile, Napoleon was finally defeated in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], the monarchy was [[Bourbon Restoration|re-established]] (1815–1830), with new constitutional limitations.

The discredited Bourbon dynasty was overthrown by the [[July Revolution]] of 1830, which established the constitutional [[July Monarchy]]. In that year, French troops conquered [[Algeria]], establishing the first colonial presence in Africa since Napoleon's abortive [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt]] in 1798. According to historian [[Ben Kiernan]], the French conquest and pacification of Algeria from 1830 until the early twentieth century slaughtered 825,000 Algerian people. French losses from 1831–51 were 92,329 dead in the hospital and only 3,336 killed in action.<ref>"Had planning been better (barracks, hospitals, medical services), the drain on men would have been miniscule: it has been calculated that between 1831 and 1851, 92,329 died in hospital, and only 3,336 in battle."

In 1848 general unrest led to the [[French Revolution of 1848|February Revolution]] and the end of the July Monarchy. The abolition of slavery and male [[universal suffrage]], both briefly enacted during the French Revolution were re-enacted in 1848. In 1852, the [[President of France|president of the French Republic]], [[Napoleon III|Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]], Napoleon I's nephew, was proclaimed emperor of the [[Second French Empire|second Empire]], as Napoleon III. He multiplied French interventions abroad, especially in [[Crimean War|Crimea]], in [[French intervention in Mexico|Mexico]] and [[Second Italian War of Independence|Italy]] which resulted in the annexation of the [[duchy of Savoy]] and the [[county of Nice]], then part of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. Napoleon III was unseated following defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 and his regime was replaced by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]].

France had [[French colonial empire|colonial possessions]], in various forms, since the beginning of the 17th century, but in the 19th and 20th centuries, its [[List of largest empires|global overseas colonial empire]] extended greatly and became the second largest in the world behind the [[British Empire]]. Including [[metropolitan France]], the total area of land under French [[sovereignty]] almost reached 13 million square kilometres in the 1920s and 1930s, 8.6% of the world's land. Known as the ''[[Belle Époque]]'', the turn of the century was a period characterised by optimism, regional peace, economic prosperity and technological, scientific and cultural innovations. In 1905, [[state secularism]] was [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|officially established]].

The French conquest of [[Morocco]] was one of the longest and toughest in the annals of European colonialism.

In the wake of the series of worldwide [[protests of 1968]], the [[May 1968 in France|revolt of May 1968]] had an enormous social impact.

In the post-Gaullist era, France remained one of the most developed [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|economies in the world]], but faced several economic crises that resulted in high unemployment rates and increasing public debt.

[[File:France cities.png|thumb|alt=see description|upright=1.1|A relief map of Metropolitan France, showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants.]]
[[File:Massif du Mont-Blanc (hiver panoramique).jpg|thumb|alt=Panorama of Mont Blanc mountain range above gray clouds under a blue sky|[[Mont Blanc]], the highest summit in Western Europe, marks the border with Italy.|upright=1.1]]
The vast majority of France's territory and population is situated in [[Western Europe]] and is called [[Metropolitan France]], to distinguish it from the country's various overseas polities. It is bordered by the [[North Sea]] in the north, the [[English Channel]] in the northwest, the Atlantic Ocean in the west and the Mediterranean sea in the southeast. Its land borders consist of [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]] in the northeast, Germany and [[Switzerland]] in the east, [[Italy]] and [[Monaco]] in the southeast, and [[Andorra]] and [[Spain]] in the south and southwest. With the exception of the northeast, most of France's land borders are roughly delineated by natural boundaries and geographic features: to the south and southeast, the Pyrenees and the Alps and the Jura, respectively, and to the east, the Rhine river. Due to its shape, France is often referred to as ''{{lang|fr|l'Hexagone}}'' ("The [[Hexagon]]"). Metropolitan France includes various coastal islands, of which the largest is [[Corsica]]. Metropolitan France is situated mostly between latitudes [[41st parallel north|41°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian west|6° W]] and [[10th meridian east|10° E]], on the western edge of Europe, and thus lies within the northern [[temperateness|temperate]] zone. Its continental part covers about 1000&nbsp;km from north to south and from east to west.

France has several [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas regions]] across the world, which are organized as follows:
* In South America: [[French Guiana]].
* In the Atlantic Ocean: [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and, in the Antilles: [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Collectivity of Saint Martin|Saint Martin]] and [[Saint Barthélemy]].
* In the Pacific Ocean: [[French Polynesia]], the special collectivity of [[New Caledonia]], [[Wallis and Futuna]] and [[Clipperton Island]].
* In the Indian Ocean: [[Réunion island]], [[Mayotte]], [[Kerguelen Islands]], [[Crozet Islands]], [[Île Saint-Paul|St. Paul]] and [[Île Amsterdam|Amsterdam]] islands, and the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean]]
* In the Antarctic: [[Adélie Land]].

France has land borders with [[Brazil]] and [[Suriname]] via [[French Guiana]] and with the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]] through the French portion of [[Saint Martin]].

Metropolitan France covers {{convert|551500|km2|sqmi|0}},<ref name=France /> the largest among [[European Union]] members.<ref name = superficy>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/france/index_en.htm |title=Europa Official Site&nbsp;– France |accessdate=28 October 2014 |publisher=EU}}</ref> France's total land area, with its overseas departments and territories (excluding [[Adélie Land]]), is {{convert|643801|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, 0.45% of the total land area on Earth. France possesses a wide variety of landscapes, from coastal plains in the north and west to mountain ranges of the [[Alps]] in the southeast, the [[Massif Central]] in the south central and [[Pyrenees]] in the southwest.

Due to its numerous [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas departments and territories]] scattered across the planet, France possesses the second-largest [[Exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) in the world, covering 11,035,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (4,260,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), just behind the EEZ of the United States, which covers 11,351,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (4,383,000&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>), but ahead of the EEZ of Australia, which covers 8,148,250&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (4,111,312&nbsp;mi<sup>2</sup>). Its EEZ covers approximately 8% of the total surface of all the EEZs of the world.

=== Geology, topography and hydrography ===
[[File:Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil - Grotte du Grand Roc 13.JPG|thumb|Caves in [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil]], part of the [[UNESCO]] Prehistoric Sites and [[Lascaux|Decorated Caves]] of the [[Vézère|Vézère Valley]].]]
[[File:2013.07.05 roussillon - roque anthéron 172.JPG|thumb|Geological formations near [[Roussillon, Vaucluse]] dating back to [[Post-classical history]].]]
Metropolitan France has a wide variety of topographical sets and natural landscapes. Large parts of the current territory of France were raised during several tectonic episodes like the Hercynian uplift in the Paleozoic Era, during which the [[Armorican Massif]], the [[Massif Central]], the [[Morvan]], the [[Vosges]] and [[Ardennes]] ranges and the island of [[Corsica]] were formed. These massifs delineate several sedimentary basins such as the Aquitaine basin in the southwest and the Paris basin in the north, the latter including several areas of particularly fertile ground such as the silt beds of Beauce and Brie. Various routes of natural passage, such as the Rhône valley, allow easy communications. The Alpine, Pyrenean and Jura mountains are much younger and have less eroded forms. At {{convert|4810.45|m|ft|0}}<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/mont-blanc-shrinks-by-45cm-in-two-years-20091106-i0kk.html |title=Mont Blanc shrinks by {{convert|45|cm|2 |abbr=on}} in two years |work=Sydney Morning Herald |date=6 November 2009 |accessdate=9 August 2010}}</ref> above sea level, [[Mont Blanc]], located in the Alps on the French and Italian border, is the highest point in Western Europe.

Although 60% of municipalities are classified as having seismic risks, these risks remain moderate. The coastlines offer contrasting landscapes: mountain ranges along the [[French Riviera]], coastal cliffs such as the [[Côte d'Albâtre]], and wide sandy plains in the [[Languedoc]]. Corsica lies off the Mediterranean coast. France has an extensive river system consisting of the four major rivers [[Seine]], the [[Loire]], the [[Garonne]], the [[Rhône]] and their tributaries, whose combined catchment includes over 62% of the metropolitan territory. The Rhône divides the Massif Central from the Alps and flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the [[Camargue]]. Other water courses drain towards the Meuse and Rhine along the north-eastern borders. France has {{convert|11|e6km2}} of marine waters within three oceans under its jurisdiction, of which 97% are overseas.

===Climate===
Most of the low-lying areas of metropolitan France are located in the oceanic climate zone, Cfb and Cfc in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]. Corsica and a small part of the territory bordering the mediterranean basin lies in the Csa and Csb zones. As the French metropolitan territory is relatively large, the climate is not uniform, giving rise to the following climate nuances:
* The west of France has strictly [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb)&nbsp;– it extends from [[French Flanders|Flanders]] to the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country]] in a coastal strip several tens of kilometres wide, narrower to the north and south but wider in [[Brittany]], which is almost entirely in this climate zone.
** The climate of the Southwest is also oceanic but warmer.
** The climate of the Northwest is oceanic but cooler and windier.
** Away from the coast, the climate is oceanic throughout but its characteristics change somewhat. The Paris sedimentary basin and, more so, the basins protected by mountain chains show a stronger seasonal temperature variability and less rainfall during autumn and winter. Therefore, most of the territory has a semi-oceanic climate and forms a transition zone between strictly oceanic climate near the coasts and other climate zones.
* The [[Continental climate|semi-continental climate]] (Dfa) of the north and centre-east (Alsace, plains of the Saône, the middle part of the Rhône, [[Dauphiné]], [[Auvergne]] and [[Savoy]]).
* The Mediterranean and the lower Rhône valley experience a [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa and Csb) due to the effect of mountain chains isolating them from the rest of the country and the resulting [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]] and [[Tramontane]] winds.
* The [[mountain climate|mountain (or alpine) climates]] (Dfc and ET) are confined to the [[French Alps|Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]] and the summits of the [[Massif Central]], the [[Jura Mountains|Jura]] and the [[Vosges]].
* In the [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas regions]], there are three broad types of climate:
** A [[tropical climate]] (Am) in most overseas regions including eastern [[French Guiana]]: high constant temperature throughout the year with a dry and a wet season.
** An [[equatorial climate]] (Af) in western [[French Guiana]]: high constant temperature with even precipitation throughout the year.
** A [[Subarctic climate|subpolar climate]] (Et) in [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] and in most of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]: short mild summers and long very cold winters.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of France}}
The French Republic is divided into 18 [[Regions of France|regions]] (located in [[Europe]] and overseas), five [[Overseas collectivities of France|overseas collectivities]], one [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]], one special collectivity – [[New Caledonia]] and one uninhabited island directly under the authority of the Minister of Overseas France – [[Clipperton Island|Clipperton]].

;Regions
{{France Regions Labelled Map}}

Since 2016 France is mainly divided into 18 administrative regions: 13 regions in [[metropolitan France]] (including the territorial collectivity of [[Corsica]]),<ref>{{cite web |title=La réforme territoriale |language=fr |url=http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/la-reforme-territoriale |publisher=Government of France |date=18 December 2015 |accessdate=1 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151230075909/http://www.gouvernement.fr/action/la-reforme-territoriale |archivedate=30 December 2015 |df=}}</ref> and five located [[overseas region|overseas]].<ref name=France /> The regions are further subdivided into 101 departments,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.myfrenchproperty.com/departments/departments.php |title=Departments of France |language=fr |publisher=Myfrenchproperty.com |accessdate=21 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714142645/http://www.myfrenchproperty.com/departments/departments.php |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=}}</ref> which are numbered mainly alphabetically. This number is used in postal codes and was formerly used on vehicle number plates. Among the 101 departments of France, five ([[French Guiana]], [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]], and [[Réunion]]) are in overseas regions (ROMs) that are also simultaneously overseas departments (DOMs), enjoy exactly the same status as metropolitan departments and are an integral part of the European Union.

The 101 departments are subdivided into 335 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]], which are, in turn, subdivided into 2,054 [[Cantons of France|cantons]].<ref name=constituencies>{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=99&ref_id=t_0203R |title=Circonscriptions administratives au 1er janvier 2015 : comparaisons régionales |trans-title=Administrative constituencies of 1 January 2015: regional comparisons |language=fr |publisher=[[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]] |accessdate=5 July 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430033500/http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/tableau.asp?reg_id=99&ref_id=t_0203R |archivedate=30 April 2014}}</ref> These cantons are then divided into 36,658 [[Communes of France|communes]], which are municipalities with an elected municipal council.<ref name=constituencies /> Three communes—Paris, Lyon and Marseille—are subdivided into 45 [[Municipal arrondissements of France|municipal arrondissements]].

The regions, departments and communes are all known as [[territorial collectivity|territorial collectivities]], meaning they possess local assemblies as well as an executive. Arrondissements and cantons are merely administrative divisions. However, this was not always the case. Until 1940, the arrondissements were territorial collectivities with an elected assembly, but these were suspended by the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and definitely abolished by the [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] in 1946.

;Overseas territories and collectivities

Until World War II, [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] were a strong political force in France, embodied by the [[Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party]] which was the most important party of the Third Republic. Since World War II, they were marginalized while French politics became characterised by two politically opposed groupings: one left-wing, centred on the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] and its successor the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (since 1969); and the other right-wing, centred on the [[Gaullist Party]], whose name changed over time to the [[Rally of the French People]] (1947), the [[Union of Democrats for the Republic]] (1958), the [[Rally for the Republic]] (1976), the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (2007) and [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]] (since 2015). In the 2017 presidential and legislative elections, [[Radical centrism|radical centrist]] party [[En Marche!]] became the dominant force, overtaking both Socialists and Republicans.

===Law===
{{Main|Law of France}}
France uses a [[civil law (legal system)|civil legal]] system;<ref name=France /> that is, law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to [[case law]]). Basic principles of the [[rule of law]] were laid in the [[Napoleonic Code]] (which was, in turn, largely based on the royal law codified under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As [[Guy Canivet]], first president of the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]], wrote about the management of prisons: ''Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality.'' That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy.
[[File:Declaration of Human Rights.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=color drawing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789|The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]].]]

French law is divided into two principal areas: [[private law]] and [[public law]]. Private law includes, in particular, [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] and [[criminal law]]. Public law includes, in particular, [[administrative law]] and [[constitutional law]]. However, in practical terms, French law comprises three principal areas of law: civil law, criminal law, and administrative law. Criminal laws can only address the future and not the past (criminal ''[[Ex post facto law|ex post facto]]'' laws are prohibited).<ref>In European countries, legal doctrine has long faced the question of succession of criminal laws in time: {{cite journal |last1=Buonomo |first1=Giampiero |title=La rivendicazione di Gallo |journal=Mondoperaio Edizione Online |date=2015 |url=https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89426924}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref> While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] and administrative courts are headed by the [[Conseil d'Etat (France)|Council of State]].

To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the ''[[Journal officiel de la République française]]''.

France does not recognise [[religious law]] as a motivation for the enactment of prohibitions. France has long had neither [[blasphemy]] laws nor [[sodomy law]]s (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, "offences against [[Decency|public decency]]" (''contraires aux bonnes mœurs'') or [[breach of the peace|disturbing public order]] (''trouble à l'ordre public'') have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. Since 1999, [[Pacte civil de solidarité|civil unions]] for homosexual couples are permitted, and since May 2013, [[same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT adoption]] are legal in France.<ref>{{cite news |title=François Hollande signs same-sex marriage into law |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130518-france-gay-marriage-law-adoption |accessdate=27 June 2013 |publisher=France 24 |date=18 May 2013}}</ref> Laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are [[Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881|as old as 1881]].

[[Freedom of religion in France|Freedom of religion]] is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]. The [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]] is the basis for ''[[laïcité]]'' (state secularism): the state does not formally recognize any religion, [[Concordat in Alsace-Moselle|except in Alsace-Moselle]]. Nonetheless, it does recognize religious associations. The Parliament has [[Groups referred to as cults in government reports#France|listed many religious movements as dangerous cults]] since 1995, and has [[French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools|banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools]] since 2004.

The French Armed Forces (''Forces armées françaises'') are the military and paramilitary forces of France, under the [[President of France|President of the Republic]] as supreme commander. They consist of the [[French Army]] (''Armée de Terre''), [[French Navy]] (''Marine Nationale'', formerly called ''Armée de Mer''), the [[French Air Force]] (''Armée de l'Air''), the French Strategic Nuclear Force (''Force Nucléaire Stratégique'', nicknamed ''Force de Frappe'' or "Strike Force") and the Military Police called [[National Gendarmerie]] (''Gendarmerie nationale''), which also fulfils civil police duties in the rural areas of France. Together they are among the [[List of countries by number of troops|largest armed forces]] in the world and the largest in the EU.

While the Gendarmerie is an integral part of the French armed forces (gendarmes are career soldiers), and therefore under the purview of the [[Minister of the Armed Forces (France)|Ministry of the Armed Forces]], it is operationally attached to the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]] as far as its civil police duties are concerned.

When acting as general purpose police force, the Gendarmerie encompasses the counter terrorist units of the [[Parachute Intervention Squadron of the National Gendarmerie]] (''Escadron Parachutiste d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale''), the [[National Gendarmerie Intervention Group]] (''Groupe d'Intervention de la Gendarmerie Nationale''), the Search Sections of the National Gendarmerie (''Sections de Recherche de la Gendarmerie Nationale''), responsible for criminal enquiries, and the Mobile Brigades of the National Gendarmerie (''Brigades mobiles de la Gendarmerie Nationale'', or in short ''Gendarmerie mobile'') which have the task to maintain public order.

The following special units are also part of the Gendarmerie: the [[Republican Guard (France)|Republican Guard]] (''Garde républicaine'') which protects public buildings hosting major French institutions, the Maritime Gendarmerie (''Gendarmerie maritime'') serving as Coast Guard, the Provost Service (''Prévôté''), acting as the Military Police branch of the Gendarmerie.

As far as the French intelligence units are concerned, the [[Directorate-General for External Security]] (''Direction générale de la sécurité extérieure'') is considered to be a component of the Armed Forces under the authority of the Ministry of Defence. The other, the Central Directorate for Interior Intelligence (''Direction centrale du renseignement intérieur'') is a division of the National Police Force (''Direction générale de la Police Nationale''), and therefore reports directly to the Ministry of the Interior. There has been no national [[conscription]] since 1997.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/service-civil/fin-service-militaire-obligatoire.shtml La fin du service militaire obligatoire] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808230428/http://www.ladocumentationfrancaise.fr/dossiers/service-civil/fin-service-militaire-obligatoire.shtml |date=8 August 2010 }}&nbsp;– La documentation française</ref>

France has a special military corps, the [[French Foreign Legion]], founded in 1830, which consists of foreign nationals from over 140 countries who are willing to serve in the French Armed Forces and become French citizens after the end of their service period. The only other countries having similar units are Spain (the Spanish Foreign Legion, called ''Tercio'', was founded in 1920) and Luxembourg (foreigners can serve in the National Army provided they speak Luxembourgish).

France is a [[Big Five (United Nations)|permanent member of the Security Council of the UN]], and a [[List of states with nuclear weapons#Five nuclear-weapon states under the NPT|recognised nuclear state]] since 1960.

French nuclear deterrence, (formerly known as "''[[Force de Frappe]]''"), relies on complete independence. The current French nuclear force consists of four [[Triomphant class submarine|''Triomphant'']] class submarines equipped with [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s.

Since the [[Middle Ages]], France has been a major contributor to scientific and technological achievement. Around the beginning of the 11th century, [[Pope Sylvester II]], born Gerbert d'Aurillac, reintroduced the [[abacus]] and [[armillary sphere]], and introduced [[Arabic numerals]] and [[clock]]s to Northern and Western Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog |title=Lives of the Necromancers |author=William Godwin |year=1876 |page=232}}</ref> The [[University of Paris]], founded in the mid-12th century, is still one of the most important universities in the Western world.<ref>André Thuilier, Histoire de l'université de Paris et de la Sorbonne, Paris, Nouvelle librairie de France, 1994</ref> In the 17th century, mathematician [[René Descartes]] defined a [[Rationalism|method for the acquisition of scientific knowledge]], while [[Blaise Pascal]] became famous for his work on [[probability]] and [[fluid mechanics]]. They were both key figures of the [[Scientific Revolution]], which blossomed in Europe during this period. The [[French Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]] was founded by [[Louis XIV]] to encourage and protect the spirit of French [[Scientific method|scientific research]]. It was at the forefront of scientific developments in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is one of the earliest [[academy of sciences|academies of sciences]].

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] was marked by the work of biologist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]] and chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]], who discovered the role of [[oxygen]] in [[combustion]], while [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert|D'Alembert]] published the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', which aimed to give access to "useful knowledge" to the people, a knowledge that they can apply to their everyday life.<ref>Burke, Peter, A social history of knowledge: from Gutenberg to Diderot, Malden: Blackwell Publishers Inc., 2000, p. 17</ref> With the [[Industrial Revolution]], the 19th century saw spectacular scientific developments in France with scientists such as [[Augustin Fresnel]], founder of modern [[optics]], [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] who laid the foundations of [[thermodynamics]], and [[Louis Pasteur]], a pioneer of [[microbiology]].

This was the highest rate since the end of the [[baby boom]] in 1973, and coincides with the rise of the [[total fertility rate]] from a nadir of 1.7 in 1994 to 2.0 in 2010. {{as of|January 2017}} the fertility rate was 1.93.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bilan démographique 2016 |url=https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2554860 |publisher=Insee |accessdate=19 January 2017 |language=fr }}</ref><ref name=population>{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/themes/document.asp?ref_id=ip1332 |title=Bilan démographique 2010 |publisher=Insee |accessdate=20 January 2011 |language=fr }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/irweb/sd2008/dd/excel/sd2008_t44_fe.xls |title=Tableau 44&nbsp;– Taux de fécondité générale par âge de la mère |publisher=Insee |accessdate=20 January 2011 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427013815/http://www.insee.fr/fr/ppp/bases-de-donnees/irweb/sd2008/dd/excel/sd2008_t44_fe.xls |archivedate=27 April 2011}}</ref>

===Ethnic groups===
Most [[French people]] are of [[Celtic peoples|Celtic]] ([[Gauls]]) origin, with an admixture of [[Italic peoples|Italic]] ([[Roman Empire|Romans]]) and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] ([[Franks]]) groups.<ref>{{cite book |author=Jean-Louis Brunaux |title=Nos ancêtres les Gaulois |trans-title=Our ancestors the Gauls |editor=Seuil |date=2008 |page=261}}</ref> Different regions reflect this diverse heritage, with notable [[Bretons|Breton]] elements in western France, [[Aquitani]]an in the southwest, [[Scandinavia]]n in the northwest, [[Alemanni]]c in the northeast and [[Ligures|Ligurian]] influence in the southeast. Large-scale [[immigration]] over the last century and a half has led to a more multicultural society. In 2004, the Institut Montaigne estimated that within Metropolitan France, 51 million people were White (85% of the population), 6 million were Northwest African (10%), 2 million were Black (3.3%), and 1 million were Asian (1.7%).<ref>{{cite book |author1=Yazid Sabeg |author2=Laurence Méhaignerie |author1-link=Yazid Sabeg |language=fr |url=http://www.conventioncitoyenne.com/documents/oubliesdelegalite.pdf |title=Les oubliés de l'égalité des chances |trans-title=The forgotten of equal opportunities |publisher=[[Institut Montaigne]] |date=January 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13377324 |title=France's ethnic minorities: To count or not to count |publisher=[[The Economist]] |date=26 March 2009 |accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>

According to Article 2 of the Constitution, the official language of France is French,<ref>{{fr icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20110604145028/http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/html/constitution/constitution2.htm La Constitution- La Constitution du 4 Octobre 1958]&nbsp;– Légifrance</ref> a [[Romance language]] derived from [[Latin]]. Since 1635, the [[Académie française]] has been France's official authority on the French language, although its recommendations carry no legal weight. There are also regional languages spoken in France, such as [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French Flemish|Flemish]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] dialect), [[Alsatian dialect|Alsatian]] ([[German language|German]] dialect), [[Basque language|Basque]], and others. (see [[Languages of France]]) [[Italian language|Italian]] was the official language of Corsica until 9 May 1859.<ref>Abalain, Hervé, (2007) ''Le français et les langues historiques de la France'', Éditions Jean-Paul Gisserot, p. 113</ref>

The French government does not regulate the choice of language in publications by individuals but the use of French is required by law in commercial and workplace communications. In addition to mandating the use of French in the territory of the Republic, the French government tries to promote French in the European Union and globally through institutions such as [[La Francophonie]]. The perceived threat from [[anglicisation]] has prompted efforts to safeguard the position of the French language in France. Besides French, there exist 77 vernacular minority languages of France, eight spoken in French metropolitan territory and 69 in the French [[Overseas departments and territories of France|overseas territories]].

From the 17th to the mid-20th century, French served as the pre-eminent international language of diplomacy and international affairs as well as a [[lingua franca]] among the educated classes of Europe.<ref name=exception>Joffre Agnes [http://www.franceinlondon.com/en-Article-335-Is-the-French-obsession-with-cultural-exception-declining-Culture--london-language.html ls the French obsession with "cultural exception" declining?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017023619/http://franceinlondon.com/en-Article-335-Is-the-French-obsession-with-cultural-exception-declining-Culture--london-language.html |date=17 October 2011 }}.

For most of the time in which French served as an international lingua franca, it was not the native language of most Frenchmen: a report in 1794 conducted by [[Henri Grégoire]] found that of the country's 25 million people, only three million spoke French natively; the rest spoke one of the country's many regional languages, such as [[Alsatian language|Alsatian]], [[Breton language|Breton]] or [[Occitan language|Occitan]].<ref>[http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 Rapport Grégoire an II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405022802/http://www.languefrancaise.net/dossiers/dossiers.php?id_dossier=66 |date=5 April 2008 }}</ref> Through the expansion of public education, in which French was the sole language of instruction, as well as other factors such as increased urbanisation and the rise of mass communication, French gradually came to be adopted by virtually the entire population, a process not completed until the 20th century.

As a result of France's extensive [[French colonial empire|colonial ambitions]] between the 17th and 20th centuries, French was introduced to the Americas, Africa, Polynesia, South-East Asia, and the Caribbean. French is the second most studied foreign language in the world after English,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intstudy.com/articles/practicalfrench.htm |title=The International Education Site |publisher=Intstudy.com |accessdate=23 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227075911/http://www.intstudy.com/articles/practicalfrench.htm |archivedate=27 February 2011 |df=}}</ref> and is a lingua franca in some regions, notably in Africa. The legacy of French as a living language outside Europe is mixed: it is nearly extinct in some former French colonies (The Levant, South and Southeast Asia), while creoles and pidgins based on French have emerged in the French departments in the [[West Indies]] and the South Pacific ([[French Polynesia]]). On the other hand, many former French colonies have adopted French as an official language, and the total number of French speakers is increasing, especially in Africa.

France is a [[secular]] country, and [[freedom of religion]] is a constitutional right. French religious policy is based on the concept of ''[[laïcité]]'', a strict [[separation of church and state]] under which public life is kept completely secular.

According to a survey held in 2016 by [[Institut Montaigne]] and [[Institut français d'opinion publique]] (IFOP), 51.1% of the total population of France was Christian as of that year; at the same time 39.6% of the population had no religion ([[atheism]] or [[agnosticism]]), 5.6% were [[Muslim]]s, 2.5% were followers of other faiths, and the remaining 0.4% were undecided about their faith.<ref name="2016Montaigne-IFOP"/> Estimates of the number of [[Islam in France|Muslims in France]] vary widely. In 2003, the French Ministry of the Interior estimated the total number of people of Muslim background to be between 5 and 6 million (8–10%).<ref>{{cite news |author=Jon Henley |date=22 April 2004 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/23/france.islam |title=France to train imams in 'French Islam' |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51552.htm |title=France&nbsp;– International Religious Freedom Report 2005 |publisher=U.S. State Department |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> The current [[Jews in France|Jewish community in France]] ({{as of|lc=y|2016}}, about 0.8% of the population are [[Judaism|religious Jews]]<ref name="2016Montaigne-IFOP"/>) is the largest in Europe and the third-largest in the world, after those in Israel and the United States.

[[Catholicism]] has been the predominant religion in France for more than a millennium, though it is not as actively practised today as it was. Among the 47,000 religious buildings in France, 94% are [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Observatoire du patrimoine religieux |url=http://www.patrimoine-religieux.fr/rubriques/gauche/actualites/actualites-de-la-base-de-donnees |date=1 February 2012 |quote=94 % des édifices sont catholiques (dont 50 % églises paroissiales, 25 % chapelles, 25 % édifices appartenant au clergé régulier) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131126171213/http://www.patrimoine-religieux.fr/rubriques/gauche/actualites/actualites-de-la-base-de-donnees |archivedate=26 November 2013 |df=}}</ref> During the [[French Revolution]], activists conducted a brutal [[dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|campaign of de-Christianisation]], ending the Catholic Church as the state religion. In some cases clergy and churches were attacked, with iconoclasm stripping the churches of statues and ornament. After the back and forth of Catholic royal and secular republican governments during the 19th century, France established ''[[laïcité]]'' by passage of the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]].<ref name="georgetown2">{{cite web |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |title=France |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |accessdate=14 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206213909/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |archivedate=6 February 2011}}</ref>

Since 1905 the French Government has followed the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'', in which it is prohibited from recognising any specific right to a religious community (except for legacy statutes like those of military chaplains and the [[local law in Alsace-Moselle]]). It recognises religious organisations according to formal legal criteria that do not address religious doctrine. Conversely, religious organisations are expected to refrain from intervening in policy-making.<ref>''Joy of Sects'', Sam Jordison, 2006, p. 166</ref> Certain groups, such as [[Scientology]], [[Children of God (New Religious Movement)|Children of God]], the [[Unification Church]], or the [[Order of the Solar Temple]], are considered [[cult]]s ("''[[sect#Corresponding words in other European languages|sectes]]''" in French),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/rap-enq/r2468.asp |title=Commission d'enquête sur les sectes |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |accessdate=30 October 2010}}</ref> and therefore do not have the same status as recognised religions in France.

Nowadays, the schooling system in France is centralised, and is composed of three stages, primary education, secondary education, and higher education. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[OECD]], ranked France's education as about the OECD average in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.compareyourcountry.org/pisa/country/fra?lg=en |title=Compare your country – PISA 2015 |publisher=}}</ref> Primary and secondary education are predominantly public, run by the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Ministry of National Education]]. In France, education is compulsory from six to sixteen years old, and the public school is secular and free. While training and remuneration of teachers and the curriculum are the responsibility of the state centrally, the management of primary and secondary schools is overseen by local authorities. Primary education comprises two phases, nursery school (''école maternelle'') and elementary school (''école élémentaire''). Nursery school aims to stimulate the minds of very young children and promote their socialisation and development of a basic grasp of language and number. Around the age of six, children transfer to elementary school, whose primary objectives are learning about writing, arithmetic and citizenship. Secondary education also consists of two phases. The first is delivered through colleges (''collège'') and leads to the national certificate ([[Diplôme national du brevet]]). The second is offered in high schools (''lycée'') and finishes in national exams leading to a baccalaureate (''baccalauréat'', available in professional, technical or general flavours) or certificate of professional competence (''certificat d'aptitude professionelle'').

[[Education in France#Higher education|Higher education]] is divided between [[Universities in France|public universities]] and the prestigious and selective ''[[Grandes écoles]]'', such as [[Sciences Po Paris]] for Political studies, [[HEC Paris]] for Economics, [[Polytechnique]] and the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]] that produce high-profile engineers, or the [[École nationale d'administration]] for careers in the [[Grands corps de l'État|Grands Corps]] of the state. The ''Grandes écoles'' have been criticised for alleged [[elitism]];<ref name="gécoles">{{fr icon}} [http://www.lefigaro.fr/formation/2010/01/08/01015-20100108ARTFIG00525-les-grandes-ecoles-dans-la-tourmente-.php Les grandes écoles dans la tourmente]&nbsp;– [[Le Figaro]]</ref> they have produced many if not most of France's high-ranking civil servants, CEOs, and politicians.

Since Liberty is part of the motto "[[Liberté, égalité, fraternité]]", as the French put it, this painting has become the primary symbol of the French Republic]]
France has been a centre of Western cultural development for centuries. Many French artists have been among the most renowned of their time, and France is still recognised in the world for its rich cultural tradition.

The successive political regimes have always promoted artistic creation, and the creation of the [[Minister of Culture (France)|Ministry of Culture]] in 1959 helped preserve the cultural heritage of the country and make it available to the public. The Ministry of Culture has been very active since its creation, granting subsidies to artists, promoting French culture in the world, supporting festivals and cultural events, protecting [[Monument historique|historical monuments]]. The French government also succeeded in maintaining a [[cultural exception]] to defend audiovisual products made in the country.

France receives the highest number of tourists per year, largely thanks to the numerous cultural establishments and historical buildings implanted all over the territory. It counts 1,200 [[List of museums in France|museums]] welcoming more than 50&nbsp;million people annually.<ref>Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication, "Cultura statistics", [http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/culture/deps/2008/pdf/minichiffrescles2010-en.pdf Key figures]</ref> The most important cultural sites are run by the government, for instance through the public agency [[Centre des monuments nationaux]], which is responsible for approximately 85 national historical monuments.

The 43,180 buildings protected as historical monuments include mainly residences (many [[List of castles in France|castles]]) and religious buildings ([[List of cathedrals in France|cathedrals]], [[List of basilicas in France|basilicas]], [[church (building)|churches]]), but also statutes, memorials and [[Gardens of France|gardens]].

===Art===
{{Main|French art}}
The origins of French art were very much influenced by [[Flemish art]] and by [[Italian art]] at the time of the Renaissance. [[Jean Fouquet]], the most famous medieval French painter, is said to have been the first to travel to Italy and experience the Early Renaissance at first hand. The Renaissance painting [[School of Fontainebleau]] was directly inspired by Italian painters such as [[Primaticcio]] and [[Rosso Fiorentino]], who both worked in France. Two of the most famous French artists of the time of [[Baroque era]], [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Claude Lorrain]], lived in Italy.

[[File:Claude Monet 023.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=painting by Claude Monet of woman with parasol facing left in field from the Musée d'Orsay|[[Claude Monet]] founded the [[Impressionist]] movement (''Femme avec un parasol'', 1886, [[Musée d'Orsay]]).]]
The 17th century was the period when French painting became prominent and individualised itself through classicism. Louis XIV's prime minister [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] founded in 1648 the [[Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture]] to protect these artists, and in 1666 he created the still-active [[French Academy in Rome]] to have direct relations with Italian artists.

French artists developed the [[rococo]] style in the 18th century, as a more intimate imitation of old baroque style, the works of the court-endorsed artists [[Antoine Watteau]], [[François Boucher]] and [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] being the most representative in the country. The French Revolution brought great changes, as [[Napoleon]] favoured artists of [[neoclassicism|neoclassic style]] such as [[Jacques-Louis David]] and the highly influential [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] defined the style known as [[Academism]]. At this time France had become a centre of artistic creation, the first half of the 19th century being dominated by two successive movements, at first [[Romanticism]] with [[Théodore Géricault]] and [[Eugène Delacroix]], and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] with [[Camille Corot]], [[Gustave Courbet]] and [[Jean-François Millet]], a style that eventually evolved into [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalism]].

In the second part of the 19th century, France's influence over painting became even more important, with the development of new styles of painting such as [[Impressionism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. The most famous impressionist painters of the period were [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]], Claude Monet and [[Auguste Renoir]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/learn-about-art/guide-to-impressionism/guide-to-impressionism |title=Guide to Impressionism |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref> The second generation of impressionist-style painters, [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Georges Seurat]], were also at the avant-garde of artistic evolutions,<ref>{{fr icon}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/063/article_34792.asp Le néo-impressionnisme de Seurat à Paul Klee] 15 March 2005</ref> as well as the [[fauvism|fauvist artists]] [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]] and [[Maurice de Vlaminck]].<ref>National Gallery of Art (United States), [http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/fauve/index.shtm The Fauves (dossier)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105195501/http://www.nga.gov/feature/artnation/fauve/index.shtm |date=5 November 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{fr icon}} RFI, [http://www.rfi.fr/culturefr/articles/098/article_63189.asp Vlaminck, version fauve], 25 February 2008</ref>

At the beginning of the 20th century, Cubism was developed by [[Georges Braque]] and the Spanish painter [[Pablo Picasso]], living in Paris. Other foreign artists also settled and worked in or near Paris, such as [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].

Many museums in France are entirely or partly devoted to sculptures and painting works. A huge collection of old masterpieces created before or during the 18th century are displayed in the state-owned [[Musée du Louvre]], such as [[Mona Lisa]], also known as La Joconde. While the [[Louvre Palace]] has been for a long time a museum, the Musée d'Orsay was inaugurated in 1986 in the old railway station [[Gare d'Orsay]], in a major reorganisation of national art collections, to gather French paintings from the second part of the 19th century (mainly Impressionism and Fauvism movements).<ref>Musée d'Orsay (official website), History of the museum&nbsp;– [http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-museum/home.html From station to museum]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/history-of-the-collections/painting.html |title=History of the painting collection |publisher=Musee-orsay.fr |date=31 July 2007 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

During the Middle Ages, many fortified [[castle]]s were built by feudal nobles to mark their powers. Some French castles that survived are [[Chinon (castle)|Chinon]], [[Château d'Angers]], the massive [[Château de Vincennes]] and the so-called [[Cathar castles]]. During this era, France had been using [[Romanesque architecture]] like most of Western Europe.

It was the time of the [[French Renaissance]] and several artists from Italy were invited to the French court; many residential palaces were built in the [[Loire Valley]], from 1450 with as a first reference the [[Château de Montsoreau]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.valdeloire-travel.com/en/product/chateau-de-montsoreau/|title=Come to visit the most beautiful village in France in Montsoreau|work=Val de Loire Travel|access-date=10 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.valdeloire.org/Connaitre/Au-fil-de-l-histoire/Le-Val-de-Loire-siege-du-pouvoir-royal/Charles-VII-et-Louis-XI|title=Charles VII et Louis XI -Know -Val de Loire patrimoine mondial|last=Loire|first=Mission Val de|date=|website=loirevalley-worldheritage.org|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> Such residential castles were the [[Château de Chambord]], the [[Château de Chenonceau]], or the [[Château d'Amboise]].

Following the renaissance and the end of the Middle Ages, [[French Baroque architecture|Baroque architecture]] replaced the traditional Gothic style. However, in France, baroque architecture found a greater success in the secular domain than in a religious one.<ref>{{fr icon}} Claude Lébedel&nbsp;– Les Splendeurs du Baroque en France: ''Histoire et splendeurs du baroque en France'' page 9: "Si en allant plus loin, on prononce les mots 'art baroque en France', on provoque alors le plus souvent une moue interrogative, parfois seulement étonnée, parfois franchement réprobatrice: Mais voyons, l'art baroque n'existe pas en France!"</ref> In the secular domain, the [[Palace of Versailles]] has many baroque features.

After the Revolution, the [[Republicanism|Republicans]] favoured [[Neoclassicism]] although it was introduced in France prior to the revolution with such buildings as the [[Panthéon, Paris|Parisian Pantheon]] or the [[Capitole de Toulouse]]. Built during the first French Empire, the [[Arc de Triomphe]] and [[Église de la Madeleine|Sainte Marie-Madeleine]] represent the best example of [[Empire style]] architecture.<ref>{{cite book |title=Paris: City Guide |year=2008 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74059-850-7 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=OtabdzMdbboC&pg=PA48}}</ref>

Under [[Napoleon III]], a new wave of urbanism and architecture was given birth; extravagant buildings such as the neo-baroque [[Palais Garnier]] were built. The urban planning of the time was very organised and rigorous; for example, [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]]. The architecture associated to this era is named [[Second Empire (architecture)|Second Empire]] in English, the term being taken from the [[Second French Empire]]. At this time there was a strong Gothic resurgence across Europe and in France; the associated architect was [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]]. In the late 19th century, [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed many bridges, such as [[Garabit viaduct]], and remains one of the most influential bridge designers of his time, although he is best remembered for the iconic [[Eiffel Tower]].

In the 20th century, French-Swiss architect [[Le Corbusier]] designed several buildings in France. More recently, French architects have combined both modern and old architectural styles. The [[Louvre Pyramid]] is an example of modern architecture added to an older building. The most difficult buildings to integrate within French cities are skyscrapers, as they are visible from afar. For instance, in Paris, since 1977, new buildings had to be under 37 meters (121 feet).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html |title=Urbanisme : Des gratte-ciel à Paris : qu'en pensez-vous ?nbsp;– Posez vos questions |publisher=MYTF1News |author=Henri SECKEL |date=8 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029152433/http://lci.tf1.fr/posez-vos-questions/2008-07/gratte-ciel-paris-pensez-vous-4872555.html |archivedate=29 October 2010 |df=}}</ref> France's largest financial district is [[La Defense]], where a significant number of skyscrapers are located.<ref>[http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html In the heart of the main European Business area] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729154317/http://www.groupenci.com/uk/ile-de-france/defense.com-square.html |date=29 July 2010 }}&nbsp;– NCI Business Center</ref> Other massive buildings that are a challenge to integrate into their environment are large bridges; an example of the way this has been done is the [[Millau Viaduct]].

===Literature===
{{Main|French literature}}
The earliest French literature dates from the [[Middle Age]]s, when what is now known as modern France did not have a single, uniform language. There were several languages and dialects, and writers used their own spelling and grammar. Some authors of French mediaeval texts are unknown, such as ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]'' and ''[[Lancelot-Grail]]''. Other authors are known, for example [[Chrétien de Troyes]] and [[William IX of Aquitaine|Duke William IX of Aquitaine]], who wrote in [[Occitan]].

Much medieval French poetry and literature were inspired by the legends of the [[Matter of France]], such as ''[[The Song of Roland]]'' and the various [[chansons de geste]]. The ''Roman de Renart'', written in 1175 by Perrout de Saint Cloude, tells the story of the mediaeval character [[Reynard]] ('the Fox') and is another example of early French writing. An important 16th-century writer was [[François Rabelais]], whose novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' has remained famous and appreciated until now. [[Michel de Montaigne]] was the other major figure of the French literature during that century. His most famous work, ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'', created the literary genre of the essay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |title=Montaigne |publisher=Humanistictexts.org |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525201508/http://www.humanistictexts.org/montaigne.htm |archivedate=25 May 2011  }}</ref> [[French poetry]] during that century was embodied by [[Pierre de Ronsard]] and [[Joachim du Bellay]]. Both writers founded the [[La Pléiade]] literary movement.

During the 17th century, [[Madame de La Fayette]] published anonymously ''[[La Princesse de Clèves]]'', a novel that is considered to be one of the very first [[psychological novel]]s of all times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiodramareviews.com/id438.html |title=La Princesse de Cleves by Madame de Lafayette, adapted by Jo Clifford |publisher=Radiodramareviews.com |date=28 February 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810091607/http://www.radiodramareviews.com/id438.html |archivedate=10 August 2011 }}</ref> [[Jean de La Fontaine]] is one of the most famous [[fabulist]]s of that time, as he wrote hundreds of fables, some being far more famous than others, such as ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''. Generations of French pupils had to learn his fables, that were seen as helping teaching [[wisdom]] and [[common sense]] to the young people. Some of his verses have entered the popular language to become proverbs, such as "''À l'œuvre, on connaît l'artisan."[A workman is known by his chips].''<ref>[[Jean de La Fontaine]], ''Fables'' (1668–1679), I., 21, ''Les Frelons et les Mouches à miel''; reported in Thomas Benfield Harbottle and Philip Hugh Dalbiac, ''Dictionary of Quotations (French and Italian)'' (1904), p. 1.</ref>

[[Jean Racine]], whose incredible mastery of the [[alexandrine]] and of the French language has been praised for centuries, created plays such as ''[[Phèdre]]'' or ''[[Britannicus]]''. He is, along with [[Pierre Corneille]] (''[[Le Cid]]'') and Molière, considered as one of the three great dramatists of France's [[Louis XIV of France#Patronage o the arts|golden age]]. Molière, who is deemed to be one of the greatest masters of comedy of the [[Western literature]],<ref>"Author of some of the finest comedies in the history of the theater". Hartnoll, Phyllis (ed.). The Oxford Companion to the Theatre, 1983, Oxford University Press, p. 554</ref> wrote [[Molière#List of major works|dozens of plays]], including ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'', ''[[L'Avare]]'', ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', and ''[[Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme]]''.

French literature and poetry flourished even more in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Denis Diderot]]'s best-known works are ''[[Jacques the Fatalist]]'' and ''[[Rameau's Nephew]]''. He is however best known for being the main redactor of the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', whose aim was to sum up all the knowledge of his century (in fields such as arts, sciences, languages, and philosophy) and to present them to the people, in order to fight ignorance and [[obscurantism]]. During that same century, [[Charles Perrault]] was a prolific writer of famous children's fairy tales including ''[[Puss in Boots]]'', ''[[Cinderella]]'', ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'' and ''[[Bluebeard]]''. At the start of the 19th century, [[symbolist poetry]] was an important movement in French literature, with poets such as Charles Baudelaire, [[Paul Verlaine]] and [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://users.skynet.be/litterature/symbolisme/symbolismefrancais.htm Le symbolisme français]</ref>

The 19th century saw the writings of many renowned French authors.

Other major authors of that century include [[Alexandre Dumas]] (''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte-Cristo]]''), [[Jules Verne]] (''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''), [[Émile Zola]] (''[[Les Rougon-Macquart]]''), [[Honoré de Balzac]] (''[[La Comédie humaine]]''), [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Stendhal]] (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]''), whose works are among the most well known in France and the world.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|French philosophy}}
Medieval philosophy was dominated by [[Scholasticism]] until the emergence of [[Humanism in France|Humanism]] in the Renaissance. [[Modern philosophy]] began in France in the 17th century with the philosophy of [[René Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], and [[Nicolas Malebranche]]. Descartes revitalised [[Western philosophy]], which had been declined after the Greek and Roman eras.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.friesian.com/hist-2.htm |title=The Beginning of Modern Sciences |publisher=Friesian.com |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref> His ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' changed the primary object of philosophical thought and raised some of the most fundamental problems for foreigners such as [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].
[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van René Descartes.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Frans Hals painting of René Descartes facing right in black coat and white collar|[[René Descartes]], founder of modern philosophy.]]

French philosophers produced some of the most important political works of the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. In ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', [[Baron de Montesquieu]] theorised the principle of [[separation of powers]], which has been implemented in all [[liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] since [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution|it was first applied in the United States]]. [[Voltaire]] came to embody the Enlightenment with his defence of civil liberties, such as the right to a free trial and freedom of religion.

19th-century French thought was targeted at responding to the social malaise following the French Revolution. Rationalist philosophers such as [[Victor Cousin]] and [[Auguste Comte]], who called for a new social doctrine, were opposed by reactionary thinkers such as [[Joseph de Maistre]], [[Louis de Bonald]] and [[Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais|Félicité Robert de Lamennais]], who blamed the rationalist rejection of traditional order. De Maistre is considered, together with the Englishman [[Edmund Burke]], one of the founders of European conservatism, while Comte is regarded as the founder of [[positivism]], which [[Émile Durkheim]] reformulated as a basis for social research.

In the 20th century, partly as a reaction to the perceived excesses of positivism, French [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualism]] thrived with thinkers such as [[Henri Bergson]] and it influenced American [[pragmatism]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s version of [[process philosophy]]. Meanwhile, French epistemology became a prominent school of thought with [[Jules Henri Poincaré]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], [[Jean Cavaillès]] and [[Jules Vuillemin]]. Influenced by German [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]], the philosophy of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] gained a strong influence after World War II, and late-20th-century-France became the cradle of [[postmodern philosophy]] with [[Jean-François Lyotard]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Michel Foucault]].

===Music===
{{Main|Music of France}}
France has a long and varied musical history. It experienced a golden age in the 17th century thanks to Louis XIV, who employed a number of talented musicians and composers in the royal court. The most renowned composers of this period include [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]], [[François Couperin]], [[Michel-Richard Delalande]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] and [[Marin Marais]], all of them composers at the court. After the death of the "Roi Soleil", French musical creation lost dynamism, but in the next century the music of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]] reached some prestige, and today he is still one of the most renowned French composers. Rameau became the dominant composer of [[French opera]] and the leading French composer for the harpsichord.<ref>Girdlestone p. 14: "It is customary to couple him with Couperin as one couples Haydn with Mozart or Ravel with Debussy."</ref>{{full citation needed |date=January 2018}}

[[File:Berlioz Petit BNF Gallica-crop2.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hector Berlioz]], 1863]]
French composers played an important role during the music of the 19th and early 20th century, which is considered to be the [[Romantic music]] era. Romantic music emphasised a surrender to nature, a fascination with the past and the supernatural, the exploration of unusual, strange and surprising sounds, and a focus on national identity. This period was also a golden age for operas. French composers from the Romantic era included: [[Hector Berlioz]] (best known for his ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]''), [[Georges Bizet]] (best known for ''[[Carmen]]'', which has become one of the most popular and frequently performed operas), [[Gabriel Fauré]] (best known for his ''[[Pavane (Fauré)|Pavane]]'', [[Requiem (Fauré)|''Requiem'']], and ''[[Fauré Nocturnes|nocturnes]]''), [[Charles Gounod]] (best known for his ''[[Ave Maria (Bach/Gounod)|Ave Maria]]'' and his [[opera]] ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]''), [[Jacques Offenbach]] (best known for his 100 [[operetta]]s of the 1850s–1870s and his uncompleted opera ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann]]''), [[Édouard Lalo]] (best known for his ''[[Symphonie espagnole]]'' for violin and [[orchestra]] and his [[Cello Concerto (Lalo)|Cello Concerto in D minor]]), [[Jules Massenet]] (best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty, the most frequently staged are ''[[Manon]]'' (1884) and ''[[Werther]]'' (1892)) and [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] (he has many frequently-performed works, including ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'', ''[[Danse macabre (Saint-Saëns)|Danse macabre]]'', ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (Opera), ''[[Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso]]'' and his [[Symphony No. 3 (Saint-Saëns)|Symphony No. 3]]).

[[File:Claude Debussy 1900 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Debussy]], 1900]]
Later came precursors of modern classical music. [[Érik Satie]] was a key member of the early-20th-century Parisian [[avant-garde]], best known for his ''[[Gymnopédies]]''. [[Francis Poulenc]]'s best known works are his piano suite ''[[Trois mouvements perpétuels]]'' (1919), the ballet ''[[Les biches]]'' (1923), the ''[[Concert champêtre]]'' (1928) for [[harpsichord]] and orchestra, the opera ''[[Dialogues des Carmélites]]'' (1957), and the ''[[Gloria (Poulenc)|Gloria]]'' (1959) for [[soprano]], choir and orchestra. [[Maurice Ravel]] and [[Claude Debussy]] are the most prominent figures associated with [[Impressionist music]]. Debussy was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and his use of non-traditional scales and [[chromaticism]] influenced many composers who followed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/claude-debussy-mn0000768781/biography |title=Claude Debussy&nbsp;– Biography&nbsp;– AllMusic |author=Allen Schrott |work=AllMusic}}</ref> Debussy's music is noted for its sensory content and frequent usage of [[atonality]].

Ravel's piano compositions, such as ''[[Jeux d'eau (Ravel)|Jeux d'eau]]'', ''[[Miroirs]]'', ''[[Le tombeau de Couperin]]'' and ''[[Gaspard de la nuit]]'', demand considerable virtuosity. His mastery of orchestration is evident in the ''[[Rapsodie espagnole]]'', ''[[Daphnis et Chloé]]'', his arrangement of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and his orchestral work ''[[Boléro]]'' (1928). More recently, the middle of the 20th century, [[Maurice Ohana]], [[Pierre Schaeffer]] and [[Pierre Boulez]] contributed to the evolutions of [[contemporary classical music]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Schwartz |first=Lloyd |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126668117 |title=Composer-Conductor Pierre Boulez At 85 |date=24 May 2010 |publisher=NPR |accessdate=22 July 2011}}</ref>

Apart from its strong and innovative film tradition, France has also been a gathering spot for artists from across Europe and the world. For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as Poland ([[Roman Polanski]], [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]], and [[Andrzej Żuławski]]), [[Argentina]] ([[Gaspar Noé]] and [[Edgardo Cozarinsky]]), Russia ([[Alexandre Alexeieff]], [[Anatole Litvak]]), Austria ([[Michael Haneke]]), and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[Géla Babluani]], [[Otar Iosseliani]]) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as [[Luc Besson]], [[Jacques Tourneur]], or [[Francis Veber]] in the [[Cinema of the United States|United States]].

===Fashion===

Fashion has been an important industry and cultural export of France since the 17th century, and modern "haute couture" originated in Paris in the 1860s. Today, Paris, along with London, Milan, and New York City, is considered one of the world's fashion capitals, and the city is home or headquarters to many of the premier fashion houses. The expression [[Haute couture]] is, in France, a legally protected name, guaranteeing certain quality standards.

The association of France with fashion and style ({{lang-fr|link=no|la mode}}) dates largely to the reign of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]<ref>Kelly, 181. DeJean, chapters 2–4.</ref> when the luxury goods industries in France came increasingly under royal control and the French royal court became, arguably, the arbiter of taste and style in Europe. But France renewed its dominance of the high fashion ({{lang-fr|link=no|couture {{noitalic|or}} haute couture}}) industry in the years 1860–1960 through the establishing of the great [[couturier]] houses such as [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior]], and [[Givenchy]]. The French perfume industry is world leader in its sector and is centered on the town of [[Grasse]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://about-france.com/tourism/french-perfume.htm |title=French perfume |publisher=About-France.com}}</ref>

In the 1960s, the elitist "Haute couture" came under criticism from France's [[May 1968 in France|youth culture]]. In 1966, the designer [[Yves Saint Laurent (designer)|Yves Saint Laurent]] broke with established Haute Couture norms by launching a [[prêt-à-porter]] ("ready to wear") line and expanding French fashion into mass manufacturing. With a greater focus on marketing and manufacturing, new trends were established by [[Sonia Rykiel]], [[Thierry Mugler]], [[Claude Montana]], [[Jean-Paul Gaultier]] and [[Christian Lacroix]] in the 1970s and 1980s. The 1990s saw a conglomeration of many French couture houses under luxury giants and multinationals such as [[LVMH]].

In 2005 the national service [[Télévision Numérique Terrestre]] introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.

The four existing national channels are now owned by state-owned consortium [[France Télévisions]], while public broadcasting group [[Radio France]] run five national radio stations. Among these public media are [[Radio France Internationale]], which broadcasts programmes in French all over the world, and Franco-German TV channel [[TV5 Monde]]. In 2006, the government created global news channel [[France 24]]. Long-established TV channels [[TF1]] (privatised in 1987), [[France 2]] and [[France 3]] have the highest shares, while radio stations [[RTL (French radio)|RTL]], [[Europe 1]] and state-owned [[France Inter]] are the least listened to.

A common and traditional symbol of the French people is the [[Gallic rooster]]. Its origins date back to Antiquity, since the Latin word Gallus meant both "[[rooster]]" and "inhabitant of Gaul".

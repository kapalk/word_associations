'''Senegal''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Senegal.ogg|ˌ|s|ɛ|n|ᵻ|ˈ|ɡ|ɔː|l|,_|-|ˈ|ɡ|ɑː|l}};<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Senegal |title=Definition of Senegal |publisher=The Free Dictionary |accessdate=6 November 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Senegal |title=Define Senegal |publisher=Dictionary.com |accessdate=6 November 2013 }}</ref> {{lang-fr|link=no|Sénégal}}), officially the '''Republic of Senegal''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|République du Sénégal}}), is a country in [[West Africa]]. Senegal is bordered by [[Mauritania]] in the north, [[Mali]] to the east, [[Guinea]] to the southeast, and [[Guinea-Bissau]] to the southwest. Senegal also borders [[The Gambia]], a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the [[Gambia River]], which separates Senegal's southern region of [[Casamance]] from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with [[Cape Verde]]. Senegal's economic and political capital is [[Dakar]].

The [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]]  is the westernmost country in the mainland of the [[Old World]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]],<ref>Janet H. Gritzner, Charles F. Gritzner – 2009, Senegal – Page 8</ref> and owes its name to the [[Senegal River]], which borders it to the east and north. Senegal covers a land area of almost {{convert|197000|km2}} and has an estimated population of about {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Senegal}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} The climate is typically [[Sahel]]ian, though there is a [[Wet season|rainy season]].

== Etymology ==
Probably from a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] transliteration of the name of the [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] also known as the [[Sanhaja]],<ref name=fas>{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/africa/senegal/articles/the-real-story-behind-senegals-name/|title=The Real Story Behind Senegal’s Name|first=Beetle|last=Holloway|website=Culture Trip}}</ref> or a combination of the supreme deity in {{w|Serer religion}} (''Rog Sene'') and ''o gal'' meaning ''body of water'' in the [[Serer language]]. Alternatively, the name could derive from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] phrase "Sunuu Gaal," which means "our boat."

== Cultures and influences ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2019}}
The territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since [[prehistory]]. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the [[Jolof Empire]]. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.

Senegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, [[phosphate]] mining, fertilizer production, [[petroleum]] refining, construction materials, and ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[green bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[mango]]es.<ref name=fas/> Owing to its relative stability, tourism and hospitality are also burgeoning sectors.

With it being a multiethnic and secular nation, Senegal is predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] with [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[traditional African religion|animist]] influences. French is the [[official language]], although many native languages are spoken and recognized. Since April 2012, Senegal's president has been [[Macky Sall]]. Senegal has been a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.

==History==
{{main|History of Senegal}}

===Early and pre-colonial eras===
Archaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: [[Takrur]] in the 9th century, {{ILL|Namandiru|wo}} and the [[Jolof Empire]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the [[Ghana Empire]].

Islam was introduced through [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids, and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.<ref>Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847–1914'', p. 7, Edinburgh University Press (1968) {{ISBN|0-8047-0621-2}}</ref><ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation Sereer, Pangool,'' p. 13. Dakar, Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1990), {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>

In the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was [[Slavery in Africa|enslaved]], typically as a result of captives taken in warfare.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 "Slavery"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica's Guide to Black History'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |date=6 October 2014 }}</ref>

In the 14th century the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united [[Cayor]] and the kingdoms of [[Baol]], [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]], [[Waalo]], [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Bambouk]], or much of present-day West Africa. The empire was a voluntary confederacy of various states rather than an empire built on military conquest.<ref name=charles/><ref>Ham, Anthony. ''West Africa.'' Lonely Planet. 2009. p. 670. {{ISBN|1-74104-821-4}}</ref> The empire was founded by Ndiadiane Ndiaye, a part [[Serer people|Serer]]<ref>''Research in African literatures,'' Volume 37.

===Colonial era===
{{Main|Senegambia (Dutch West India Company)|French conquest of Senegal}}

In the mid-15th century, the Portuguese landed on the Senegal coastline, followed by traders representing other countries, including the French.<ref name="ross"/> Various European powers—Portugal, the Netherlands, and Great Britain—competed for trade in the area from the 15th century onward. In 1677, France gained control of what had become a minor departure point in the [[Atlantic slave trade]]—the island of [[Gorée]] next to modern Dakar, used as a base to purchase slaves from the warring chiefdoms on the mainland.<ref name="h-net.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/~africa/threads/goree.html |title="Goree and the Atlantic Slave Trade", Philip Curtin, History Net, accessed 9 July 2008 |publisher=H-net.org |accessdate=20 June 2010}}</ref><ref>''Les Guides Bleus: Afrique de l'Ouest''(1958 ed.), p. 123</ref>

[[File:Marchands d'esclaves de Gorée-Jacques Grasset de Saint-Sauveur mg 8526.jpg|thumb|upright|Slave traders in [[Gorée]], 18th century]]
European missionaries introduced Christianity to Senegal and the [[Casamance]] in the 19th century. It was only in the 1850s that the French began to expand onto the Senegalese mainland after they abolished slavery and began promoting an [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] doctrine,<ref>"[http://www.ohio.edu/chastain/rz/senegal.htm Senegal in 1848]" by Bruce Vandervort.</ref> adding native kingdoms like the Waalo, Cayor, Baol, and Jolof Empire.

===Independence (1960)===
On 4 April 1959 Senegal and the [[French Sudan]] merged to form the [[Mali Federation]], which became fully independent on 20 June 1960, as a result of a transfer of power agreement signed with France on 4 April 1960. Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) each proclaimed independence.

[[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] was Senegal's first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet and philosopher who personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, "Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism.<ref>''A Critical bibliography of French literature: in three parts. The Twentieth.'' Edited by David Clark Cabeen, Richard A. Brooks, Douglas W. Alden</ref>

[[File:Colonial Saint Louis.jpg|thumb|Colonial [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint Louis]] c. 1900. Europeans and Africans on the Rue Lebon.]] 
In 1980, President Senghor decided to retire from politics. The next year, he transferred power in 1981 to his hand-picked successor, [[Abdou Diouf]]. Former prime minister [[Mamadou Dia]], who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.

In the 1980s, [[Boubacar Lam]] discovered Senegalese oral history that was initially compiled by the [[Toucouleur people|Tuculor]] noble, [[Yoro Dyâo]], not long after [[World War I]], which documented migrations into [[West Africa]] from the [[Nile Valley]]; ethnic groups, from the [[Senegal River]] to the [[Niger Delta]], retained traditions of having an eastern origin.<ref name="AfrAm">{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Jane |title=A Companion to African-American Studies |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODmpx1fgJNIC&pg=PA463|isbn=978-1-4051-5466-6}}</ref>

Senegal joined with [[the Gambia]] to form the nominal [[Senegambia Confederation]] on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group ([[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] or MFDC) in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the [[Casamance conflict]]. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President [[Macky Sall]] held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.<ref>[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=135&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# "[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]: Senegal: Casamance, In-depth Developments since 2005"], ''Conflict Encyclopedia''</ref>

Abdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.

In the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet yielded a resolution.

==Politics==
[[File:Macky Sall - 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Macky Sall]], President of Senegal (2012–present)]]
[[File:Abdoulaye Wade in 16-05-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdoulaye Wade]], President of Senegal (2000–2012)]]

Senegal is a [[republic]] with a presidency; the president is [[Elections in Senegal|elected]] every five years as of 2001, previously being seven years, by adult voters. The first president, [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the ''Académie française''. Senegal's second president, [[Abdou Diouf]], later served as general secretary of the ''Organisation de la Francophonie''. The third president was [[Abdoulaye Wade]], a lawyer. The current president is [[Macky Sall]], elected in March 2012.

Senegal has more than 80 political parties. The [[unicameral]] parliament consists of the [[National Assembly of Senegal|National Assembly]], which has 150&nbsp;seats (a [[Senate (Senegal)|Senate]] was in place from 1999 to 2001 and 2007 to 2012).<ref name=cia>{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=CIA |work=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Senegal |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html |year=2009|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> An independent judiciary also exists in Senegal. The nation's highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council and the court of justice, members of which are named by the president.

===Political culture===
Currently, Senegal has a quasi-democratic political culture, one of the more successful post-colonial democratic transitions in Africa. Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. [[Marabout]]s, religious leaders of the various [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency. In 2009, [[Freedom House]] downgraded Senegal's status from "Free" to "Partially Free", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive. However, it has since recovered its Free status by 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/senegal-0#.VEWVY_nF-So|title=Senegal - Country report - Freedom in the World - 2014|website=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>

In 2008, Senegal finished in 12th position on the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]].<ref name="ibrahim_index">{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/section/the-ibrahim-index |title=The Ibrahim Index » Mo Ibrahim Foundation |publisher=Moibrahimfoundation.org |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229141051/http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/section/the-ibrahim-index |archivedate=29 December 2011 }}</ref> The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance (limited to [[sub-Saharan Africa]] until 2008), based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to their citizens. When the Northern African countries were added to the index in 2009, Senegal's 2008 position was retroactively downgraded to 15th place (with Tunisia, Egypt and Morocco placing themselves ahead of Senegal). {{As of|2012}}, Senegal's rank in the Ibrahim Index has decreased another point to 16 out of 52 African countries.

On 22 February 2011, Senegal reportedly severed diplomatic ties with [[Iran]], saying it supplied rebels with weapons which killed Senegalese troops in the [[Casamance conflict]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2011/02/201122392022223897.html |title=Senegal severs ties with Iran: Senegal's foreign ministry accuses Tehran of supplying weapons to separatist rebels in its southern Casamance region|date=23 February 2011|publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref>

The [[Senegalese presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]] was controversial due to President Wade's candidacy, as the opposition argued he should not be considered eligible to run again. Several youth opposition movements, including M23 and [[Y'en a Marre]], emerged in June 2011. In the end, Macky Sall of the [[Alliance for the Republic (Senegal)|Alliance for the Republic]] won, and Wade conceded the election to Sall. This peaceful and democratic transition was hailed by many foreign observers, such as the [[European Union|EU]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://world.myjoyonline.com/pages/africa/201203/83756.php |title=Macky Sall Senegal election win 'example for Africa' &#124; Africa |publisher=World.myjoyonline.com |date=26 August 2012 |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509000049/http://world.myjoyonline.com/pages/africa/201203/83756.php |archivedate=9 May 2013  }}</ref> as a show of "maturity".

On 19 September 2012, lawmakers voted to do away with the Senate to save an estimated $15 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=SENEGAL VOTES TO DO AWAY WITH SENATE TO SAVE MONEY|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/senegal-votes-do-away-senate-save-money|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref>

===Administrative divisions===

===Foreign relations===
{{Further|Foreign relations of Senegal}}

Senegal has a high profile in many international organizations and was a member of the [[UN Security Council]] in 1988–89 and 2015–2016. It was elected to the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] in 1997. Friendly to the West, especially to France and to the [[United States]], Senegal also is a vigorous proponent of more assistance from developed countries to the [[Third World]].

Senegal enjoys mostly cordial relations with its neighbors. In spite of clear progress on other fronts with [[Mauritania]] (border security, resource management, economic integration, etc.), an estimated 35,000 Mauritanian refugees (of the estimated 40,000 who were expelled from their home country in 1989) remain in Senegal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/video/africa/2014/05/mauritanian-refugees-refuse-leave-senegal-20145872721336117.html|title=Mauritanian refugees refuse to leave Senegal|date=8 May 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref>

Senegal is part of the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS). Integrated with the main bodies of the international community, Senegal is also a member of the [[African Union]] (AU) and the [[Community of Sahel-Saharan States]].

===Military===
[[File:Landmine warning sign near Ziguinchor, Senegal.jpg|thumb|Land mines were widely used in the [[Casamance conflict]] between separatist rebels and the central government.]]
The Senegalese armed forces consist of about 19,000 personnel in the army, [[Senegalese Air Force|air force]], navy, and gendarmerie. The Senegalese military force receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States. Germany also provides support but on a smaller scale.

Military noninterference in political affairs has contributed to Senegal's stability since independence. Senegal has participated in many international and regional peacekeeping missions. Most recently, in 2000, Senegal sent a battalion to the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] to participate in [[MONUC]], the [[United Nations]] peacekeeping mission, and agreed to deploy a United States-trained battalion to [[Sierra Leone]] to participate in [[UNAMSIL]], another UN peacekeeping mission.

In 2015, Senegal participated in the Saudi Arabian-led [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|military intervention in Yemen]] against the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Houthis]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Senegal to send 2,100 troops to join Saudi-led alliance|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/04/us-yemen-saudi-senegal-idUSKBN0NP1N920150504|date=4 May 2015|agency=Reuters}}</ref>

To fight corruption, the government has created the National Anti-Corruption Office (OFNAC) and the Commission of Restitution and Recovery of Illegally Acquired Assets. According to Business Anti-Corruption Portal, President Sall created the OFNAC to replace the Commission Nationale de Lutte Contre la non Transparence, la Corruption et la Concussion (CNLCC). It is said that the OFNAC represents a more effective tool for fighting corruption than the CNLCC established under former President Wade.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Anti-Corruption Initiatives|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/senegal/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=27 March 2014}}</ref> The mission of OFNAC is to fight corruption, embezzlement of public funds and fraud.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Senegal}}
[[File:Senegal map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Senegal map of Köppen climate classification]]
[[File:Casamance landscape.jpg|thumb|Landscape of [[Casamance]]]]
Senegal is located on the west of the African continent. It lies between latitudes [[12th parallel north|12°]] and [[17th parallel north|17°N]], and longitudes [[11th meridian west|11°]] and [[18th meridian west|18°W]].

Senegal is externally bounded by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, [[Mauritania]] to the north, [[Mali]] to the east, and [[Guinea]] and [[Guinea-Bissau]] to the south; internally it almost completely surrounds [[The Gambia]], namely on the north, east and south, except for Gambia's short Atlantic coastline.

The Senegalese landscape consists mainly of the rolling sandy plains of the western [[Sahel]] which rise to foothills in the southeast. Here is also found Senegal's highest point, an otherwise unnamed feature 2.7&nbsp;km southeast of [[Nepen Diakha]] at {{convert|648|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=11080|title=Senegal High Point|publisher=[[SRTM]]}}</ref>  The northern border is formed by the [[Senegal River]]; other rivers include the [[Gambia River|Gambia]] and [[Casamance River]]s. The capital Dakar lies on the [[Cap-Vert]] peninsula, the westernmost point of continental Africa.

The [[Cape Verde]] islands lie some {{convert|560|km}} off the Senegalese coast, but Cap-Vert ("Cape Green") is a maritime placemark, set at the foot of "Les Mammelles", a {{convert|105|m|ft|0|adj=on}} cliff resting at one end of the Cap-Vert peninsula onto which is settled Senegal's capital Dakar, and {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} south of the "Pointe des Almadies", the westernmost point in Africa.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Senegal}}
[[File:Ngor Beach.jpg|thumb|Beach at N'Gor]]
Senegal has a [[tropical climate]] with pleasant heat throughout the year with well-defined dry and humid seasons that result from northeast winter winds and southwest summer winds. The dry season (December to April) is dominated by hot, dry, [[harmattan]] wind.<ref name=cia/>
Dakar's annual rainfall of about {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=on}} occurs between June and October when maximum temperatures average {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}} and minimums {{convert|24.2|°C|°F|1}}; December to February maximum temperatures average {{convert|25.7|°C|°F|1}} and minimums {{convert|18|°C|°F|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.senegal.climatemps.com/|title=Dakar, Senegal Climate Information&nbsp;– ClimateTemp.info, Making Sense of Average Monthly Weather & Temperature Data with Detailed Climate Graphs That Portray Average Rainfall & Sunshine Hours |publisher=ClimaTemps.com |date=22 July 2011 |accessdate=29 March 2012}}</ref>

Interior temperatures are higher than along the coast (for example, average daily temperatures in Kaolack and Tambacounda for May are {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}} and {{convert|32.7|°C|°F|1}} respectively, compared to Dakar's {{convert|23.2|°C|°F|1}} ),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldclimate.com/|title=Weather rainfall and temperature data |publisher=World Climate}}</ref> and rainfall increases substantially farther south, exceeding {{convert|1500|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} annually in some areas.

In Tambacounda in the far interior, particularly on the border of Mali where desert begins, temperatures can reach as high as {{convert|54|°C|°F|1}}. The northernmost part of the country has a near [[hot desert climate]], the central part has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] and the southernmost part has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]]. Senegal is mainly a sunny and dry country.

{{Main|Economy of Senegal}}
[[File:Senegal Export Treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Senegal's exports]]

After its economy contracted by 2.1% in 1993, Senegal instituted a major economic reform program with the support of international donors. This reform began with a 50 percent devaluation of the country's currency (the [[CFAF|CFA franc]]). Government price controls and subsidies were also dismantled. As a result, Senegal's inflation went down, investment went up, and the gross domestic product rose approximately 5% a year between 1995 and 2001.<ref name=cia/>

The main industries include [[food processing]], [[mining]], cement, [[artificial fertilizer]], [[chemical industry|chemicals]], [[textile industry|textiles]], [[refining]] imported petroleum, and [[Tourism in Senegal|tourism]]. Exports include fish, chemicals, cotton, fabrics, [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], and [[calcium phosphate]]. The principal foreign market is India with 26.7% of exports (as of 1998). Other foreign markets include the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom.

[[File:20130513-DSC 8564 (8750149526).jpg|thumb|Fishing boats in Dakar]]
Senegal has a {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|adj=on}} exclusive fishing zone that has been regularly breached in recent years ({{As of|2014|lc=y}}). It has been estimated that the country's fishermen lose 300,000 tonnes of fish each year to [[illegal fishing]]. The Senegalese government have tried to control the illegal fishing which is conducted by [[fishing trawlers]], some of which are registered in [[Russia]], [[Mauritania]], [[Belize]] and [[Ukraine]]. In January 2014, a Russian trawler, ''Oleg Naydenov'', was seized by Senegalese authorities close to the maritime border with [[Guinea-Bissau]].<ref>'Russia says factory ship was seized on Greenpeace's orders; Trawler held by Senegal over alleged illegal fishing' by John Vidal The Guardian (UK newspaper) 10 January 2014 page 23</ref>

As a member of the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]] (WAEMU), Senegal is working toward greater regional integration with a unified external [[tariff]]. Senegal is also a member of the [[OHADA|Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa]].<ref name="ohada.com">

Senegal achieved full Internet connectivity in 1996, creating a mini-boom in information technology-based services. Private activity now accounts for 82 percent of its GDP. On the negative side, Senegal faces deep-seated urban problems of chronic high unemployment, [[Income disparity|socioeconomic disparity]], [[juvenile delinquency]], and drug addiction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hellochina/helloSenegal2009/2009-09/01/content_8643211.htm|title=Economy of Senegal|website=www.chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>

Senegal is a major recipient of international development assistance. Donors include the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID), Japan, France and China.

Senegal has a population of around {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Senegal}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}}&nbsp;million{{UN_Population|ref}}, about 42 percent of whom live in rural areas. Density in these areas varies from about {{convert|77|PD/km2}} in the west-central region to {{convert|2|/km2}} in the arid eastern section.

===Ethnic groups===
{{Main|Ethnic groups in Senegal}}

Senegal has a wide variety of [[ethnic group]]s and, as in most West African countries, several languages are widely spoken. The [[Wolof people|Wolof]] are the largest single ethnic group in Senegal at 43 percent; the [[Fula people|Fula]]<ref>{{lang-fr|link=no|Peul}}; {{lang-ff|Fulɓe}}</ref> and [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] (also known as [[Halpulaar]]'en, literally "[[Pulaar]]-speakers") (24%) are the second biggest group, followed by the [[Serer people|Serer]] (14.7%),<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ga.html Gambia].

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Senegal}}French is the [[official language]], spoken at least by all those who enjoyed several years in the educational system that is of French origin (Koranic schools are even more popular, but Arabic is not widely spoken outside of the context of recitation). Most people also speak their own ethnic language while, especially in Dakar, [[Wolof language|Wolof]] is the [[lingua franca]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Wolof|author=National African Language Research Center|publisher=University of Wisconsin |location=Madison}}</ref> [[Pulaar]] is spoken by the Fulas and Toucouleur. The [[Serer language]] is widely spoken by both Serers and non-Serers (including President Sall, whose wife is Serer); so are the [[Cangin languages]], whose speakers are ethnically Serers. [[Jola languages]] are widely spoken in the [[Casamance]].

Several of the Senegalese languages have the legal status of "[[national language]]s": [[Balanta-Ganja language|Balanta-Ganja]], [[Hassaniya Arabic]], [[Jola-Fonyi language|Jola-Fonyi]], [[Mandinka language|Mandinka]], [[Mandjak language|Mandjak]], [[Mankanya language|Mankanya]], [[Noon language|Noon]] (Serer-Noon), [[Pulaar language|Pulaar]], [[Serer language|Serer]], [[Soninke language|Soninke]], and [[Wolof language|Wolof]].

[[Portuguese Creole]], locally known as Portuguese, is a prominent minority language in [[Ziguinchor]], regional capital of the [[Casamance]], spoken by local Portuguese creoles and immigrants from Guinea-Bissau. The local Cape Verdean community speak a similar Portuguese creole, [[Cape Verdean Creole]], and standard Portuguese. Portuguese was introduced in Senegal's secondary education in 1961 in Dakar by the country's first president, [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]]. It is currently available in most of Senegal and in higher education. It is especially prevalent in Casamance as it relates with the local cultural identity.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/encarte/encarte98a.htm | title=A Língua Portuguesa no Senegal | date=12–25 April 2006 | accessdate=10 December 2014 | author=José Horta | publisher=Instituto Camões | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000233/http://www.instituto-camoes.pt/encarte/encarte98a.htm | archivedate=4 March 2016 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

{{main|Religion in Senegal}}

Senegal is a secular state.<ref name="Constitution of Senegal" /> [[Islam in Senegal|Islam]] is the predominant religion in the country, practiced by approximately 92% of the country's population; the Christian community, at 7% of the population, are mostly [[Roman Catholic]]s but there are still diverse [[Protestant]] denominations. One percent have [[animism|animist]] beliefs, particularly in the southeastern region of the country.<ref name=cia/> Some [[Serer people]] follow the [[Serer religion]].<ref>Conklin, Alice L.

[[File:Dakar cathedrale.jpg|thumb|The [[Dakar]] Cathedral]]
A majority of the Muslims in Senegal are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] with [[Sufi]] influences. Islamic communities in Senegal are generally organized around one of several Islamic [[Sufi]] orders or brotherhoods, headed by a ''[[khalif]]'' (''xaliifa'' in [[Wolof language|Wolof]], from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''khalīfa''), who is usually a direct descendant of the group's founder. The two largest and most prominent Sufi orders in Senegal are the [[Tijaniyya]], whose largest sub-groups are based in the cities of [[Tivaouane]] and [[Kaolack]], and the [[Mouride|Murīdiyya (Murid)]], based in the city of [[Touba, Senegal|Touba]]. 27% are [[nondenominational Muslims]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/|title=Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation|date=9 August 2012|website=Pewforum.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>

The [[Halpulaar]] ([[Pulaar]]-speakers), composed of [[Fula people]], a widespread group found along the Sahel from Chad to Senegal, and ''[[Toucouleur people|Toucouleurs]]'', represent 23.8 percent of the population.<ref name=cia/> Historically, they were the first to become Muslim. Many of the ''Toucouleurs'', or sedentary Halpulaar of the Senegal River Valley in the north, converted to Islam around a millennium ago and later contributed to Islam's propagation throughout Senegal. Success was gained among the Wolofs, but repulsed by the Serers.

Most communities south of the Senegal River Valley, however, were not thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamized]]. The Serer people stood out as one of this group, who spent over one thousand years resisting Islamization (see [[Serer history (medieval era to present)|Serer history]]). Although many Serers are Christians or Muslim, their conversion to Islam in particular is very recent, who converted on their own free will rather than by force, although force had been tried centuries earlier unsuccessfully (see [[the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]]).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hans Bressers|author2=Walter A. Rosenbaum|title=Achieving Sustainable Development: The Challenge of Governance Across Social Scales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SvAGAeQNo7oC&pg=PA151|year=2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97802-0|pages=151–}}</ref>

The spread of formal Quranic school (called ''daara'' in Wolof) during the colonial period increased largely through the effort of the Tidjâniyya. In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term ''daara'' often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older Qādiriyya order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can. Some of them continue their religious studies at councils (''majlis'') or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.

Small Roman Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal Serer, [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Mankanya people|Mankanya]] and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved. In Dakar Catholic and Protestant rites are practiced by the Lebanese, Cape Verdean, European, and American immigrant populations, and among certain Africans of other countries as well as by the Senegalese themselves. Although Islam is Senegal's majority religion, Senegal's first president, [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], was a Catholic Serer.

[[Serer religion]] encompasses a belief in a supreme deity called [[Roog]] ([[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]), [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]], [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]] and [[divination]] ceremonies such as the annual ''Xoy'' (or ''Khoye'') ceremony precided over by the Serer [[Saltigue]]s (high priests and priestesses). [[Senegambia]]n (both Senegal and [[the Gambia]]) Muslim festivals such as ''Tobaski'', ''Gamo'', ''Koriteh'', ''Weri Kor'', etc., [[Serer religion#Influence in Senegambia|are all borrowed words from the Serer religion]].<ref name="N.Diouf"/> They were ancient Serer festivals rooted in Serer religion, not Islam.<ref name="N.Diouf">Diouf, Niokhobaye, « Chronique du royaume du Sine, suivie de Notes sur les traditions orales et les sources écrites concernant le [[Kingdom of Sine|royaume du Sine]] par Charles Becker et Victor Martin (1972)», .

==Culture==

Senegal is well known for the West African tradition of storytelling, which is done by ''[[griot]]s'', who have kept West African history alive for thousands of years through words and music. The ''griot'' profession is passed down generation to generation and requires years of training and apprenticeship in genealogy, history and music. ''Griots'' give voice to generations of West African society.<ref name="ross">Eric S. Ross, Culture and Customs of Senegal, Greenwood Press, Westport, CT, 2008 {{ISBN|0-313-34036-6}}</ref>

The [[African Renaissance Monument]] built in 2010 in [[Dakar]] is the [[List of statues by height|tallest statue in Africa]]. Dakar also hosts a film festival, Recidak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://fr.africatime.com/senegal/articles/apres-dix-annees-dinterruption-les-recidak-nouvelles-arrivent-en-2014|title=Après dix années d'interruption : Les RECIDAK nouvelles arrivent en 2014|author=Baba Diop|language=fr|publisher=Africatime|accessdate=30 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130190636/http://fr.africatime.com/senegal/articles/apres-dix-annees-dinterruption-les-recidak-nouvelles-arrivent-en-2014|archivedate=30 November 2016|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Further|Senegalese cuisine}}
Because Senegal borders the [[Atlantic Ocean]], [[Fish as food|fish]] is very important. [[Chicken as food|Chicken]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[pea]]s, [[Egg (food)|eggs]], and [[beef]] are also used in Senegalese cooking, but not [[pork]], due to the nation's largely [[Muslim]] population. [[Peanut]]s, the primary crop of Senegal, as well as [[couscous]], [[white rice]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[lentil]]s, [[black-eyed pea]]s and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes. Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.

Popular fresh juices are made from [[Hibiscus|bissap]], [[ginger]], ''buy'' (pronounced 'buoy', which is the fruit of the [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] tree, also known as "monkey bread fruit"), [[mango]], or other fruit or wild trees (most famously [[soursop]], which is called ''corossol'' in French). Desserts are very rich and sweet, combining native ingredients with the extravagance and style characteristic of the French impact on Senegal's culinary methods. They are often served with fresh fruit and are traditionally followed by [[coffee]] or [[tea]].

===Music===

===Hospitality===
Hospitality, in theory, is given such importance in Senegalese culture that it is widely considered to be part of the national identity.

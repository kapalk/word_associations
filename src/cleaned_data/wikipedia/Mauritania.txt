'''Mauritania''' is a country in [[Northwest Africa]]. It is the eleventh largest [[sovereign state]] in [[Africa]] and is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, [[Western Sahara]] to the north and northwest, [[Algeria]] to the northeast, [[Mali]] to the east and southeast, and [[Senegal]] to the southwest.

The country derives its name from the ancient [[Berbers|Berber]] kingdom of [[Mauretania]], which existed from the 3rd century BCE into the 7th century CE in the far north of modern-day [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]. Approximately 90% of Mauritania's land is within the [[Sahara]]; consequently, the population is concentrated in the south, where precipitation is slightly higher. The capital and largest city is [[Nouakchott]], located on the Atlantic coast, which is home to around one-third of the country's {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Mauritania}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people. The government was overthrown on 6 August 2008, in [[2008 Mauritanian coup d'état|a military coup d'état]] led by General [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]]. On 16 April 2009, Aziz resigned from the military to run for president in the 19 July elections, which he won.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/africa/20mauritania.html?_r=0|title=Coup Leader Wins Election Amid Outcry in Mauritania|agency=[[Associated Press]] (AP)|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=19 July 2009|location= Nouakchott, Mauritania |accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref>

==History and politics==
{{main|History of Mauritania|Politics of Mauritania}}

===Ancient history===
The ancient tribes of Mauritania were Berber people. The [[Bafour]]s were primarily agricultural, and among the first Saharan people to abandon their historically nomadic lifestyle. With the gradual desiccation of the Sahara, they headed south.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Many of the Berber tribes claimed Yemeni (and sometimes other Arab) origins. There is little evidence to support such claims, but a 2000 [[DNA]] study of Yemeni people suggested there might be some ancient connection between the peoples.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chaabani, H.|author2=Sanchez-Mazas, A.|author3=Sallami SF|year=2000|title=Genetic differentiation of Yemeni people according to rhesus and Gm polymorphisms|journal=Annales de Génétique|volume=43|issue=3–4 |pages=155–62|pmid=11164198|doi=10.1016/S0003-3995(00)01023-6}}</ref>

Other peoples also migrated south past the Sahara to West Africa. In 1076, Moorish Islamic warrior monks ([[Almoravid]] or Al Murabitun) attacked and conquered the large area of the ancient [[Ghana Empire]]. [[File:AMH-6743-NA View of Arguin castle.jpg|thumb|The [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] trading post of [[Arguin]] in 1665]]

The [[Char Bouba war]] (1644–74) was the unsuccessful final effort of the peoples to repel the [[Yemen]]i [[Maqil]] Arab invaders. The invaders were led by the [[Beni Hassan]] tribe. The descendants of the Beni Hassan warriors became the [[hassane|upper stratum]] of [[Moors|Moorish]] society. [[Hassaniya]], a bedouin [[Arabic dialect]] that derives its name from the Beni Hassan, became the dominant language among the largely [[nomad]]ic population.<ref name="countrystudies">"[http://countrystudies.us/mauritania/3.htm Mauritania - History]". Library of Congress Country Studies.</ref>

Berbers retained a niche influence by producing the majority of the region's [[marabout]]s: those who preserve and teach Islamic tradition.<ref name="countrystudies"/>

===Colonial history and present day===
{{Main|Colonial Mauritania}}
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}
[[French colonial empire|Imperial France]]{{vague|date=February 2016}} gradually [[Franco-Trarzan War of 1825|absorbed the territories]] of present-day Mauritania from the [[Senegal River]] area and northwards, starting in the late 19th century. In 1901, [[Xavier Coppolani]] took charge of the imperial mission. Through a combination of strategic alliances with [[Zawaya tribe|Zawaya]] tribes, and military pressure on the Hassane warrior nomads, he managed to extend French rule over the Mauritanian [[emirate]]s. [[Emirate of Trarza|Trarza]], [[Brakna]] and [[Tagant Region|Tagant]] were occupied by the French armies in 1903–04, but the northern emirate of [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] held out longer, aided by the anti-colonial rebellion (or [[jihad]]) of shaykh [[Maa al-Aynayn]], as well by insurgents from Tagant and the other regions. Adrar was finally defeated militarily in 1912, and incorporated into the territory of Mauritania, which had been drawn up and planned in 1904. Mauritania was part of [[French West Africa]] from 1920, as a [[protectorate]] and, then, a [[colony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/world/mauritania-history.html|title=Mauritania: History|website=www.infoplease.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>

French rule brought legal prohibitions against slavery and an end to inter-clan warfare. During the colonial period, 90% of the population remained nomadic. Many sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to trickle back into Mauritania. The previous capital of the country under the French rule, [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], was located in Senegal, so when the country gained independence in 1960, Nouakchott, at the time little more than a fortified village (''"ksar"''), was chosen as the site of the  new capital of Mauritania.<ref name="Pazzanita2008">{{cite book|author=Pazzanita, Anthony G. |title=Historical Dictionary of Mauritania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KU_9MfXKKYC&pg=PA369|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-6265-4}} page 369.</ref>

After gaining independence, larger numbers of indigenous [[Sub-Saharan African]] peoples ([[Fula people|Haalpulaar]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], and [[Wolof people|Wolof]]) entered Mauritania, moving into the area north of the [[Senegal River]]. Educated in French language and customs, many of these recent arrivals became clerks, soldiers, and administrators in the new state. This occurred as the French militarily suppressed the most intransigent Hassane tribes in the north. This changed the former balance of power, and new conflicts arose between the southern populations and Moors. Between these groups stood African origins, who is part of the Arab society, integrated into a low-caste social position.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6938032.stm "Mauritanian MPs pass slavery law"], BBC News. 9 August 2007.</ref>

[[File:Central mosque in Nouakchott.jpg|thumb|[[Nouakchott]] is the capital and the largest city of Mauritania. It is one of the largest cities in the [[Sahara]].]]

The great [[Sahel drought]]s of the early 1970s caused massive devastation in Mauritania, exacerbating problems of poverty and conflict. The Arabized dominant elites reacted to changing circumstances, and to [[Arab nationalist]] calls from abroad, by increasing pressure to [[Arabization|Arabize]] many aspects of Mauritanian life, such as law and the education system. This was also a reaction to the consequences of the French domination under the colonial rule. Various models for maintaining the country's cultural diversity have been suggested, but none were successfully implemented.

This ethnic discord was evident during inter-communal violence that broke out in April 1989 (the "[[Mauritania–Senegal Border War]]"), but has since subsided. Mauritania expelled some 70,000 sub-Saharan African Mauritanians in the late 1980s.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 MAURITANIA: Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance], IRIN News. 5 March 2007.</ref> Ethnic tensions and the sensitive issue of slavery –&nbsp;past and, in some areas, present&nbsp;– are still powerful themes in the country's political debate. A significant number from all groups seek a more diverse, pluralistic society.

===Issue of Western Sahara===
{{main|Status of Western Sahara|Tiris al-Gharbiyya}}
The [[International Court of Justice]] has concluded that in spite of some evidence of both Morocco's and Mauritania's legal ties prior to Spanish colonization, neither set of ties were sufficient to affect the application of the UN General Assembly [[Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples]] to [[Western Sahara]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?sum=323&p1=3&p2=4&case=61&p3=5|title=Cour internationale de Justice - International Court of Justice|website=www.icj-cij.org}}</ref>

Mauritania, along with [[Morocco]], annexed the territory of [[Western Sahara]] in 1976, with Mauritania taking the lower one-third at the request of Spain, a former imperial power. After several military losses from the [[Polisario]] –&nbsp;heavily armed and supported by Algeria, the [[regional power]] and rival to Morocco&nbsp;– Mauritania withdrew in 1979. Its claims were taken over by Morocco.

Due to economic weakness, Mauritania has been a negligible player in the territorial dispute, with its official position being that it wishes for an expedient solution that is mutually agreeable to all parties. While most of Western Sahara has been occupied by Morocco, the UN still considers the Western Sahara a territory that needs to express its wishes with respect to statehood. A referendum is still supposed to be held sometime in the future, under UN auspices, to determine whether or not the indigenous [[Sahrawis]] wish to be independent, as the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], or to be part of Morocco.

===Ould Daddah era (1960–1978)===
{{Main|Constitution of Mauritania|Mauritanian People's Party|Moktar Ould Daddah}}
<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
Mauritania became an independent nation in November 1960.<ref>{{citation|first= Martin |last= Meredith |title= The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence|publisher= Public Affairs Publishing|location= New York|year= 2005|page= 69|isbn=978-1610390712}}</ref> In 1964 [[President of Mauritania|President]] [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], originally installed by the French, formalized Mauritania as a [[one-party state]] with a new [[Constitution of Mauritania|constitution]], setting up an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] presidential regime. Daddah's own [[Parti du Peuple Mauritanien]] (PPM) became the ruling organization in a [[One-party state|one-party system]]. The President justified this on the grounds that Mauritania was not ready for western-style [[multi-party system|multi-party democracy]]. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was reelected in uncontested elections in 1976 and 1978.

He was ousted in a [[Military Committee for National Recovery|bloodless coup]] on 10 July 1978. He had brought the country to near-collapse through a disastrous [[History of Western Sahara|war]] to [[annexation|annex]] the [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|southern part]] of [[Western Sahara]], framed as an attempt to create a "[[Greater Mauritania]]".

===CMRN and CMSN military governments (1978–1984)===
[[File:Chinguetti-Guide.JPG|thumb|[[Chinguetti]] was a center of Islamic scholarship in West Africa.]]
[[Col.]] [[Mustafa Ould Salek]]'s [[CMRN]] [[military junta|''junta'']] proved incapable of either establishing a strong base of power or extracting the country from its destabilizing conflict with the [[Western Sahara|Sahrawi]] resistance movement, the [[Polisario Front]]. It quickly fell, to be replaced by another military government, the [[Military Committee for National Salvation|CMSN]].

The energetic Colonel [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah]] soon emerged as its strongman. By giving up all claims to Western Sahara, he found peace with the Polisario and improved relations with its main backer, Algeria. But relations with Morocco, the other party to the conflict, and its European ally France deteriorated. Instability continued, and Haidallah's ambitious reform attempts foundered. His regime was plagued by attempted coups and intrigue within the military establishment. It became increasingly contested due to his harsh and uncompromising measures against opponents; many dissidents were jailed, and some executed. In 1981 slavery was formally abolished by law, making Mauritania the last country in the world to do so.

===Ould Taya's rule (1984–2005)===
In December 1984, Haidallah was deposed by Colonel [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]], who, while retaining tight military control, relaxed the political climate. Ould Taya moderated Mauritania's previous pro-Algerian stance, and re-established ties with Morocco during the late 1980s. He deepened these ties during the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of Mauritania's drive to attract support from Western states and Western-aligned Arab states. Mauritania has not rescinded its recognition of Polisario's Western Saharan exile government, and remains on good terms with Algeria. Its position on the Western Sahara conflict is, since the 1980s, one of strict neutrality.

Ordinance 83.127, enacted 5 June 1983, started the process of nationalization of all land not clearly the property of a documented owner, thus abolishing the traditional system of land tenure. Potential nationalization was based on the concept of "dead land",<ref>Ordonnance 9</ref> i.e., property which has not been developed or on which obvious development cannot be seen. A practical effect was government seizure of traditional communal grazing lands.<ref name=MCT>{{cite web|url= https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/MAURITAN944.PDF |title= Mauritania's campaign of terror, State-Sponsored Repression of Black Africans|publisher= Human Rights Watch/Africa (formerly Africa Watch)|year= 1994}}</ref>{{rp|42, 60}}

[[List of political parties in Mauritania|Political parties]], illegal during the military period, were legalized again in 1991. By April 1992, as civilian rule returned, 16 major political parties had been recognized; 12 major political parties were active in 2004. The ''[[Parti Républicain Démocratique et Social]]'' (PRDS), formerly led by President Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, dominated Mauritanian politics after the country's first multi-party elections in April 1992, following the approval by [[referendum]] of the current constitution in July 1991. President Taya won elections in 1992 and 1997. Most opposition parties boycotted the first legislative election in 1992. For nearly a decade the parliament was dominated by the PRDS. The opposition participated in municipal elections in January–February 1994, and in subsequent [[Senate]] elections – most recently in April 2004 – and gained representation at the local level, as well as three seats in the Senate.

This period was marked by extensive ethnic violence and [[Human rights in Mauritania|human rights abuses]]. Between 1990 and 1991, a campaign of particularly extreme violence took place against a background of [[Arabization]], interference with blacks' association rights, expropriation and expatriation.<ref>''Amnesty International Report 1990,'' London, Amnesty International Publications, 1990</ref>

Following the incident, several riots erupted in [[Bakel, Senegal|Bakel]], [[Dakar]] and other towns in Senegal, directed against the mainly Arabized Mauritanians who dominated the local retail business. The rioting, adding to already existing tensions, led to a campaign of terror against black Mauritanians,<ref>{{cite book|first= Mireille |last= Duteil|language= French|chapter= Chronique mauritanienne |title= Annuaire de l'Afrique du Nord|volume= XXVIII|year= 1989 |edition= du CNRS}}</ref> who are often seen as 'Senegalese' by Bidha'an, regardless of their nationality. As low scale conflict with Senegal continued into 1990/91, the Mauritanian government engaged in or encouraged acts of violence and seizures of property directed against the Halpularen ethnic group. The tension culminated in an international airlift agreed to by Senegal and Mauritania under international pressure to prevent further violence. The Mauritanian Government expelled tens of thousands of black Mauritanians. Most of these so-called 'Senegalese' had no ties to Senegal, and many have been repatriated from Senegal and Mali after 2007.<ref name="sy"/> The exact number of expulsions is not known but the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimates that, as of June 1991, 52,995 Mauritanian refugees were living in Senegal and at least 13,000 in Mali.<ref name=MCT/>{{rp|27}}

In the late 1980s, Ould Taya had established close co-operation with [[Iraq]], and pursued a strongly [[Arab nationalist]] line. Mauritania grew increasingly isolated internationally, and tensions with Western countries grew dramatically after it took a pro-Iraqi position during the [[1991 Gulf War]]. During the mid-to late 1990s, Mauritania shifted its foreign policy to one of increased co-operation with the US and Europe. It was rewarded with diplomatic normalization and aid projects. On 28 October 1999, Mauritania joined Egypt, Palestine, and Jordan as the only members of the Arab League to officially recognize Israel. Ould Taya also started co-operating with the United States in anti-terrorism activities, a policy which was criticized by some human rights organizations.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/11/23/backlash.forusally.ap/ |title=Crackdown courts U.S. approval |publisher=CNN |date=24 November 2003 |accessdate=6 August 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080407090221/http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/11/23/backlash.forusally.ap/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 7 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.asp?ReportID=47093 |title=Mauritania: New wave of arrests presented as crackdown on Islamic extremists |publisher=IRIN Africa |date=12 May 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2008}}</ref> (See also [[Foreign relations of Mauritania]].)

A group of current and former Army officers launched a violent and unsuccessful coup attempt on 8 June 2003. The leaders of the attempted coup escaped from the country, but some of them were caught, later on. Mauritania's [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2003|presidential election]], its third since adopting the democratic process in 1992, took place on 7 November 2003. Six candidates, including Mauritania's first female and first Haratine (descended from former [[Slavery in Mauritania|slaves]]) candidates, represented a wide variety of political goals and backgrounds. Incumbent President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]] won reelection with 67.0% of the popular vote, according to the official figures, with [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla]] finishing second.

===August 2005 military coup===
<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
On 3 August 2005, a military coup led by Colonel [[Ely Ould Mohamed Vall]] ended Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's twenty-one years of rule. Taking advantage of Taya's attendance at the funeral of [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] [[King Fahd]], the military, including members of the presidential guard, seized control of key points in the capital [[Nouakchott]]. The coup proceeded without loss of life. Calling themselves the Military Council for Justice and Democracy, the officers released the following statement:

:"The national armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority, which our people have suffered from during the past years."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4741243.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Mauritania officers 'seize power' |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2008}}</ref>

The Military Council later issued another statement naming Colonel Vall as president and director of the national police force, the ''Sûreté Nationale''. Vall, once regarded as a firm ally of the now-ousted president, had aided Taya in the coup that had originally brought him to power, and had later served as his security chief. Sixteen other officers were listed as members of the Council.

Though cautiously watched by the international community, the coup came to be generally accepted, with the military ''junta'' organizing elections within a promised two-year timeline. In a [[referendum]] on 26 June 2006, Mauritanians overwhelmingly (97%) approved a new constitution which limited the duration of a president's stay in office. The leader of the ''junta'', Col. Vall, promised to abide by the referendum and relinquish power peacefully. Mauritania's establishment of relations with [[Israel]]{{spaced ndash}}it is one of only three Arab states to recognize Israel{{spaced ndash}}was maintained by the new regime, despite widespread criticism from the opposition. They considered that position as a legacy of the Taya regime's attempts to curry favor with the West.

Parliamentary and municipal elections in Mauritania took place on 19 November and 3 December 2006.

===2007 presidential elections===
[[File:Sidi Mohamed Ould Cheikh Abdallahi.jpg|thumb|[[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]]]]
Mauritania's first fully democratic presidential elections took place on 11 March 2007. The elections effected the final transfer from military to civilian rule following the military coup in 2005. This was the first time since Mauritania gained independence in 1960 that it elected a president in a multi-candidate election.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6440597.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Mauritania vote 'free and fair' |date=12 March 2007 |accessdate=6 August 2008}}</ref>

The elections were won in a second round of voting by [[Sidi Ould Cheikh Abdallahi]], with [[Ahmed Ould Daddah]] a close second.

===2008 military coup===
{{main|2008 Mauritanian coup d'état}}
On 6 August 2008, the head of the presidential guards took over the president's palace in Nouakchott, a day after 48 lawmakers from the ruling party resigned in protest of President Abdallahi's policies.{{Which|date=May 2013}} The army surrounded key government facilities, including the state television building, after the president fired senior officers, one of them the head of the presidential guards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=174725|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081206021204/http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=174725|archivedate=6 December 2008|title= 48 lawmakers resign from ruling party in Mauritania |work= [[Tehran Times]] |date=6 August 2008}}</ref> The President, Prime Minister [[Yahya Ould Ahmed Waghef]], and Mohamed Ould R'zeizim, Minister of Internal Affairs, were arrested.

The coup was co-ordinated by General [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]], former chief of staff of the Mauritanian Army and head of the presidential guard, who had recently been fired. Mauritania's presidential spokesman, Abdoulaye Mamadouba, said the President, Prime Minister, and Interior Minister had been arrested by renegade Senior Mauritanian army officers and were being held under house arrest at the presidential palace in the capital.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jOO7pbj1cpN3prZXm_VhJU6BcZlw |agency=AFP |title=Coup in Mauritania as president, PM arrested |publisher=Google |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809142214/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jOO7pbj1cpN3prZXm_VhJU6BcZlw |archivedate=9 August 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7544834.stm |title=Troops stage 'coup' in Mauritania |publisher=BBC News |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hmqqO8XJixmimcunkNvDYctnppTgD92CO0CO1 |title=Coup under way in Mauritania: president's office |accessdate=2008-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812090229/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hmqqO8XJixmimcunkNvDYctnppTgD92CO0CO1 |archivedate=12 August 2008 |df= }}. ap.google.com</ref> In the apparently successful and bloodless coup, Abdallahi's daughter, Amal Mint Cheikh Abdallahi, said: "The security agents of the BASEP (Presidential Security Battalion) came to our home and took away my father."<ref>{{cite news|last=McElroy |first=Damien |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/mauritania/2509991/Mauritania-president-under-house-arrest-as-army-stages-coup.html |title=Mauritania president under house arrest as army stages coup |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref> The coup plotters, all dismissed in a presidential decree shortly beforehand, included Abdel Aziz, General Muhammad Ould Al-Ghazwani, General Philippe Swikri, and Brigadier General (Aqid) Ahmad Ould Bakri.<ref>{{cite web |author=Vinsinfo |url=http://www.themedialine.org/news/news_detail.asp?NewsID=22334 |title=themedialine.org, Generals Seize Power in Mauritanian Coup |publisher=Themedialine.org |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>

===After the coup===

A Mauritanian lawmaker, Mohammed Al Mukhtar, claimed that many of the country's people supported the takeover of a government that had become "an authoritarian regime" under a president who had "marginalized the majority in parliament."<ref>Mohamed, Ahmed. {{cite web|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hmqqO8XJixmimcunkNvDYctnppTgD92CODDO0 |title=Renegade army officers stage coup in Mauritania |accessdate=2008-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819194326/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hmqqO8XJixmimcunkNvDYctnppTgD92CODDO0 |archivedate=19 August 2008 |df= }}. ap.google.com (6 August 2008)</ref> The coup was also backed by Abdallahi's rival in the 2007 election, Ahmed Ould Daddah. However, Abdel Aziz's regime was isolated internationally, and became subject to diplomatic sanctions and the cancellation of some aid projects. It found few supporters (among them Morocco, Libya and Iran), while Algeria, the United States, France and other European countries criticized the coup, and continued to refer to Abdallahi as the legitimate president of Mauritania. Domestically, a group of parties coalesced around Abdallahi to continue protesting the coup, which caused the junta to ban demonstrations and crack down on opposition activists. International and internal pressure eventually forced the release of Abdallahi, who was instead placed under house arrest in his home village. The new government broke off relations with Israel. In March 2010, Mauritania's female foreign minister Mint Hamdi Ould Mouknass announced that Mauritania had cut ties with Israel in a "complete and definitive way."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Mauritania-Affirms-Break-with-Israel-88763857.html |title=Mauritania Affirms Break with Israel |publisher=Voice of America News |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>

After the coup, Abdel Aziz insisted on holding new presidential elections to replace Abdallahi, but was forced to reschedule them due to internal and international opposition. During the spring of 2009, the [[Military junta|junta]] negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties. As a result, Abdallahi formally resigned under protest, as it became clear that some opposition forces had defected from him and most international players, notably including France and Algeria, now aligned with Abdel Aziz. The United States continued to criticize the coup, but did not actively oppose the elections.

Abdallahi's resignation allowed the [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2009|election]] of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority. Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. They argued that the election had been falsified due to junta control, and complained that the international community had let down the opposition. Despite complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with Mauritania. By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and internal support. Some figures, such as Senate chairman [[Messaoud Ould Boulkheir]], continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.

In February 2011, the waves of the [[Arab Spring]] [[2011–2013 Mauritanian protests|spread to Mauritania]], where thousands of people took to the streets of the capital.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/feb/25/gaddafi-libya-live-blog |location=London |work=The Guardian |first= Richard |last= Adams |title=Libya's turmoil |date=25 February 2011}}</ref>

In November 2014, Mauritania was invited as a non-member guest nation to the G20 summit in Brisbane.

{{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}}}, Mauritania had a population of approximately 4.3 million. The local population is divided into three main ethnic tiers: [[Sahrawi people|Bidhan]] or [[Moors]], [[Haratin]], and [[West Africa]]ns. The CIA [[World Factbook]] estimates 30% Bidhan, 40% Haratin, and 30% others. Local statistics bureau estimations indicates that the Bidhan represent around 53% of citizens. They speak [[Hassaniya Arabic]] and are primarily of [[Arab-Berber]] origin. The Haratin constitute roughly 34% of the population. They are descendants of former [[Slavery in Africa|slaves]] and also speak Arabic. The remaining 13% of the population largely consists of various ethnic groups of West African descent. Among these are the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]]-speaking [[Fula people|Halpulaar]] (Fulbe), [[Soninke people|Soninke]], [[Bambara people|Bambara]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]].<ref name="CIA">{{cite web|title=The World Factbook – Africa – Mauritania|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mr.html|publisher=CIA}}</ref>

The government bureaucracy is composed of traditional ministries, special agencies, and [[parastatal]] companies. The Ministry of Interior spearheads a system of regional governors and prefects modeled on the French system of local administration. Under this system, Mauritania is divided into 15 regions (''[[wilaya]]'' or ''régions'').

Control is tightly concentrated in the executive branch of the central government, but a series of national and municipal elections since 1992 have produced limited [[decentralization]]. These regions are subdivided into 44 [[departments of Mauritania|departments]] (''moughataa''). The regions and capital district (in alphabetical order) and their capitals are:

Mauritania is  in the western region of the continent of Africa, is generally flat, its 1,030,700 square kilometres forming vast, arid plains broken by occasional ridges and clifflike outcroppings.<ref name="Schlüter2008"/> It borders the North [[Atlantic Ocean]], between [[Senegal]] and [[Western Sahara]], [[Mali]] and [[Algeria]].<ref name="Schlüter2008">{{cite book|author=Thomas Schlüter|title=Geological Atlas of Africa: With Notes on Stratigraphy, Tectonics, Economic Geology, Geohazards, Geosites and Geoscientific Education of Each Country|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfvKWpsISTQC&pg=PA166|year=2008|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-76373-4|page=166}}</ref> It is considered part of both the [[Sahel]] and the [[Maghreb]]. A series of scarps face southwest, longitudinally bisecting these plains in the center of the country. The scarps also separate a series of sandstone plateaus, the highest of which is the [[Adrar Plateau]], reaching an elevation of 500 metres. <ref name="Hughes1992">{{cite book|author=R. H. Hughes|title=A Directory of African Wetlands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLjafeXa3gMC&pg=PA401|year=1992|publisher=IUCN|isbn=978-2-88032-949-5|page=401}}</ref>Spring-fed oases lie at the foot of some of the scarps. Isolated peaks, often rich in minerals, rise above the plateaus; the smaller peaks are called guelbs and the larger ones kedias. The concentric [[Guelb er Richat]] is a prominent feature of the north-central region. [[Kediet ej Jill]], near the city of [[Zouîrât]], has an elevation of 1,000 metres and is the highest peak.

Approximately three-quarters of Mauritania is desert or semidesert.<ref name="Wane2009">{{cite book|author=Njoki N. Wane|title=A Glance at Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSyMf6m6E9wC&pg=PA58|year=2009|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=978-1-4389-7489-7|pages=58–}}</ref> As a result of extended, severe drought, the desert has been expanding since the mid-1960s. The plateaus gradually descend toward the northeast to the barren [[El Djouf]], or "Empty Quarter," a vast region of large sand dunes that merges into the [[Sahara Desert]]. To the west, between the ocean and the plateaus, are alternating areas of clayey plains (regs) and sand dunes (ergs), some of which shift from place to place, gradually moved by high winds. The dunes generally increase in size and mobility toward the north.

Belts of natural vegetation, corresponding to the rainfall pattern, extend from east to west and range from traces of tropical forest along the [[Sénégal River]] to brush and savanna in the southeast. Only sandy desert is found in the centre and north of the country.

Despite being rich in natural resources, Mauritania has a low GDP.<ref name="Dept.2015">{{cite book|author=International Monetary Fund. Middle East and Central Asia Dept.|title=Islamic Republic of Mauritania: Selected Issues Paper|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohP5BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA19|year=2015|publisher=International Monetary Fund|isbn=978-1-4843-3657-1|pages=19–22}}</ref> A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name="Dept.2015"/> Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports.  Gold and copper mining companies are opening mines in the interior.

The country's first [[deepwater port]] opened near [[Nouakchott]] in 1986. In recent years, drought and economic mismanagement have resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In March 1999, the government signed an agreement with a joint [[World Bank]]-[[International Monetary Fund]] mission on a $54&nbsp;million enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). Privatization remains one of the key issues. Mauritania is unlikely to meet ESAF's annual GDP growth objectives of 4–5%.

[[Petroleum|Oil]] was discovered in Mauritania in 2001 in the offshore [[Chinguetti field]]. Although potentially significant for the Mauritanian economy, its overall influence is difficult to predict. Mauritania has been described as a "desperately poor desert nation, which straddles the Arab and African worlds and is Africa's newest, if small-scale, oil producer."<ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2008/08/07/mauritania_junta_promises_free_elections.html Mauritania junta promises free elections]. thestar.com (7 August 2008).</ref> There may be additional oil reserves inland in the [[Taoudeni basin]], although the harsh environment will make extraction expensive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barakapetroleum.com/mauritania/taoudeni-basin/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224221844/http://www.barakapetroleum.com/mauritania/taoudeni-basin/|archivedate=24 February 2009|title=Taoudeni Basin Overview|publisher=Baraka Petroleum|accessdate=14 March 2009}}</ref>

United Arab Emirates government, via its pilot green city Masdar, announced it will install new solar plants in the city of Atar which will supply an additional 16.6 megawatts of electricity.

In 2012, a government minister stated that slavery "no longer exists" in Mauritania.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/17/mauritanian-minister-responds-to-accusations-that-slavery-is-rampant/ |work=CNN |title=Mauritanian minister responds to accusations that slavery is rampant |date=17 March 2012 |quote=I must tell you that in Mauritania, freedom is total: freedom of thought, equality – of all men and women of Mauritania... in all cases, especially with this government, this is in the past.

Obstacles to ending slavery in Mauritania include:
* The difficulty of enforcing any laws in the country's vast desert<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
* Poverty that limits opportunities for slaves to support themselves if freed<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
* Belief that slavery is part of the natural order of this society.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>

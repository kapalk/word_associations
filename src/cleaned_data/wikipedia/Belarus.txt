In the aftermath of the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Belarus declared independence as the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], which was conquered by Soviet Russia.

In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, forming the [[Union State]]. Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49&nbsp;million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic [[Belarusians|Belarusian]], with sizable minorities of [[Russians]], [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The second-most widespread religion, [[Catholic Church in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]], has a much smaller following; nevertheless, Belarus celebrates both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter as [[Public holidays in Belarus|national holidays]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://president.gov.by/special/en/holidays_en/| title=The official Internet portal of the President of the Republic of Belarus.

Belarus has shown no aspirations for joining the [[European Union]] but nevertheless maintains a [[Belarus–European Union relations|bilateral relationship with the organisation]], and likewise participates in two EU projects: the [[Eastern Partnership]] and the [[Baku Initiative]].

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
The name ''Belarus'' is closely related with the term ''Belaya Rus{{'}}'', i.e., ''[[White Rus']]''. There are several claims to the origin of the name ''White Rus'.''<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2">{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=2}}</ref> An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old [[Ruthenia]]n lands within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] that had been populated mostly by [[Slavs]] who had been Christianized early, as opposed to [[Black Ruthenia]], which was predominantly inhabited by pagan [[Balts]].<ref>Аб паходжанні назваў Белая і Чорная Русь (Eng. "About the Origins of the Names of White and Black Ruthenia"), Язэп Юхо (Joseph Juho), 1956.</ref>

An alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population.<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Minahan|1998|p=35}}</ref> A third theory suggests that the old Rus' lands that were not conquered by the [[Tatars]] (i.e., Polotsk, Vitebsk and Mogilev) had been referred to as "White Rus'".<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 2"/>

The name ''Rus'' is often conflated with its Latin forms ''Russia'' and ''Ruthenia'', thus Belarus is often referred to as ''White Russia'' or ''White Ruthenia''. The name first appeared in [[Medieval German literature|German]] and [[Medieval Latin literature|Latin]] [[medieval literature]]; the chronicles of [[Jan of Czarnków]] mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke [[Jogaila]] and his mother at "{{lang|la|Albae Russiae, Poloczk dicto}}" in 1381.<ref name="vauchez">{{Harvnb|Vauchez|Dobson|Lapidge|2001|p=163}}</ref> In some languages, including German, Afrikaans and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the country is generally called "White Russia" to this day (''{{lang|de|Weißrussland}}'' and ''{{lang|nl|Wit-Rusland}}'' respectively).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Laenderinformationen/00-SiHi/BelarusSicherheit.html |title=Belarus: Reise- und Sicherheitshinweise |work=Auswärtiges Amt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/reisadviezen/inhoud/belarus-wit-rusland|title=Reisadvies Belarus (Wit-Rusland) |publisher= }}</ref>

The Latin term "Alba Russia" was used again by [[Pope Pius VI]] in 1783 to recognize the [[Society of Jesus]] there, exclaiming "{{lang|la|Approbo Societatem Jesu in Alba Russia degentem, approbo, approbo}}."<ref>{{Harvnb|de Courson|1879|p=281}}</ref> The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]], who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court.<ref name="alies">{{cite book |last=Bely |first=Alies |title=The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name |publisher=Encyclopedix |year=2000 |location=Minsk, Belarus |isbn=985-6599-12-1 |ref=harv }}</ref> During the 17th century, the Russian [[tsar]]s used "White Rus" to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.<ref>{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2001|p=327}}</ref>
[[File:Stemp Efrasinia Polackaja.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Stamp with the [[Cross of Saint Euphrosyne|Cross of St. Euphrosyne]] from 1992]]

The term ''Belorussia'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Белору́ссия}}, the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, ''Russia'') first rose in the days of the [[Russian Empire]], and the Russian Tsar was usually styled "the Tsar of All the Russias", as ''Russia'' or the ''Russian Empire'' was formed by three parts of Russia—the [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Ruthenia|White]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XAItI5C_JPUC&pg=PA116&dq=Belorussia+Russian+Empire |title=Where Nation-States Come From: Institutional Change in the Age of Nationalism |author=Philip G.

After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, the term "White Russia" caused some confusion, as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Richmond|1995|p=260}}</ref> During the period of the Byelorussian SSR, the term ''Byelorussia'' was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, ''Byelorussia'' became commonly used in the regions of [[Białystok]] and [[Grodno]] during the interwar period.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ioffe |first=Grigory |title=Understanding Belarus and How Western Foreign Policy Misses the Mark |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc |date=25 February 2008 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00B6wxgftH8C&pg=PA150&dq=west+belarus |isbn=0-7425-5558-5 }}</ref>

The term ''Byelorussia'' (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus|Supreme Soviet]] of the Byelorussian SSR decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Republic of Belarus'' ({{lang|ru|Республика Беларусь}} spelled in Russian), and that its abridged form should be "Belarus". The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their [[Belarusian language]] forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993.<ref name="bynamelaw">{{cite web |url=http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm |title=Law of the Republic of Belarus—About the name of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=6 October 2007 |date=19 September 1991 |publisher=Pravo—Law of the Republic of Belarus |language=Russian }}</ref> Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the [[Constitution of Belarus]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ryder|1998|p=183}}</ref>

Accordingly, the name ''Byelorussia'' was replaced by ''Belarus'' in English.<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 4-5">{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|pp=4–5}}</ref> Likewise, the adjective ''Belorussian'' or ''Byelorussian'' was replaced by ''Belarusian'' in English. ''Belarusian'' is closer to the original Belarusian term of ''{{lang|be-Latn|bielaruski}}''.<ref name="Zaprudnik 1993 4-5"/> Belarusian intelligentsia in the [[Stalin era]] attempted to change the name from ''Byelorussia'' to a form of ''Krivia'' because of the supposed connection with Russia.<ref>{{Harvnb|Treadgold|Ellison|1999|p=230}}</ref> Some nationalists object to the name for the same reason.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://euroradio.fm/en/swedish-government-urged-change-belarus-official-name |title=Swedish government urged to change Belarus' official name |accessdate=2 February 2010|date=13 July 2009 |work=European Radio for Belarus }}</ref><ref name="levy">{{Harvnb|Levy|Spilling|2009|p=95}}</ref> Several local newspapers kept the old name of the country in Russian in their names, for example ''{{lang|ru-Latn|[[Komsomolskaya Pravda|Komsomolskaya Pravda v Byelorussii]]}}'', which is the localized publication of a popular Russian newspaper.

The region that is now Belarus was first settled by [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by Slavic tribes. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.<ref>{{harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=7}}</ref>

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{Further|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth}}
On 2 February 1386, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] were joined in a [[personal union]] through a [[Union of Krewo|marriage of their rulers]].<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Jones|editor-first=Michael|last=Rowell|first=S.C.|contribution=Baltic Europe|title=The New Cambridge Medieval History (Vol. 6)|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|page=710|isbn=0-521-36290-3}}</ref> This union set in motion the developments that eventually resulted in the formation of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], created in 1569 by the [[Union of Lublin]].

The Lithuanian nobles were forced to go for rapprochement because of the threat coming from [[Muscovy]].
To strengthen the independence in the format of the union, three editions of the [[Statutes of Lithuania]] were issued in the 16th century. 
The third Article of the Statute establishes that all lands of Grand Duchy of Lithuania will be eternally in Grand Duchy of Lithuania and never enter as a part of other states. It allowed to own the land within Grand Duchy of Lithuania only to own families. Anyone from outside Duchy would be honored with property only own it after swearing to Grand Duke of Lithuania. These articles were aimed to defend the rights of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania nobility against Polish, Prussian and other aristocracy of [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

In the years following the union, the process of gradual [[Polonization]] of both Lithuanians and Ruthenians gained steady momentum. In culture and social life, both the [[Polish language]] and [[Catholicism]] became dominant, and in 1696, Polish replaced Ruthenian as the official language—with the Ruthenian language being banned from administrative use.<ref>[http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&menu=00 "Belarusian": UCLA Language Materials Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222171418/http://www.lmp.ucla.edu/Profile.aspx?LangID=103&menu=00 |date=22 December 2015 }}, ucla.edu; accessed 4 March 2016.</ref> However, the Ruthenian peasants, continued to speak their own language and remained faithful to the [[Belarusian Greek Catholic Church]]. Statutes were initially only issued in [[Ruthenian language]] and later also in Polish. Around 1840 the Statutes were banned by the Russian tsar following the [[November Uprising]]. Modern Ukrainian lands used it until 1860s.

The Belarusian People's Republic was the first attempt to create an independent Belarusian state under name "Belarus".

It existed only from 1918 to 1919 but created prerequisites for the formation of the state idea around the name "Belarus".

The Byelorussian SSR was one of the two Soviet republics that joined the [[United Nations]] along with the Ukrainian SSR as one of the original 51 members in 1945. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, under international law, Belarus became the internationally recognized successor state to the Byelorussian SSR, retaining its UN membership.

After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs.

This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tereshkovich|first=Pavel|author2=Robert J.

[[Music of Belarus|Music in Belarus]] largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 19th century, Polish composer [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]] and created the opera ''Sialanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.<ref>{{cite news|first=Crystal|last=Zou|title=Ballets for Christmas|date=11 December 2003|url=http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html|work=Shanghai Star|accessdate=20 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050225084753/http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html|archivedate=25 February 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[Wheat]] and [[rye]] breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of [[bread and salt]] when greeting a guest or visitor.<ref>Canadian Citizenship and Immigration&nbsp;– [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project&nbsp;– Eating the Belarusian Way] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320041709/http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html |date=20 March 2007 }} (1998); retrieved 21 March 2007.</ref>

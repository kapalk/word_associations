The political history of the modern state of Afghanistan began with the Hotak and Durrani dynasties in the 18th century. In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in the "[[The Great Game|Great Game]]" between [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Its border with British India, the [[Durand Line]], was formed in 1893 but it is not recognized by the Afghan government and it has led to strained relations with Pakistan since the latter's independence in 1947. Following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919 the country was free of foreign influence, eventually becoming [[Kingdom of Afghanistan|a monarchy]] under [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]], until almost 50 years later when [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] was [[1973 Afghan coup d'état|overthrown]] and a [[Republic of Afghanistan|republic]] was established. In 1978, after a [[Saur Revolution|second coup]] Afghanistan first [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|became a socialist state]] and then a [[Soviet Union]] protectorate. This evoked the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] in the 1980s against [[Mujahideen#Afghanistan|mujahideen]] rebels. By 1996 most of Afghanistan was captured by the [[Islamic fundamentalist]] group the [[Taliban]], who ruled most of the country as a [[totalitarian]] regime [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|for over five years]]. The Taliban were [[Battle of Tora Bora|forcibly removed]] by the [[NATO]]-led [[International Security Assistance Force|coalition]], and a new democratically-elected government political structure was formed.

Afghanistan is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[Islamic republic]] with a population of 31 million, mostly composed of ethnic [[Pashtuns]], [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]] and [[Uzbeks]]. It is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], the [[Group of 77]], the [[Economic Cooperation Organization]], and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. [[Economy of Afghanistan|Afghanistan's economy]] is the world's 108th largest, with a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] of $64.08 billion; the country fares much worse in terms of per-capita GDP (PPP), ranking 167th out of 186 countries in a 2016 report from the [[International Monetary Fund]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2017/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=43&pr.y=5&sy=2016&ey=2016&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=512,672,914,946,612,137,614,546,311,962,213,674,911,676,193,548,122,556,912,678,313,181,419,867,513,682,316,684,913,273,124,868,339,921,638,948,514,943,218,686,963,688,616,518,223,728,516,836,918,558,748,138,618,196,624,278,522,692,622,694,156,142,626,449,628,564,228,565,924,283,233,853,632,288,636,293,634,566,238,964,662,182,960,359,423,453,935,968,128,922,611,714,321,862,243,135,248,716,469,456,253,722,642,942,643,718,939,724,644,576,819,936,172,961,132,813,646,199,648,733,915,184,134,524,652,361,174,362,328,364,258,732,656,366,654,734,336,144,263,146,268,463,532,528,944,923,176,738,534,578,536,537,429,742,433,866,178,369,436,744,136,186,343,925,158,869,439,746,916,926,664,466,826,112,542,111,967,298,443,927,917,846,544,299,941,582,446,474,666,754,668,698&s=PPPPC&grp=0&a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|website=www.imf.org}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Name of Afghanistan}}
The name ''Afghānistān'' ({{lang-ps|افغانستان}}) is believed to be as old as the [[ethnonym]] [[Afghan (ethnonym)|''Afghan'']], which is documented in the 10th-century [[geography]] book ''[[Hudud ul-'alam]]''. The [[root (linguistics)|root]] name "[[Afghan]]" was used [[history|historically]] in reference to a member of the ethnic [[Pashtuns]], and the [[suffix]] "[[-stan]]" means "place of" in [[Persian Language|Persian]]. Therefore, Afghanistan translates to ''land of the Afghans'' or, more specifically in a historical sense, to ''land of the Pashtuns''. However, the modern [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] states that "[t]he word Afghan shall apply to every [[Demographics of Afghanistan|citizen of Afghanistan]]."<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.embassyofafghanistan.org/page/constitution |year=2004 |accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>

[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavations]] of prehistoric sites by [[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Dupree]] and others suggest that humans were living in what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago, and that farming communities in the area were among the earliest in the world.

The country sits at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], and the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]].<ref>The Indo-Aryans of Ancient South Asia: Language, Material Culture and Ethnicity by George Erdosy, p.321</ref>

Many empires and kingdoms have also risen to power in Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally the [[Hotak dynasty|Hotak]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state.<ref>The History of Afghanistan by Meredith L.

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan. Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of [[Mundigak]] (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. More recent findings established that the Indus Valley Civilisation stretched up towards modern-day Afghanistan, making the ancient civilisation today part of Pakistan, Afghanistan and India. In more detail, it extended from what today is northwest Pakistan to northwest India and northeast Afghanistan. An Indus Valley site has been found on the [[Oxus River]] at [[Shortugai]] in northern Afghanistan.<ref name="The Ancient Indus pp.1">The Ancient Indus: Urbanism, Economy, and Society. pp.1</ref><ref>Kenoyer, Jonathan Mark (1998).

After 2000 BCE, successive waves of semi-nomadic people from Central Asia began moving south into Afghanistan; among them were many [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] [[Indo-Iranians]]. These tribes later migrated further into South Asia, Western Asia, and toward Europe via the area north of the [[Caspian Sea]]. The region at the time was referred to as [[Ariana]].<ref name="JFS" /><ref>Bryant, Edwin F.

The religion [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]]. Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism. By the middle of the 6th century BCE, the Achaemenids overthrew the [[Medes]] and incorporated [[Arachosia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]], and [[Bactria]] within its eastern boundaries. An [[Epigraphy|inscription]] on the tombstone of [[Darius I of Persia]] mentions the [[Kabulistan|Kabul Valley]] in a list of the 29 countries that he had conquered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909000527/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation |publisher=Gandhara.com.au | date=15 February 1989 |accessdate=19 May 2012}}</ref>

[[Alexander the Great]] and his Macedonian forces arrived to Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]]. Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown in about 185 BCE. Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] reconquest by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away from them and became part of the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. They were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.<ref name="LoC-pdf">{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] on Afghanistan | date=August 2008 |accessdate=10 October 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140408085103/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Afghanistan.pdf |archivedate=8 April 2014 }}</ref><ref>The History of Afghanistan by Meredith L.

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region, but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region. They were followed by the [[Kidarite]] who, in turn, were replaced by the [[Hephthalites]]. By the 6th century CE, the successors to the Kushans and Hepthalites established a small dynasty called [[Kabul Shahi]]. Much of the northeastern and southern areas of the country remained dominated by Buddhist culture.<ref name="Habibi">{{cite web |url=http://www.alamahabibi.com/English%20Articles/Afghan_and_Afghanistan.htm |title=Afghan and Afghanistan |work=[[Abdul Hai Habibi]]|publisher=alamahabibi.com|year=1969|accessdate=17 November 2015}}</ref>

[[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s brought Islam to [[Herat]] and [[Zaranj]] in 642&nbsp;CE and began spreading eastward; some of the native inhabitants they encountered accepted it while others revolted. The land was collectively recognized by the Arabs as al-Hind due to its cultural connection with [[Greater India]]. Before Islam was introduced, people of the region were mostly Buddhists and Zoroastrians, but there were also [[Surya]] and [[Nana (Afghan goddess)|Nana]] worshipers, [[History of the Jews in Afghanistan|Jews]], and others. The [[Zunbils]] and Kabul Shahi were first conquered in 870&nbsp;CE by the [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarid]] Muslims of Zaranj. Later, the [[Samanids]] extended their Islamic influence south of the [[Hindu]] Kush.

By the 11th century, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] defeated the remaining Hindu rulers and effectively [[Islamized]] the wider region, with the exception of [[Kafiristan]]. Afghanistan became one of the main centers in the [[Muslim world]] during this [[Islamic Golden Age]]. The [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]] was overthrown by the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], who expanded and advanced the already powerful Islamic empire.

In 1219&nbsp;AD, [[Genghis Khan]] and his [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] army overran the region.

After the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] on 19 August 1919, King [[Amānullāh Khān|Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independence|independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [[slavery]] was abolished in 1923.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1976| volume = Volume 25| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Americana]]|publisher=Americana Corporation | page = 24 }}</ref>

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-05499, Berlin, Besuch König von Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|King [[Amanullah Khan]] and Queen [[Soraya Tarzi]] on a visit to Berlin in 1928]]
Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]], a fifteen-year-old [[Hazara people|Hazara]] student.

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan.

The King built close relationships with the [[Axis powers]] in the 1930s - but Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]] thereafter. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet [[development aid]] than any other country. Afghanistan had therefore good relations with both Cold War enemies. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a [[1973 Afghan coup|bloodless coup]] and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]], abolishing the monarchy. In the meantime, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan.

In April 1978, the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in the [[Saur Revolution]], a [[coup d'état]] against then-President [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]]. The PDPA declared the establishment of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]], with its first President named as [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]].

Opposition to PDPA reforms, such as its land redistribution policy and modernization of (traditional Islamic) civil and marriage laws, led to unrest which aggravated to rebellion and revolt around October 1978, first in eastern Afghanistan (see [[Soviet–Afghan War#Initiation of the insurgency|Initiation of the insurgency in Afghanistan 1978]]). That uprising quickly expanded into a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] waged by guerrilla [[mujahideen]] against regime forces countrywide. The Pakistani government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the [[Soviet Union]] sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA regime.<ref>{{cite book |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |title=Pakistan And The Emergence Of Islamic Militancy In Afghanistan |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2005 |pages=108–109 |isbn=978-0-7546-4434-7}}</ref>
As early as mid-1979 (see ''[[CIA activities in Afghanistan]]''), the [[Operation Cyclone|United States]] were supporting Afghan ''[[mujahideen]]'' and foreign "[[Afghan Arab]]" fighters through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]].<ref name=Meher>{{cite book |last=Meher |first=Jagmohan |title=America's Afghanistan War: The Success that Failed |publisher=Gyan Books |year=2004 |pages=68–69, 94 |isbn=978-81-7835-262-6}}</ref>

Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&nbsp;— the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]&nbsp;— resulted (in July–August 1979) in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup.

In September 1979, President Taraki was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. The Soviet Union was displeased with Amin's government, and decided to intervene and invade the country on 27 December 1979, killing Amin that same day.

A Soviet-organized regime, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions (Parcham and Khalq), filled the vacuum. Soviet troops in more substantial numbers were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal, and as a result the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan (of mujahideen against PDPA government),<ref>{{cite book |last=Kalinovsky |first=Artemy M. |title=A Long Goodbye: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2011 |pages=25–28 |isbn=978-0-674-05866-8}}</ref> which war from December 1979 until 1989 is therefore also known as the [[Soviet–Afghan War]].

=== Proxy and civil war and Islamic jihad 1989–96 ===
{{Main|Afghan Civil War (1989–92)|Afghan Civil War (1992–96)}}
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:NajibInterview.png|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Mohammad Najibullah]], President of Afghanistan from 1987 to 1992]] -->
[[Mujahideen]] ([[Islam]]ic resistance) forces in October 1978 (see above) had started a guerrilla or civil war against the [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|PDPA]]'s government of Afghanistan. After the [[Soviet–Afghan War#Soviet intervention and coup|Soviet invasion, December 1979]], replacing one PDPA President for another PDPA President, the mujahideen proclaimed to be battling the hostile PDPA "[[Puppet state|puppet regime]]".<ref name=Stenersen>[https://www.prio.org/utility/Download.ashx?x=228 'Mujahidin vs. Communists: Revisiting the battles of Jalalabad and Khost].

Retrieved 1 February 2018.</ref> 
In 1987, [[Mohammad Najibullah]] had become Afghan President, and after the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|Soviet withdrawal in 1989]] he was still sponsored by the [[Soviet Union]],<ref name=Stenersen/> and fought by the mujahideen.

President Najibullah therefore tried to build support for his government by moving away from socialism to pan-Afghan [[nationalism]], abolishing the [[one-party state]], portraying his government as [[Islam]]ic,{{Clarify|reason=How do you mean: 'portraying as Islamic'?| date=February 2018}} and in 1990 removing all signs of communism.{{Citation needed| date=February 2018}}

Nevertheless, Najibullah did not win any significant support. In March 1989, two mujahideen groups launched an attack on [[Jalalabad]], instigated by the [[Pakistan]]i [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) who wanted to see a mujahideen [[Islam]]ic government established in Afghanistan, but the attack failed after three months. With the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991 and the ending of [[Russia]]n support, President Najibullah was left without foreign aid. In March 1991, mujahideen forces attacked and conquered the city of [[Khost]].

In March 1992, President Najibullah agreed to step aside and make way for a mujahideen coalition government.
Mujahideen leaders came together in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, to negotiate such a government, but mujahideen [[Hezbi Islami]]'s leader [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], presumably supported by [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], refused to meet other leaders. On 16 April 1992, four Afghani government Generals ousted President Najibullah. Little later, Hezbi Islami invaded [[Kabul]]. This ignited war in Kabul on 25 April with rivalling groups [[Jamiat-e Islami|Jamiat]] and [[National Islamic Movement of Afghanistan|Junbish]] in which soon two more mujahideen groups mingled; all groups except Jamiat were supported by an Islamic foreign government ([[Saudi Arabia]], [[Iran]], [[Uzbekistan]]) or intelligence agency (Pakistan's ISI).<ref name="Amin Saikal">{{cite book |last=Amin Saikal |authorlink=Amin Saikal |title=Modern Afghanistan: A History of Struggle and Survival |edition=2006 1st |page=352 |publisher=I.B.

Shortly after their fall from power, the Taliban began an [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]] to regain control of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and [[Afghan National Army|Afghan troops]] led many offensives against the Taliban, but failed to fully defeat them.

Meanwhile, the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] was able to build some democratic structures, and the country changed its name to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

[[File:New Afghan Parliament Building.png|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Afghanistan]] in 2016]]

Afghanistan is an [[Islamic republic]] consisting of three branches, the executive, legislative, and judicial. The nation is led by President [[Ashraf Ghani]] with [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] and [[Sarwar Danish]] as vice presidents. [[Abdullah Abdullah]] serves as the chief executive officer (CEO). The [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|National Assembly]] is the legislature, a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] body having two chambers, the [[House of the People (Afghanistan)|House of the People]] and the [[House of Elders]].

The [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 Afghan presidential election]] was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout, and widespread electoral fraud.<ref name="Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped">{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Helene |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html |title=Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped |publisher=Nytimes.com | date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511225923/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}</ref> The vote, along with elections for 420 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provincial council]] seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.

Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger [[Abdullah Abdullah|Abdullah]] was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he would not participate in 7 November run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met. The next day, officials of the election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President for another five-year term.<ref name="Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped" />

In the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], among the elected officials were former mujahideen, [[Islamic fundamentalists]], warlords, communists, [[reformists]], and several Taliban associates.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/rawagallery.php?mghash=dc96d38caecd6694eb17fc894bb73212&mggal=2 |title=RAWA Photo Gallery: They are Responsible for Afghanistan's Tragedy |publisher=RAWA |accessdate=11 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019075455/http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/rawagallery.php?mghash=dc96d38caecd6694eb17fc894bb73212&mggal=2 |archivedate=19 October 2010 |deadurl=no}}</ref> In the same period, Afghanistan reached to the 30th highest nation in terms of female representation in the National Assembly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification |publisher=Ipu.org | date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=29 December 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328105108/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |archivedate=28 March 2014 }}</ref> The last [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary election]] was held in September 2010, but due to disputes and investigation of fraud, the swearing-in ceremony took place in late January 2011.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Provinces of Afghanistan|Districts of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (''[[wilayah|wilayats]]''). Each province is the size of a [[County (United States)|U.S. county]], having a [[governor]] and a [[Capital city|capital]]. The country is further divided into nearly 400 provincial [[Districts of Afghanistan|districts]], each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The [[list of current governors of Afghanistan|provincial governors]] are appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]] and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/world/asia/for-afghan-officials-prospect-of-death-comes-with-territory.html|title=For Afghan Officials, Prospect of Death Comes With Territory|last=Ahmed|first=Azam| date=8 December 2012|work=The New York Times|access-date=7 April 2017|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&cnid=24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827204439/http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&cnid=24 |archivedate=27 August 2010 |title=Explaining Elections, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan |publisher=Iec.org.af | date=9 October 2004 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}</ref> The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, mayors of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. In the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

The following is a list of all the 34 provinces in alphabetical order:

As a [[major non-NATO ally]], the [[Afghan Armed Forces]] receive most of their equipment and [[Resolute Support Mission|training]] from the [[Afghanistan–United States relations|United States]].]]
Afghanistan became a member of the United Nations in 1946. It enjoys cordial relations with a number of [[NATO]] and allied nations, particularly the [[Afghanistan–United States relations|United States]], [[Afghanistan–Canada relations|Canada]], [[Afghanistan–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], [[Afghanistan–Germany relations|Germany]], Australia, and [[Afghanistan–Turkey relations|Turkey]]. In 2012, the United States and Afghanistan signed their [[U.S.–Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement|Strategic Partnership Agreement]] in which Afghanistan became a [[major non-NATO ally]]. Afghanistan also has friendly diplomatic relations with neighboring [[Afghanistan–China relations|China]], [[Afghanistan–Iran relations|Iran]], [[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations|Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan–Tajikistan relations|Tajikistan]], [[Foreign relations of Turkmenistan#Afghanistan|Turkmenistan]], and [[Foreign relations of Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], including with regional states such as [[Afghanistan–Bangladesh relations|Bangladesh]], [[Afghanistan–India relations|India]], [[Afghanistan–Japan relations|Japan]], [[Foreign relations of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Foreign relations of Nepal|Nepal]], [[Afghanistan–Russia relations|Russia]], [[Afghanistan–South Korea relations|South Korea]], the [[Afghanistan–United Arab Emirates relations|UAE]], and so forth. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] continues to develop [[Foreign relations of Afghanistan|diplomatic relations]] with other countries around the world.

The [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) was established in 2002 in order to help the country recover from the decades of war and neglect. Today, a number of NATO member states deploy about 20,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the [[Resolute Support Mission]]. Its main purpose is to [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan|train]] the [[Afghan National Security Forces]]. The [[Afghan Armed Forces]] are under the [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]], which includes the [[Afghan Air Force]] (AAF) and the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA). The [[Afghan Defense University]] houses various educational establishments for the Afghan Armed Forces, including the [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Glasch|first1=Mike|title=USACE TAA employee named top engineer|url=https://www.army.mil/article/156986/USACE_TAA_employee_named_top_engineer|website=Army.mil|publisher=US Army|accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref>

=== Law enforcement ===
{{Main|Law enforcement in Afghanistan}}
[[File:ANP trucks in Kunar.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) in [[Kunar Province]]]]
The [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS) is Afghanistan's domestic [[intelligence agency]], which operates similar to that of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]] or [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[Scotland Yard]]. The [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) is under the [[Ministry of Interior Affairs (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Interior Affairs]] and serves as a single [[law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement agency]] all across the country. The [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] is the main branch of the ANP, which is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, [[Gardez]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. There is one [[Chief of Police]] in every province.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

All parts of Afghanistan are considered dangerous due to militant activities and terrorism-related incidents. Kidnapping for ransom and robberies are common in major cities. Every year hundreds of Afghan police are [[list of Afghan security forces fatality reports in Afghanistan|killed]] in the line of duty. The [[Afghan Border Police]] (ABP) is responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed [[Durand Line]] border, which is often used by terrorists and criminals for their illegal activities. Drugs from Afghanistan are smuggled to neighboring countries by various nationals but mostly by Afghans, Iranians, Pakistanis, Tajikistanis, Turkmenistanis and Uzbekistanis. The [[Ministry of Counter Narcotics (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics]] is responsible for the monitoring and eradication of the illegal drug business.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

About 2700 of 169 000 police are women. Afghan society and the Interior Ministry of Afghanistan hold a generally negative view against women working as police. A United Nations report given to the ministry in 2013 was never released, for fears of reprisals against female police. The report found that 70% of the 130 policewomen had experience sexual harassment and a smaller number had reported being raped or pressured into having sex. Due to attacks and harassment, female police avoid wearing their uniform on their way to work. The issue of how female police are treated in Afghanistan is a sensitive issue for Western governments who have donated funds towards training women for the security forces.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/02/world/asia/afghan-policewomen-struggle-against-culture.html|title=Afghan Policewomen Struggle Against Culture|last=Rubin|first=Alissa J.|date=1 March 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=5 January 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

While the nation's current account deficit is largely financed with donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-20/taliban-winning-race-to-capture-1-trillion-afghan-mining-riches |title=The Taliban Is Capturing Afghanistan's $1 Trillion in Mining Wealth |publisher=www.bloomberg.com | date=20 October 2015 |accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref> The [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Finance]] is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline.

Afghans are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes. As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. One writer considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.<ref name="Heathcote">Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) "The Afghan Wars 1839–1919", Sellmount Staplehurst.</ref> There are various [[ethnic groups in Afghanistan|Afghan tribes]], and an estimated 2–3 million [[Kochi people|nomads]].<ref>"[http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=76794 Afghanistan: Kuchi nomads seek a better deal]".

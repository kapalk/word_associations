Retrieved on 16 November 2016.</ref> officially the '''Republic of Turkmenistan''', is a country in [[Central Asia]], bordered by [[Kazakhstan]] to the northwest, [[Uzbekistan]] to the north and east, [[Afghanistan]] to the southeast, [[Iran]] to the south and southwest, and the [[Caspian Sea]] to the west. [[Ashgabat]] is the capital and largest city. The population of the country is 5.6 million, the lowest of the Central Asian republics and one of the most sparsely populated in Asia.

Turkmenistan has been at the crossroads of civilizations for centuries. In medieval times, [[Merv]] was one of the great cities of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and an important stop on the [[Silk Road]], a caravan route used for trade with [[China]] until the mid-15th century. Annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1881, Turkmenistan later figured prominently in the [[Russian Civil War|anti-Bolshevik movement]] in Central Asia. In 1925, Turkmenistan became a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Turkmen SSR); it became independent upon the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.<ref name=cia />

Turkmenistan possesses the world's sixth [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|largest reserves of natural gas resources]].<ref name="TM Gas Reserves">{{cite web |url=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/new-customer-turkmen-natural-gas |title= A New Customer for Turkmen Natural Gas| accessdate= 22 November 2017}}</ref> Most of the country is covered by the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum (Black Sand) Desert]].

The [[sovereign state]] of Turkmenistan was ruled by [[President for Life]] [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] (also known as ''Turkmenbashi'') until his death in 2006. [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]] was elected president in 2007. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], "Turkmenistan remains one of the world’s most repressive countries.

== Etymology ==
The name of Turkmenistan ({{lang-tk|Türkmenistan}}) can be divided into two components: the ethnonym [[Turkmens|Türkmen]] and the Persian suffix [[-stan]] meaning "place of" or "country". The name "Turkmen" comes from Turk, plus the [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] suffix -men, meaning "almost Turk", in reference to their status outside the Turkic dynastic mythological system.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Zuev |first=Yury |title= Early Türks: Essays on history and ideology |location= Almatý |publisher= Daik-Press |year= 2002 |page=157 |language=English}}</ref> However, some scholars argue the suffix is an [[intensifier]], changing the meaning of Türkmen to "pure Turks" or "the Turkish Turks."<ref>''US Library of Congress Country Studies.'' "[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/tmtoc.html Turkmenistan]."</ref>

Muslim chroniclers like [[Ibn Kathir]] suggested that the etymology of Turkmenistan came from the words Türk and [[Iman (concept)|Iman]] ({{lang-ar|إيمان}}, "faith, belief") in reference to a massive conversion to Islam of two hundred thousand households in the year 971.<ref>[http://ar.wikisource.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D9%88_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9_-_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D8%B2%D8%A1_11 Ibn Kathir al-Bidaya wa al-Nihaya]. {{ar icon}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Turkmenistan}}
Historically inhabited by the [[Indo-Iranians]], the written history of Turkmenistan begins with its annexation by the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Ancient Iran. In the 8th century AD, [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz]] tribes moved from [[Mongolia]] into present-day Central Asia. Part of a powerful confederation of tribes, these Oghuz formed the ethnic basis of the modern Turkmen population.<ref name=cs>{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Turkmenistan.pdf |title=Country Profile: Turkmenistan |publisher=Library of Congress Federal Research Division |format=PDF |date=February 2007 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref> In the 10th century, the name "Turkmen" was first applied to Oghuz groups that accepted [[Islam]] and began to occupy present-day Turkmenistan.<ref name=cs /> There they were under the dominion of the [[Seljuk Empire]], which was composed of Oghuz groups living in present-day [[Iran]] and Turkmenistan.<ref name=cs /> Turkmen soldiers in the service of the empire played an important role in the spreading of Turkic culture when they migrated westward into present-day [[Azerbaijan]] and eastern [[Turkey]].<ref name=cs />

In the 12th century, [[Turkmens|Turkmen]] and other tribes overthrew the Seljuk Empire.<ref name=cs /> In the next century, the [[Mongols]] took over the more northern lands where the Turkmens had settled, scattering the Turkmens southward and contributing to the formation of new tribal groups.<ref name=cs /> The sixteenth and eighteenth centuries saw a series of splits and confederations among the [[nomad]]ic Turkmen tribes, who remained staunchly independent and inspired fear in their neighbors.<ref name=cs /> By the 16th century, most of those tribes were under the nominal control of two sedentary [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] [[khanate]]s, [[Khanate of Khiva|Khiva]] and [[Khanate of Bukhara|Bukhoro]].<ref name=cs /> Turkmen soldiers were an important element of the Uzbek militaries of this period.<ref name=cs /> In the 19th century, raids and rebellions by the [[Yomud]] Turkmen group resulted in that group's dispersal by the Uzbek rulers.<ref name=cs /> According to Paul R. Spickard, "Prior to the Russian conquest, the Turkmen were known and feared for their involvement in the Central Asian [[History of slavery in Asia|slave trade]]."<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul R.

During the next half-century, Turkmenistan played its designated economic role within the Soviet Union and remained outside the course of major world events.<ref name=cs /> Even the major [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–1991)|liberalization movement]] that shook Russia in the late 1980s had little impact.<ref name=cs /> However, in 1990 the Supreme Soviet of Turkmenistan declared sovereignty as a [[nationalist]] response to perceived exploitation by [[Moscow]].<ref name=cs /> Although Turkmenistan was ill-prepared for independence and then-[[communist]] leader [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] preferred to preserve the Soviet Union, in October 1991 the fragmentation of that entity forced him to call a national referendum that approved independence.<ref name=cs /> On 26 December 1991, the Soviet Union ceased to exist.

After 69 years as part of the [[Soviet Union]] (including 67 years as a union republic), Turkmenistan declared its independence on 27 October 1991.

[[President for Life]] [[Saparmurat Niyazov]], a former bureaucrat of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], ruled Turkmenistan from 1985, when he became head of the [[Communist Party of the Turkmen SSR]], until his death in 2006. He retained absolute control over the country after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. On 28 December 1999, Niyazov was declared President for Life of Turkmenistan by the Mejlis (parliament), which itself had taken office a week earlier in elections that included only candidates hand-picked by President Niyazov. No opposition candidates were allowed.

Since the December 2006 death of Niyazov, Turkmenistan's leadership has made tentative moves to open up the country. His successor, President [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]], repealed some of Niyazov's most idiosyncratic policies, including banning opera and the circus for being ''"insufficiently Turkmen"''. In education, Berdimuhamedow's government increased basic education to ten years from nine years, and higher education was extended from four years to five. It also increased contacts with the West, which is eager for access to the country's natural gas riches.

The politics of Turkmenistan take place in the framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], with the [[President of Turkmenistan|President]] both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. Under Niyazov, Turkmenistan had a [[One-party state|one-party system]]; however, in September 2008, the People's Council unanimously passed a resolution adopting a new [[Constitution of Turkmenistan|Constitution]]. The latter resulted in the abolition of the Council and a significant increase in the size of Parliament in December 2008 and also permits the formation of multiple political parties.

The former Communist Party, now known as the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]], is the dominant party. The second party, the [[Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs]] was established in August 2012. Political gatherings are illegal unless government sanctioned. In 2013 the first multi-party Parliamentary Elections [[Turkmenistani parliamentary election, 2013|were held]] in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan was a one-party state from 1991 to 2012; however, the 2013 elections were widely seen as mere window dressing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/turkmenistan|title=Turkmenistan|publisher=|accessdate=12 February 2016|date=8 September 2014}}</ref> In practice, all parties in parliament operate jointly under the direction of the DPT. There are no true opposition parties in the Turkmen parliament.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://carnegie.ru/2017/05/22/ru-pub-70020|title=Независимому Туркменистану двадцать пять лет: цена авторитаризма|last=Stronski|first=Paul|date=22 May 2017|work=carnegie.ru|language=Russian|accessdate=23 May 2017}}</ref>

The statement issued by the government indicated that all existing satellite dishes would have to be removed or destroyed—despite the communications receiving antennas having been legally installed since 1995—in an effort by the government to fully block access of the population to many "hundreds of independent international media outlets which are currently accessible in the country only through satellite dishes, including all leading international news channels in different languages. The main target of this campaign is [[Radio Azatlyk]], the Turkmen-language service of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]].

== Administrative divisions ==
{{See also|Districts of Turkmenistan}}
{{Turkmenistan Provinces Image Map}}

Turkmenistan is divided into five provinces or ''welayatlar'' (singular ''[[welayat]]'') and one capital city district. The provinces are subdivided into districts (''etraplar'', sing. ''etrap''), which may be either counties or cities. According to the [[Constitution of Turkmenistan]] (Article 16 in the 2008 Constitution, Article 47 in the 1992 Constitution), some cities may have the status of ''welaýat'' (province) or ''etrap'' (district).

{{Main|Geography of Turkmenistan|List of mountains of Turkmenistan}}
[[File:Turkmenistan-map.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Map of Turkmenistan]]

At {{convert|488100|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, Turkmenistan is the world's 52nd-largest country. It is slightly smaller than [[Spain]] and somewhat larger than the US state of [[California]]. It lies between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[43rd parallel north|43° N]], and longitudes [[52nd meridian east|52°]] and [[67th meridian east|67° E]].
Over 80% of the country is covered by the [[Karakum Desert]]. The center of the country is dominated by the [[Turan Depression]] and the Karakum Desert. The [[Kopet Dag]] [[mountain range|Range]], along the southwestern border, reaches {{convert|2,912|m|ft|lk=out|abbr=off}} at Kuh-e Rizeh (Mount Rizeh).<ref>[http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=10469 Kuh-e Rizeh] on Peakbagger.com</ref>

The Great Balkhan Range in the west of the country ([[Balkan Province]]) and the [[Köýtendag Range]] on the southeastern border with Uzbekistan ([[Lebap Province]]) are the only other significant elevations. The Great Balkhan Range rises to {{convert|1880|m|ft}} at [[Gora Arlan|Mount Arlan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=13160 |title=Mount Arlan |publisher=Peakbagger.com |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=30 January 2012}}</ref> and the highest summit in Turkmenistan is [[Ayrybaba]] in the Kugitangtau Range – {{convert|3137|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=10488 |title=Ayrybaba |publisher=Peakbagger.com |date=1 November 2004 |accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref>
The [[Kopet Dag]] mountain range forms most of the border between Turkmenistan and Iran. Rivers include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Murghab River (Tajikistan)|Murghab]], and the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Tejen]].

The climate is mostly arid desert with [[subtropics|subtropical]] temperature ranges and little rainfall. Winters are mild and dry, with most precipitation falling between January and May. The area of the country with the heaviest precipitation is the Kopet Dag Range.

The Turkmen shore along the [[Caspian Sea]] is {{convert|1748|km|mi}} long. The Caspian Sea is entirely landlocked, with no natural access to the ocean, although the [[Volga–Don Canal]] allows shipping access to and from the [[Black Sea]].

The major cities include [[Ashgabat|Aşgabat]], [[Türkmenbaşy, Turkmenistan|Türkmenbaşy]] (formerly Krasnovodsk) and [[Daşoguz]].

The country possesses the world's sixth largest reserves of [[natural gas]] and substantial oil resources.<ref name="TM Gas Reserves" />

Turkmenistan has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to sustain its economy. In 2014, the unemployment rate was estimated to be 11%.<ref name=cia>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tx.html |title=Turkmenistan |publisher=CIA World Factbook |date= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref>
[[File:Bai Bazaar, Dashoguz.jpg|thumb|[[Bazaar]] in [[Daşoguz]]]]

Between 1998 and 2002, Turkmenistan suffered from the continued lack of adequate [[export]] routes for natural gas and from obligations on extensive short-term external [[debt]]. At the same time, however, the value of total exports has risen sharply because of increases in international oil and gas prices. Economic prospects in the near future are discouraging because of widespread internal [[poverty]] and the burden of foreign debt. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

President Niyazov spent much of the country's revenue on extensively renovating cities, Ashgabat in particular. Corruption watchdogs voiced particular concern over the management of Turkmenistan's currency reserves, most of which are held in off-budget funds such as the Foreign Exchange Reserve Fund in the Deutsche Bank in [[Frankfurt]], according to a report released in April 2006 by London-based non-governmental organization [[Global Witness]].

Drivers of buses, lorries and tractors could get 200 litres of fuel and motorcyclists and scooter riders 40 litres free. On 5 September 2006, after Turkmenistan threatened to cut off supplies, Russia agreed to raise the price it pays for Turkmen natural gas from $65 to $100 per 1,000 cubic meters. Two-thirds of Turkmen gas goes through the Russian [[State-owned enterprise|state-owned]] [[Gazprom]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5314940.stm |title=Business &#124; Russia reaches Turkmen gas deal |publisher=BBC News |date=5 September 2006 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

On 21 May 2010, president [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]] unexpectedly signed a decree stating that companies from Turkmenistan will build an internal East-West gas pipeline allowing the transfer of gas from the biggest deposits in Turkmenistan (Dowlatabad and Yoloten) to the Caspian coast. The East-West pipeline is planned to be 773-kilometre (483-mile) long and have a carrying capacity of 30 bn m³ annually, at a cost of between one and one and a half billion US dollars.<ref name="europarussia.com" /> The Trans-Caspian pipeline (TCP) project, backed by the European Union, has so far remained on paper, partly due to disputes about the Caspian Sea's legal status and Turkmenistan's refusal to sign production-sharing agreements with foreign companies for major [[hydrocarbon]] deposits.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Turkmenistan boosts gas export capacity with East-West link|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/turkmenistan-pipeline-idUSL8N14C0GT20151223|publisher=Reuters.com |date=23 December 2015|newspaper=Reuters}}</ref>

=== Oil ===
Most of Turkmenistan's oil is extracted by the Turkmenistan State Company (Concern) [[Türkmennebit]] from fields at Koturdepe, [[Balkanabat]], and [[Hazar, Turkmenistan|Cheleken]] near the Caspian Sea, which have a combined estimated reserve of 700 million tons. The oil extraction industry started with the exploitation of the fields in Cheleken in 1909 (by [[Branobel]]) and in Balkanabat in the 1930s. Production leaped ahead with the discovery of the Kumdag field in 1948 and the Koturdepe field in 1959. A big part of the oil produced in Turkmenistan is refined in Turkmenbashy and Seidi refineries. Also, oil is exported by tankers through the Caspian Sea to Europe via canals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://turkmenistanoil.tripod.com/id4.html |title=Turkmenistan Oil and Gas |publisher=Turkmenistanoil.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref>

Turkmenistan is a net exporter of electrical power to Central Asian republics and southern neighbors. The most important generating installations are the Hindukush Hydroelectric Station, which has a rated capacity of 350 megawatts, and the Mary Thermoelectric Power Station, which has a rated capacity of 1,370 megawatts. In 1992, electrical power production totaled 14.9 billion kilowatt-hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/turkmenistan/22.htm |title=Turkmenistan study |publisher=Countrystudies.us |date= |accessdate=25 November 2013}}</ref>

The first migrants were sent as [[Dawah|missionaries]] and often were adopted as patriarchs of particular clans or tribal groups, thereby becoming their "founders."

In the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, all religious beliefs were attacked by the communist authorities as superstition and "vestiges of the past." Most religious schooling and religious observance were banned, and the vast majority of mosques were closed. However, since 1990, efforts have been made to regain some of the cultural heritage lost under Soviet rule.

Former president [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] ordered that basic Islamic principles be taught in public schools.

President Niyazov wrote his own religious text, published in separate volumes in 2001 and 2004, entitled the [[Ruhnama]]. The Turkmenbashi regime required that the book, which formed the basis of the educational system in Turkmenistan, be given equal status with the Quran (mosques were required to display the two books side by side). The book was heavily promoted as part of the former president's personality cult, and knowledge of the Ruhnama is required even for obtaining a driver's license.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3528746.stm |title=Asia-Pacific &#124; Turkmen drivers face unusual test |publisher=BBC News |date=2 August 2004 |accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref>

Uruguay is home to an estimated {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Uruguay}}|,||}}/1e6 round 2}} million people,{{UN_Population|ref}} of whom 1.8 million live in the [[metropolitan area]] of its capital and largest city, [[Montevideo]].

Montevideo was founded as a military stronghold by the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] in the early 18th century, signifying the competing claims over the region. Uruguay won its independence between 1811 and 1828, following a four-way struggle between Spain, Portugal, and later Argentina and Brazil. It remained subject to foreign influence and intervention throughout the 19th century, with the military playing a recurring role in domestic politics.

A series of economic crises put an end to a democratic period that had begun in the early 20th century, culminating in a [[1973 Uruguayan coup d'état|1973 coup]], which established a [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|civic-military dictatorship]]. The military government persecuted leftists, socialists, and political opponents, resulting in several deaths and numerous instances of [[torture]] by the military; the military relinquished power to a civilian government in 1985. Uruguay is today a [[democracy|democratic]] constitutional republic, with a president who serves as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]].

==Etymology==<!--linked-->

The name of [[Uruguay River|the namesake river]] comes from the Spanish pronunciation of the regional [[Guarani languages|Guarani]] word for it. There are several interpretations, including "bird-river" ("the river of the ''{{lang|gn|urú}}''", via [[Charruan languages|Charruan]], ''{{lang|gn|urú}}'' being a [[common noun]] of any wild fowl).<ref>{{cite book|title=Revista Del Río de La Plata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mOexAAAAIAAJ|year=1971|page=285|quote=The word itself, "Uruguay," is clearly derived from the Guaraní, probably by way of the tribal dialect of the [[Charrúa]]s […] from ''uru'' (a generic designation of wild fowl)}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Nordenskiöld|first=Erland|authorlink=Erland Nordenskiöld|title=Deductions suggested by the geographical distribution of some post-Columbian words used by the Indians of S.

''{{lang|gn|Uruguaçu}}'' means "the big ''{{lang|gn|uru}}''".}}</ref>
The name could also refer to a river snail called ''{{lang|gn|uruguá}}'' (''[[Pomella (gastropod)|Pomella]] megastoma'') that was plentiful in the water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/101008/pciuda-520474/informe/presentan-tesis-del-nombre-uruguay/ |work=[[El País]] |title=Presentan tesis del nombre Uruguay |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314100414/http://www.elpais.com.uy/101008/pciuda-520474/informe/presentan-tesis-del-nombre-uruguay/ |archive-date=14 March 2012 |language=Spanish|access-date=21 November 2014}}</ref>

In Spanish colonial times, and for some time thereafter, Uruguay and some neighbouring territories were called the [[Cisplatina]] and ''{{lang|es|[[Banda Oriental]] [del Uruguay]}}'' ("East Bank [of the Uruguay River]"), then for a few years the "Eastern Province". Since its independence, the country has been known as ''{{lang|es|la República Oriental del Uruguay}}'', which literally means "the eastern republic of the Uruguay [River]". However, it is commonly translated either as the "Oriental Republic of Uruguay"<ref name=CIA/><ref name="britannica">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/620116/Uruguay|title=Uruguay|accessdate=2 September 2008|year=2008|work=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> or the "Eastern Republic of Uruguay".<ref>"Eastern Republic of Uruguay" is the official name used in many [[United Nations]] publications in English, e.g. {{cite book|title=Treaty Series|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_4bp3hF2DfMC&pg=RA1-PA118|year=1991|publisher=UN Publications|isbn=978-92-1-900187-9}} & in some formal UK documents, e.g. {{cite book|title=Agreement Between the European Community and the Eastern Republic of Uruguay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_34BywAACAAJ|year=1974|publisher=[[H.M.

==History==
{{Main|History of Uruguay}}
The documented inhabitants of Uruguay before [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]] of the area were the [[Charrúa]], a small tribe driven south by the [[Guarani people|Guarani]] of [[Paraguay]].<ref name="dept-state">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2091.htm|title= Background Note: Uruguay|author=Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2017}} It is estimated that there were about 9,000 Charrúa and 6,000 Chaná and Guaraní at the time of contact with Europeans in the 1500s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh1fdSd5n-0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=uruguay+by+leslie+jermyn&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq0c-GyczPAhUFoZQKHY9EAhIQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Uruguay|first=Leslie|last=Jermyn|date=1 October 1998|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|via=Google Books}}</ref> Fructuoso Rivera - Uruguay's first president – organized the Charruas' genocide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theprisma.co.uk/2011/03/28/uruguay-and-the-memory-of-the-charrua/|title=Uruguay and the memory of the Charrúa tribe – ThePrisma.co.uk|website=theprisma.co.uk|language=en-US|access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref>

In 1603, the Spanish began to introduce cattle, which became a source of wealth in the region. The first permanent Spanish settlement was founded in 1624 at [[Villa Soriano|Soriano]] on the [[Río Negro (Uruguay)|Río Negro]]. In 1669–71, the Portuguese built a fort at [[Colonia del Sacramento]].

[[Montevideo]] was founded by the Spanish in the early 18th century as a military stronghold in the country. Its natural harbor soon developed into a commercial area competing with [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]]'s capital, [[Buenos Aires]].<ref name="dept-state"/> Uruguay's early 19th century history was shaped by ongoing fights for dominance in the [[La Plata Basin|Platine region]],<ref name="dept-state"/> between British, Spanish, Portuguese and other colonial forces. In 1806 and 1807, the [[British invasions of the Río de la Plata|British army attempted to seize Buenos Aires and Montevideo]] as part of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Montevideo was occupied by a British force from February to September 1807.

[[File:Juan Manuel Blanes - El Juramento de los Treinta y Tres Orientales.jpg|thumb|250px|The oath of the [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] by Uruguayan painter [[Juan Manuel Blanes]]]]

In 1811, [[José Gervasio Artigas]], who became Uruguay's national hero, launched a successful revolt against the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Spanish authorities]], defeating them on 18 May at the [[Battle of Las Piedras (1811)|Battle of Las Piedras]].<ref name="dept-state"/>

In 1813, the new government in Buenos Aires convened a constituent assembly where Artigas emerged as a champion of federalism, demanding political and economic autonomy for each area, and for the [[Banda Oriental]] in particular.<ref name="loc-3">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/3.htm|title=THE STRUGGLE FOR INDEPENDENCE, 1811–30&nbsp;– Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The assembly refused to seat the delegates from the Banda Oriental, however, and Buenos Aires pursued a system based on unitary centralism.<ref name="loc-3"/>

As a result, Artigas broke with Buenos Aires and besieged Montevideo, taking the city in early 1815.<ref name="loc-3"/> Once the troops from Buenos Aires had withdrawn, the Banda Oriental appointed its first autonomous government.<ref name="loc-3"/> Artigas organized the [[Liga Federal|Federal League]] under his protection, consisting of six provinces, four of which later became part of Argentina.<ref name="loc-3"/>

In 1816, a force of 10,000 Portuguese troops invaded the Banda Oriental from Brazil; they took Montevideo in January 1817.<ref name="loc-3"/> After nearly four more years of struggle, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]] annexed the ''Banda Oriental'' as a province under the name of "[[Cisplatina]]".<ref name="loc-3"/> The [[Empire of Brazil|Brazilian Empire]] became independent of Portugal in 1822. In response to the annexation, the [[Thirty-Three Orientals]], led by [[Juan Antonio Lavalleja]], declared independence on 25 August 1825 supported by the [[United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]] (present-day Argentina).<ref name="dept-state"/> This led to the 500-day-long [[Cisplatine War]]. Neither side gained the upper hand and in 1828 the [[Treaty of Montevideo (1828)|Treaty of Montevideo]], fostered by the United Kingdom through the diplomatic efforts of [[John Ponsonby, 1st Viscount Ponsonby|Viscount John Ponsonby]], gave birth to Uruguay as an independent state. 25 August is celebrated as Independence Day, a [[Public holidays in Uruguay|national holiday]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.elobservador.com.uy/google-homenajea-uruguay-el-dia-la-independencia-n231109 |title=Google homenajea a Uruguay |date=25 August 2012 |work=[[El Observador (Uruguay)|El Observador]] |access-date=23 August 2018 |language=es-uy }}</ref> The nation's [[Constitution of Uruguay|first constitution]] was adopted on 18 July 1830.<ref name="dept-state"/>

===Blancos–Colorados conflicts===
{{Further|Uruguayan Civil War}}
[[File:Manuel Oribe por Rose.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Manuel Oribe]], leader of Blancos]]

At the time of independence, Uruguay had an estimated population of just under 75,000.<ref name="loc-5">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/5.htm|title=BEGINNINGS OF INDEPENDENT LIFE, 1830–52&nbsp;– Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The era from independence until 1904 was marked by regular military conflicts and civil wars between the Blanco and Colorado Parties. The political scene in Uruguay became split between two parties: the conservative [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]] (Whites) headed by the second President [[Manuel Oribe]], representing the agricultural interests of the countryside; and the liberal [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados]] (Reds) led by the first President [[Fructuoso Rivera]], representing the business interests of Montevideo. The Uruguayan parties received support from warring political factions in neighbouring [[Argentina]], which became involved in Uruguayan affairs.

The Colorados favored the exiled Argentine liberal [[Unitarian Party|Unitarios]], many of whom had taken refuge in Montevideo while the Blanco president Manuel Oribe was a close friend of the Argentine ruler [[Manuel de Rosas]]. On 15 June 1838, an army led by the Colorado leader Rivera overthrew President Oribe, who fled to Argentina.<ref name="loc-5"/> Rivera declared war on Rosas in 1839. The conflict would last 13 years and become known as the [[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]] (the Great War).<ref name="loc-5"/>

In 1843, an Argentine army overran Uruguay on Oribe's behalf but failed to take the capital. The [[Uruguayan Civil War#The Great Siege|siege of Montevideo]], which began in February 1843, would last nine years.<ref name="loc-6">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/6.htm|title=The Great War, 1843–52 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The besieged Uruguayans called on resident foreigners for help, which led to a French and an Italian legion being formed, the latter led by the exiled [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]].<ref name="loc-6"/>
[[File:Caseros.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Caseros]], 1852]]
In 1845, Britain and France intervened against Rosas to restore commerce to normal levels in the region. Their efforts proved ineffective and, by 1849, tired of the war, both withdrew after signing a treaty favorable to Rosas.<ref name="loc-6"/> It appeared that Montevideo would finally fall when an uprising against Rosas, led by [[Justo José de Urquiza]], governor of Argentina's [[Entre Ríos Province]], began. The Brazilian intervention in May 1851 on behalf of the Colorados, combined with the uprising, changed the situation and Oribe was defeated. The siege of Montevideo was lifted and the Guerra Grande finally came to an end.<ref name="loc-6"/> Montevideo rewarded Brazil's support by signing treaties that confirmed Brazil's right to intervene in Uruguay's internal affairs.<ref name="loc-6"/>

In accordance with the 1851 treaties, Brazil intervened militarily in Uruguay as often as it deemed necessary.<ref name="loc-7">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/7.htm|title=THE STRUGGLE FOR SURVIVAL, 1852–75 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> In 1865, the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] was formed by the [[emperor of Brazil]], the [[president of Argentina]], and the Colorado general [[Venancio Flores]], the Uruguayan head of government whom they both had helped to gain power. The Triple Alliance declared war on the Paraguayan leader [[Francisco Solano López]]<ref name="loc-7"/> and the resulting [[Paraguayan War]] ended with the invasion of Paraguay and its defeat by the armies of the three countries. Montevideo, which was used as a supply station by the Brazilian navy, experienced a period of prosperity and relative calm during the war.<ref name="loc-7"/>

The constitutional government of General [[Lorenzo Batlle y Grau]] (1868–72) suppressed the [[Revolution of the Lances]] by the [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]].<ref name="loc-9"/> After two years of struggle, a peace agreement was signed in 1872 that gave the Blancos a share in the emoluments and functions of government, through control of four of the [[departments of Uruguay]].<ref name="loc-9">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/9.htm|title=Caudillos and Political Stability – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> [[File:Tuyuti1.jpg|thumb|left|Uruguayan troops entrenched in the [[Battle of Tuyutí]], 1866]] This establishment of the policy of co-participation represented the search for a new formula of compromise, based on the coexistence of the party in power and the party in opposition.<ref name="loc-9"/>

Despite this agreement, Colorado rule was threatened by the failed Tricolor Revolution in 1875 and Revolution of the [[Quebracho, Uruguay|Quebracho]] in 1886.

The Colorado effort to reduce Blancos to only three departments caused a Blanco uprising of 1897, which ended with the creation of 16 departments, of which the Blancos now had control over six. Blancos were given ⅓ of seats in Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LAvw-YXm4TsC&pg=PA85&dq=co-participation%20uruguay#v=onepage&q=co-participation%20uruguay&f=true|title=Authoritarian Regimes in Latin America: Dictators, Despots, and Tyrants|first=Paul H.|last=Lewis|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|via=Google Books}}</ref> This division of power lasted until the President [[Jose Batlle y Ordonez]] instituted his political reforms which caused the last uprising by Blancos in 1904 that ended with the [[Battle of Masoller]] and the death of Blanco leader [[Aparicio Saravia]].

Between 1875 and 1890, the military became the center of power.<ref name="loc-10">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/10.htm|title=MODERN URUGUAY, 1875–1903 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> During this authoritarian period, the government took steps toward the organization of the country as a modern state, encouraging its economic and social transformation. Pressure groups (consisting mainly of businessmen, ''[[hacendado]]s'', and industrialists) were organized and had a strong influence on government.<ref name="loc-10"/> A transition period (1886–90) followed, during which politicians began recovering lost ground and some civilian participation in government occurred.<ref name="loc-10"/>

====Mass immigration and development====
{{Main|Immigration to Uruguay}}
[[File:Idiarte borda.jpg|thumb|[[Juan Idiarte Borda]] (1844–1897), 17th [[President of Uruguay]] and the only one assassinated]]

After the [[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]], there was a sharp rise in the number of [[immigration|immigrants]], primarily from Italy and Spain. By 1879, the total population of the country was over 438,500.<ref name="loc-8">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/8.htm|title=Evolution of the Economy and Society – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The economy reflected a steep upswing (if demonstrated graphically, above all other related economic determinants), in livestock raising and exports.<ref name="loc-8"/> Montevideo became a major economic center of the region and an [[entrepôt]] for goods from Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay.<ref name="loc-8"/>

===20th century===
The Colorado leader [[José Batlle y Ordóñez]] was elected president in 1903.<ref name="loc-12">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/12.htm|title=THE NEW COUNTRY, 1903–33 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The following year, the Blancos led a rural revolt and eight bloody months of fighting ensued before their leader, [[Aparicio Saravia]], was killed in battle. Government forces emerged victorious, leading to the end of the co-participation politics that had begun in 1872.<ref name="loc-12"/> [[José Batlle y Ordóñez|Batlle]] had two terms (1903–07 and 1911–15) during which, taking advantage of the nation's stability and growing economic prosperity, he instituted major reforms, such as a welfare program, government participation in many facets of the economy, and a plural executive.<ref name="dept-state"/>

[[Gabriel Terra]] became president in March 1931. His inauguration coincided with the effects of the [[Great Depression]],<ref name="loc-14">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/14.htm|title=THE CONSERVATIVE ADJUSTMENT, 1931–43 – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> and the social climate became tense as a result of the lack of jobs. There were confrontations in which police and leftists died.<ref name="loc-14"/> In 1933, Terra organized a coup d'état, dissolving the General Assembly and governing by decree.<ref name="loc-14"/> A new constitution was promulgated in 1934, transferring powers to the president.<ref name="loc-14"/> In general, the Terra government weakened or neutralized economic nationalism and social reform.<ref name="loc-14"/>

In 1938, general elections were held and Terra's brother-in-law, General [[Alfredo Baldomir]], was elected president. Under pressure from organized labor and the National Party, Baldomir advocated free elections, freedom of the press, and a new constitution.<ref name="loc-15">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/15.htm|title=Baldomir and the End of Dictatorship – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> Although Baldomir declared Uruguay neutral in 1939, British warships and the German ship {{ship|German cruiser|Admiral Graf Spee||2}} fought [[Battle of the River Plate|a battle]] not far off Uruguay's coast.<ref name="loc-15"/> The ''Admiral Graf Spee'' took refuge in [[Montevideo]], claiming sanctuary in a neutral port, but was later ordered out.<ref name="loc-15"/>

In the late 1950s, partly because of a worldwide decrease in demand for Uruguyan agricultural products, Uruguayans suffered from a steep drop in their standard of living, which led to student militancy and labor unrest. An armed group, known as the [[Tupamaros]] emerged in the 1960s, engaging in activities such as bank robbery, kidnapping and assassination, in addition to attempting an overthrow of the government.

===Civic-military regime===
President [[Jorge Pacheco Areco|Jorge Pacheco]] declared a state of emergency in 1968, followed by a further suspension of civil liberties in 1972. In 1973, amid increasing economic and political turmoil, the armed forces, asked by the President [[Juan María Bordaberry]], closed the Congress and established a [[Civic-military dictatorship of Uruguay|civilian-military regime]].<ref name="dept-state"/> Uruguay actively participated in [[Operation Condor]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dinges |first1=John |title=Operation Condor |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/chile/operation-condor.htm |website=latinamericanstudies.org |publisher=Columbia University}}</ref> Around 200 Uruguayans are known to have been killed and disappeared, with hundreds more illegally detained and tortured during the 12-year civil-military rule of 1973 to 1985.<ref>{{cite news|title=New find in Uruguay 'missing' dig|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4494286.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 February 2011|date=3 December 2005}}</ref> Most were killed in Argentina and other neighboring countries, with 36 of them having been killed in Uruguay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Uruguay dig finds 'disappeared'.|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4485288.stm|quote=|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 February 2011|date=30 November 2005}}</ref>

====Return to democracy (1984–present)====
[[File:Batlle1.jpg|thumb|left|Uruguayan president [[Jorge Batlle]] with former U.S. president [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2003]]

A new constitution, drafted by the military, was rejected in a November 1980 referendum.<ref name="dept-state"/> Following the referendum, the armed forces announced a plan for the return to civilian rule, and national elections were held in 1984.<ref name="dept-state"/> [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorado Party]] leader [[Julio María Sanguinetti]] won the presidency and served from 1985 to 1990. The first Sanguinetti administration implemented economic reforms and consolidated democracy following the country's years under military rule.<ref name="dept-state"/>

The National Party's [[Luis Alberto Lacalle]] won the 1989 presidential election and amnesty for human rights abusers was endorsed by referendum. Sanguinetti was then re-elected in 1994.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1229362.stm|title=Uruguay timeline|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=12 April 2011}}</ref> Both presidents continued the economic structural reforms initiated after the reinstatement of democracy and other important reforms were aimed at improving the electoral system, social security, education, and public safety.[[File:Actividades conmemorativas de las Instrucciones Año XIII 22.jpg|thumbnail|Bicentennial celebrations in 2011. The image shows 500 school children from 19 schools across the country gathered at the Palacio Legislativo.]]The 1999 national elections were held under a new electoral system established by a 1996 constitutional amendment. Colorado Party candidate [[Jorge Batlle]], aided by the support of the National Party, defeated [[Broad Front (Uruguay)|Broad Front]] candidate [[Tabaré Vázquez]]. The formal coalition ended in November 2002, when the Blancos withdrew their ministers from the cabinet,<ref name="dept-state" /> although the Blancos continued to support the Colorados on most issues. Low commodity prices and economic difficulties in Uruguay's main export markets (starting in Brazil with the devaluation of the [[Brazilian real|real]], then in [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|Argentina in 2002]]), caused a severe recession; the economy contracted by 11%, unemployment climbed to 21%, and the percentage of Uruguayans in poverty rose to over 30%.<ref name="cong-r" />
In 2004, Uruguayans elected Tabaré Vázquez as president, while giving the Broad Front a majority in both houses of Parliament. Vázquez stuck to economic orthodoxy. As commodity prices soared and the economy recovered from the recession, he tripled foreign investment, cut poverty and unemployment, cut public debt from 79% of GDP to 60%, and kept inflation steady.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/14700728|title=The mystery behind Mujica's mask|date=22 October 2009|work=The Economist|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref>

In 2009, [[José Mujica]], a former left-wing guerrilla leader (Tupamaros) who spent almost 15 years in prison during the country's military rule, emerged as the new President as the Broad Front won the election for a second time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8385092.stm|title=Uruguay elects José Mujica as president, polls show|date=30 November 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 February 2011|first=Candace|last=Piette}}</ref> [[Abortion in Uruguay|Abortion]] was legalized in 2012, followed by [[Same-sex marriage in Uruguay|same-sex marriage]] and [[Legality of cannabis in Uruguay|cannabis]] in the following year.

Uruguay experienced a major economic and financial crisis between 1999 and 2002, principally a [[spillover effect]] from the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999–2002)|economic problems of Argentina]].<ref name="cong-r"/> The economy contracted by 11%, and unemployment climbed to 21%.<ref name="cong-r"/> Despite the severity of the trade shocks, Uruguay's financial indicators remained more stable than those of its neighbours, a reflection of its solid reputation among investors and its [[investment-grade]] [[sovereign bond]] rating, one of only two in South America.<ref>[http://gosouthamerica.about.com/library/blUrurfactpage.htm About.com: Go South America], based on information from the [[CIA World Factbook]].</ref>{{update after|2011|10|03}}

In 2004, the Batlle government signed a three-year $1.1 billion stand-by arrangement with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), committing the country to a substantial [[primary surplus|primary fiscal surplus]], low inflation, considerable reductions in external debt, and several [[structural reforms]] designed to improve competitiveness and attract [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]].<ref name="cong-r"/> Uruguay terminated the agreement in 2006 following the early repayment of its debt but maintained a number of the policy commitments.<ref name="cong-r"/>

Vázquez, who assumed the government in March 2005, created the "Ministry of Social Development" and sought to reduce the country's poverty rate with a $240 million National Plan to Address the Social Emergency (PANES), which provided a monthly [[conditional cash transfer]] of approximately $75 to over 100,000 households in extreme poverty.

Cultural experiences in Uruguay include exploring the country's colonial heritage, as found in [[Colonia del Sacramento]].

Historical monuments such as [[Torres Garcia Museum]] as well as [[Estadio Centenario]], which housed the first world cup in history, are examples. However simply walking the streets allows tourists to experience the city's colorful culture.

One of the main natural attractions in Uruguay is [[Punta del Este]]. Punta del Este is situated on a small peninsula off the southeast coast of Uruguay. Its beaches are divided into Mansa, or tame (river) side and Brava, or rugged (ocean) side. The Mansa is more suited for sunbathing, snorkeling, & other low-key recreational opportunities, while the Brava is more suited for adventurous sports, such as surfing. Punta del Este adjoins the city of Maldonado, while to its northeast along the coast are found the smaller resorts of La Barra and José Ignacio.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/09/travel/09next.html|title=José Ignacio, an Uruguayan Resort Town That’s Chic, but So Far Not Famous|first=Paola|last=Singer|date=6 November 2008|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

The system is government owned, and there have been controversial proposals to partially privatize since the 1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1992/10/02/Uruguay-privatization-scheme-jolted-by-opposition/8141717998400/|title=Uruguay privatization scheme jolted by opposition|website=UPI|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>

Uruguayans are of predominantly European origin, with over 87.7% of the population claiming [[European ethnic groups|European descent]] in the 2011 census.<ref name=enha_asc/>
Most Uruguayans of European ancestry are descendants of 19th and 20th century immigrants from Spain and Italy (about one-quarter of the population is of Italian origin),<ref name="dept-state"/> and to a lesser degree France, Germany and Britain.<ref name="britannica"/> Earlier settlers had migrated from Argentina.<ref name="britannica"/> People of African descent make up an even smaller proportion of the total.<ref name="britannica"/>

From 1963 to 1985, an estimated 320,000 Uruguayans emigrated.<ref name="loc-30">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/uruguay/30.htm|title=Population – Uruguay|publisher=Library of Congress Country Studies|accessdate=23 February 2011}}</ref> The most popular destinations for Uruguayan emigrants are Argentina, followed by the United States, Australia, Canada, Spain, Italy and France.<ref name="loc-30"/> In 2009, for the first time in 44 years, the country saw an overall positive influx when comparing immigration to emigration. 3,825 residence permits were awarded in 2009, compared with 1,216 in 2005.<ref name="bbc-secret"/> 50% of new legal residents come from Argentina and Brazil. A migration law passed in 2008 gives immigrants the same rights and opportunities that nationals have, with the requisite of proving a monthly income of $650.<ref name="bbc-secret">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-11397130|title=Uruguay: South America's best-kept secret?|date=3 October 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 February 2011}}</ref>

Uruguay's rate of population growth is much lower than in other Latin American countries.<ref name="britannica"/> Its median age is higher than the global average<ref name="dept-state"/> due to its low birth rate, high life expectancy, and relatively high rate of emigration among younger people. A quarter of the population is less than 15 years old and about a sixth are aged 60 and older.<ref name="britannica"/>

Metropolitan Montevideo is the only large city, with around 1.9 million inhabitants, or more than half the country's total population. The rest of the urban population lives in about 30 towns.<ref name="dept-state"/>

A 2017 [[Inter-American Development Bank|IADB]] report on labor conditions for Latin American nations, ranked Uruguay as the region's leader overall and in all but one subindexes, including gender, age, income, formality and labor participation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Better Jobs|url=https://mejorestrabajos.iadb.org/en|publisher=IADB|accessdate=9 November 2017}}</ref>

===Language===
{{Main|Rioplatense Spanish}}
[[Uruguayan Spanish]] has some modifications due to the considerable number of [[Italian Uruguayan|Italian immigrants]]. Immigrants used to speak a mixture of Spanish and Italian known as '[[cocoliche]]' and some of the words are still commonly used by the population. As is the case with neighboring Argentina, Uruguay employs both [[voseo]] and [[yeísmo]] (with {{IPA|[ʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʒ]}}). English is common in the business world and its study has risen significantly in recent years, especially among the young. [[Uruguayan Portuguese]] is spoken as a native language by 15% of the Uruguayan population, in northern regions near the Brazilian border,<ref>[https://pgl.gal/situacao-atual-do-portugues-do-uruguai/ The Portuguese Dialect of Uruguay (DPU) is spoken by circa 15% of the Uruguayan population according to Juan Pedro Mir, director of education of the Ministry of Education and Culture of the country]. pgl.gal (19 August 2017)</ref> making it the second most spoken language of the country.

Another spoken dialect was the [[Patois]], which was a mixture of French and Italian. The dialect was spoken mainly in the [[Colonia Department]], where the first pilgrims settled, in the city called [[La Paz (Colonia)]]. Today it is considered a dead tongue, although some elders at the aforementioned location still practice it. There are still written tracts of the language in the [[Waldensians]] Library (Biblioteca Valdense) in the town of [[Colonia Valdense]], [[Colonia Department]].
[[Patois]] speakers arrived to Uruguay from the [[Piedmont]]. Originally they were Vaudois, who become [[Waldensians]], giving their name to the city Colonia Valdense, which translated from the Spanish means "Waldensian Colony."<ref>{{cite book|url=http://dedicaciontotal.udelar.edu.uy/adjuntos/produccion/742_academicas__academicaarchivo.pdf |title=Etnicidad y Lenguaje – La aculturación socio lingüística de los inmigrantes italianos en Montevideo |author=Graciela Barrios |publisher=Departamento de Publicaciones de la Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educación Universidad de la República |date=2008 |accessdate=21 April 2017}}</ref>

Uruguayan culture is strongly European and its influences from southern Europe are particularly important.<ref name="britannica"/> The tradition of the [[gaucho]] has been an important element in the art and folklore of both Uruguay and Argentina.<ref name="britannica"/>

===Visual arts===
[[File:Casapueblo.jpg|thumb|A "livable sculpture", [[Carlos Páez Vilaró]]'s [[Casapueblo]] was his home, hotel and museum.]]
Abstract painter and sculptor [[Carlos Páez Vilaró]] was a prominent Uruguayan artist. He drew from both [[Timbuktu]] and [[Mykonos]] to create his best-known work: his home, hotel and [[atelier]] [[Casapueblo]] near [[Punta del Este]]. Casapueblo is a "livable sculpture" and draws thousands of visitors from around the world. The 19th-century painter [[Juan Manuel Blanes]], whose works depict historical events, was the first Uruguayan artist to gain widespread recognition.<ref name="britannica"/> The [[Post-Impressionist]] painter [[Pedro Figari]] achieved international renown for his pastel studies of subjects in Montevideo and the countryside. Blending elements of art and nature the work of the landscape architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Leandro Silva Delgado|es}} has also earned international prominence.<ref name="britannica"/>

Uruguay has a small but growing film industry, and movies such as ''[[Whisky (film)|Whisky]]'' by [[Juan Pablo Rebella]] and [[Pablo Stoll]] (2004), [[Marcelo Bertalmío]]'s ''Los días con Ana'' (2000; "Days with Ana") and [[Ana Díez]]'s ''[[Paisito]]'' (2008), about the 1973 military coup, have earned international honours.<ref name="britannica"/>

The folk and popular music of Uruguay shares not only its [[gaucho]] roots with [[Argentina]], but also those of the [[tango (music)|tango]].<ref name="britannica"/> One of the most famous tangos, "[[La cumparsita]]" (1917), was written by the Uruguayan composer [[Gerardo Matos Rodríguez]].<ref name="britannica"/> The [[candombe]] is a folk dance performed at [[Carnival]], especially [[Uruguayan Carnival]], mainly by Uruguayans of African ancestry.<ref name="britannica"/> The guitar is the preferred musical instrument, and in a popular traditional contest called the ''payada'' two singers, each with a guitar, take turns improvising verses to the same tune.<ref name="britannica"/>

Folk music is called [[canto popular]] and includes some guitar players and singers such as [[Alfredo Zitarrosa]], [[José Carbajal (Uruguayan musician)|José Carbajal "El Sabalero"]], [[Daniel Viglietti]], [[Los Olimareños]], and [[Numa Moraes]].

Numerous radio stations and musical events reflect the popularity of rock music and the Caribbean genres, known as ''música tropical'' ("tropical music").<ref name="britannica"/> Early classical music in Uruguay showed heavy Spanish and Italian influence, but since the 20th century a number of composers of classical music, including [[Eduardo Fabini]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Vicente Ascone|es}}, and [[Héctor Tosar]], have made use of Latin American musical idioms.<ref name="britannica"/>

[[Tango]] has also affected Uruguayan culture, especially during the 20th century, particularly the '30s and '40s with Uruguayan singers such as [[Julio Sosa]] from [[Las Piedras, Uruguay|Las Piedras]].<ref name=UNESCO>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hy8EQ1hEp3BVG-vnlwrClzXfpA7A |title=Argentina, Uruguay bury hatchet to snatch tango honor |last=Termine |first=Laura |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=2 April 2010 |location=Buenos Aires |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011083629/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hy8EQ1hEp3BVG-vnlwrClzXfpA7A |archivedate=11 October 2009}}</ref> When the famous tango singer [[Carlos Gardel]] was 29 years old he changed his nationality to be Uruguayan, saying he was born in [[Tacuarembó]], but this subterfuge was probably done to keep French authorities from arresting him for failing to register in the French Army for [[World War I]].

[[Rock and roll]] first broke into Uruguayan audiences with the arrival of [[the Beatles]] and other British bands in the early 1960s.

===Literature===
{{Main|Uruguayan literature}}
[[File:José Enrique Rodó.jpg|thumb|[[José Enrique Rodó]]]]
[[José Enrique Rodó]] (1871–1917), a modernist, is considered Uruguay's most significant literary figure.<ref name="britannica"/> His book ''Ariel'' (1900) deals with the need to maintain [[spirituality|spiritual]] values while pursuing material and technical progress.<ref name="britannica"/> Besides stressing the importance of upholding spiritual over materialistic values, it also stresses resisting cultural dominance by Europe and the United States.<ref name="britannica"/> The book continues to influence young writers.<ref name="britannica"/> Notable amongst Latin American playwrights is [[Florencio Sánchez]] (1875–1910), who wrote plays about contemporary social problems that are still performed today.<ref name="britannica"/>

From about the same period came the romantic poetry of [[Juan Zorrilla de San Martín]] (1855–1931), who wrote epic poems about [[History of Uruguay|Uruguayan history]]. Also notable are [[Juana de Ibarbourou]] (1895–1979), [[Delmira Agustini]] (1866–1914), [[Idea Vilariño]] (1920–2009), and the short stories of [[Horacio Quiroga]] and [[Juan José Morosoli]] (1899–1959).<ref name="britannica"/> The psychological stories of [[Juan Carlos Onetti]] (such as "No Man's Land" and "The Shipyard") have earned widespread critical praise, as have the writings of [[Mario Benedetti]].<ref name="britannica"/>

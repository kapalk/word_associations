Tensions between the regions of Tripolitania in the west, Cyrenaica in the east, and Fezzan to the south are ever-present. To those is added Tripoli now being under the control of Libyan Dawn, with the newly elected government decamping to the city of Tobruk in Cyrenaica. Some in Cyrenaica think separation is the answer, noting that the region contains two-thirds of the oil of Libya, which holds the largest reserves in Africa. The government itself is determined to reconnect with the rest of the country, but it lacks the armed forces to take back Tripoli, making de-facto partition the present reality."

Libya has been inhabited by [[Berber people|Berbers]] since the late [[Bronze Age]]. The [[Phoenicia]]ns established trading posts in western Libya, and ancient [[Greek colonies|Greek colonists]] established city-states in eastern Libya. Libya was variously ruled by [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]], [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egyptians]] and [[Macedonian Empire|Greeks]] before becoming a part of the [[Roman Empire]]. Libya was an [[Early centers of Christianity|early centre of Christianity]]. After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the area of Libya was mostly occupied by the [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] until the 7th century, when [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|invasions]] brought [[Islam]] to the region. In the 16th century, the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Knights of St John]] occupied [[Tripoli]], until [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule [[Ottoman Tripolitania|began in 1551]]. Libya was involved in the [[Barbary Wars]] of the 18th and 19th centuries. Ottoman rule continued until the [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] occupation of Libya resulted in the temporary [[Italian Libya]] colony from 1911 to 1947. During the [[Second World War]], Libya was an important area of warfare in the [[North African Campaign]]. The [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian population]] then went into decline.

The coastal plain of Libya was inhabited by [[Neolithic]] peoples from as early as 8000 BC. The [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] ancestors of the [[Berber people]] are assumed to have spread into the area by the [[Late Bronze Age]]. The earliest known name of such a tribe was the [[Garamantes]], based in [[Germa]]. The [[Phoenicia]]ns were the first to establish trading posts in Libya.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.html |title=The Histories', Book IV.42–43 |publisher=Fordham University |date=August 1998 |author=Halsall, Paul |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409023843/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/herod-libya1.html |archivedate=9 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By the 5th century BC, the greatest of the Phoenician colonies, [[Carthage]], had extended its [[hegemony]] across much of North Africa, where a distinctive civilization, known as [[Punic]], came into being.

In 525 BC the [[Persian people|Persian]] army of [[Cambyses II]] overran Cyrenaica, which for the next two centuries remained under Persian or Egyptian rule. [[Alexander the Great]] was greeted by the Greeks when he entered Cyrenaica in 331 BC, and Eastern Libya again fell under the control of the Greeks, this time as part of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]].

After the fall of [[Carthage]] the Romans did not immediately occupy [[Tripolitania]] (the region around Tripoli), but left it instead under control of the kings of [[Numidia]], until the coastal cities asked and obtained its protection.<ref name="be202">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 202.</ref> [[Ptolemy Apion]], the last Greek ruler, bequeathed Cyrenaica to Rome, which formally annexed the region in 74 BC and joined it to Crete as [[Creta et Cyrenaica|a Roman province]]. As part of the [[Africa Nova]] province, Tripolitania was prosperous,<ref name="be202" /> and reached a golden age in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, when the city of [[Leptis Magna]], home to the [[Severan dynasty]], was at its height.<ref name="be202" />

On the Eastern side, Cyrenaica's first Christian communities were established by the time of the Emperor [[Claudius]].<ref name="be417">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 417.</ref> It was heavily devastated during the [[Kitos War]]<ref name="ro364">{{cite book |ref=Rostovtzeff|last=Rostovtzeff|first=Michael|title=Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire|location=Oxford|year=1957|edition=2|publisher=Clarendon|page=364}}</ref> and almost depopulated of Greeks and Jews alike.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]], lxviii. 32</ref> Although repopulated by [[Trajan]] with military colonies,<ref name="ro364" /> from then started its decline.<ref name="be417" /> Libya was early to convert to [[Nicene Christianity]] and was the home of [[Pope Victor I]]; however, Libya was a hotbed for early heresies such as [[Arianism]] and [[Donatism]].

The decline of the [[Roman Empire]] saw the classical cities fall into ruin, a process hastened by the [[Vandals]]' destructive sweep through North Africa in the 5th century. When the Empire returned (now as [[Byzantine Empire|East Romans]]) as part of [[Justinian]]'s reconquests of the 6th century, efforts were made to strengthen the old cities, but it was only a last gasp before they collapsed into disuse. Cyrenaica, which had remained an outpost of the [[Byzantine Empire]] during the Vandal period, also took on the characteristics of an armed camp. Unpopular Byzantine governors imposed burdensome taxation to meet military costs, while the towns and public services—including the water system—were left to decay. By the beginning of the 7th century, Byzantine control over the region was weak, Berber rebellions were becoming more frequent, and there was little to oppose [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim]] invasion.<ref>Rodd, Francis (1925).

For the next several decades, Libya was under the purview of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Caliph of Damascus]] until the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] overthrew the Umayyads in 750, and Libya came under the rule of Baghdad. When Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] appointed [[Ibrahim I ibn al-Aghlab|Ibrahim ibn al-Aghlab]] as his governor of [[Ifriqiya]] in 800, Libya enjoyed considerable local autonomy under the [[Aghlabid]] dynasty. By the 10th century, the Shiite [[Fatimids]] controlled Western Libya, and ruled the entire region in 972 and appointed [[Bologhine ibn Ziri]] as governor.<ref name="be202" />

Ibn Ziri's Berber [[Zirid dynasty]] ultimately broke away from the Shiite Fatimids, and recognised the Sunni Abbasids of Baghdad as rightful Caliphs. In retaliation, the Fatimids brought about the migration of thousands from mainly two Arab Qaisi tribes, the [[Banu Sulaym]] and [[Banu Hilal]] to North Africa. This act drastically altered the fabric of the Libyan countryside, and cemented the cultural and linguistic Arabisation of the region.<ref name="be202" />

Zirid rule in Tripolitania was short-lived though, and already in 1001 the Berbers of the [[Banu Khazrun]] broke away. Tripolitania remained under their control until 1146, when the region was overtaken by the [[Normans of Sicily]].<ref name="be203">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 203.</ref> It was not until 1159 that the Moroccan [[Almohad]] leader [[Abd al-Mu'min]] reconquered Tripoli from European rule. For the next 50 years, Tripolitania was the scene of numerous battles among [[Ayyubids]], the Almohad rulers and insurgents of the [[Banu Ghaniya]]. Later, a general of the [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]], Muhammad ibn Abu Hafs, ruled Libya from 1207 to 1221 before the later establishment of a Tunisian [[Hafsid dynasty]]<ref name="be203" /> independent from the Almohads. The Hafsids ruled Tripolitania for nearly 300 years. By the 16th century the Hafsids became increasingly caught up in the power struggle between Spain and the [[Ottoman Empire]].

After weakening control of Abbasids, Cyrenaica was under Egypt based states such as [[Tulunids]], [[Ikhshidids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] before Ottoman conquest in 1517. Finally [[Fezzan]] acquired independence under Awlad Muhammad dynasty after [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] rule. Ottomans finally conquered Fezzan between 1556 and 1577.

===Ottoman Tripolitania (1551–1911)===
{{Main|Ottoman Tripolitania}}
[[File:Capture of Tripoli by the Ottomans 1551.jpg|thumb|The [[Siege of Tripoli (1551)|Siege of Tripoli]] in 1551 allowed the Ottomans to capture the city from the Knights of St. John.]]

After a successful invasion of Tripoli by [[Habsburg Spain]] in 1510,<ref name="be203" /> and its handover to the [[Knights of St. John]], the Ottoman admiral [[Sinan Pasha (Ottoman admiral)|Sinan Pasha]] took control of Libya in 1551.<ref name="be203" /> His successor [[Turgut Reis]] was named the [[Bey]] of Tripoli and later [[Pasha of Tripoli]] in 1556. By 1565, administrative authority as regent in Tripoli was vested in a ''[[pasha]]'' appointed directly by the ''[[sultan]]'' in [[Constantinople]]/[[Istanbul]]. In the 1580s, the rulers of [[Fezzan]] gave their allegiance to the sultan, and although Ottoman authority was absent in [[Cyrenaica]], a ''bey'' was stationed in Benghazi late in the next century to act as agent of the government in Tripoli.<ref name="be417" /> European [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]] and large numbers of enslaved Blacks transported from Sudan were also a feature of everyday life in Tripoli. In 1551, [[Turgut Reis]] enslaved almost the entire population of the Maltese island of [[Gozo]], some 5,000 people, sending them to Libya.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hoppen |first1=Alison |title=The fortification of Malta by the Order of St. John, 1530-1798 |date=1979 |publisher=Scottish Academic Press |page=25}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Robert C.

In time, real power came to rest with the pasha's corps of [[janissaries]].<ref name="be203" /> In 1611 the ''[[dey]]s'' staged a coup against the pasha, and Dey Sulayman Safar was appointed as head of government. For the next hundred years, a series of ''deys'' effectively ruled Tripolitania. The two most important Deys were [[Mehmed Saqizli]] (r. 1631–49) and [[Osman Saqizli]] (r. 1649–72), both also Pasha, who ruled effectively the region.<ref name="be204">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 204.</ref> The latter conquered also Cyrenaica.<ref name="be204" />

[[File:EnterpriseTripoli.jpg|thumb|left|The USS ''[[USS Enterprise (1799)|Enterprise]]'' of the [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]] capturing a Tripolitan Corsair during the [[First Barbary War]], 1801]]
Lacking direction from the Ottoman government, Tripoli lapsed into a period of military anarchy during which coup followed coup and few deys survived in office more than a year. One such coup was led by Turkish officer [[Ahmed Karamanli]].<ref name="be204" /> The [[Karamanli dynasty|Karamanlis]] ruled from 1711 until 1835 mainly in Tripolitania, and had influence in Cyrenaica and Fezzan as well by the mid-18th century. Ahmad's successors proved to be less capable than himself, however, the region's delicate balance of power allowed the Karamanli. The [[1793–95 Tripolitanian civil war]] occurred in those years. In 1793, [[Turkey|Turkish]] officer Ali Benghul deposed Hamet Karamanli and briefly restored Tripolitania to Ottoman rule. Hamet's brother [[Yusuf Karamanli|Yusuf]] (r. 1795–1832) re-established Tripolitania's independence.

[[File:NH 65536-KN.jpg|thumb|250px|A US Navy expedition under Commodore [[Edward Preble]] engaging gunboats and fortifications in [[Tripoli]], 1804]]
In the early 19th century war broke out between the United States and Tripolitania, and a series of battles ensued in what came to be known as the [[First Barbary War]] and the [[Second Barbary War]]. By 1819, the various treaties of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] had forced the Barbary states to give up piracy almost entirely, and Tripolitania's economy began to crumble. As Yusuf weakened, factions sprung up around his three sons. Civil war soon resulted.<ref name="be205">[[#Bertarelli|Bertarelli]], p. 205.</ref>

Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] sent in troops ostensibly to restore order, marking the end of both the Karamanli dynasty and an independent Tripolitania.<ref name="be205"/> Order was not recovered easily, and the revolt of the Libyan under Abd-El-Gelil and Gûma ben Khalifa lasted until the death of the latter in 1858.<ref name="be205" /> The second period of direct Ottoman rule saw administrative changes, and greater order in the governance of the three provinces of Libya. Ottoman rule finally reasserted to Fezzan between 1850 and 1875 for earning income from Saharan commerce.

===Italian Libya (1911–1947)===

After the [[Italo-Turkish War]] (1911–1912), [[Italy]] simultaneously turned the three regions into colonies.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/1398437.stm |title=Timeline: Libya |publisher=BBC News |date=29 January 2013 |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023080030/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/country_profiles/1398437.stm |archivedate=23 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> From 1912 to 1927, the territory of Libya was known as [[Italian North Africa]]. From 1927 to 1934, the territory was split into two colonies, [[Italian Cyrenaica]] and [[Italian Tripolitania]], run by Italian governors. Some 150,000 Italians settled in Libya, constituting roughly 20% of the total population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-46562/Libya |title=Libya |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Grrb1AAQ?url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339574/Libya |archivedate=25 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 1934, Italy adopted the name "Libya" (used by the Ancient Greeks & Romans for all of [[North Africa]], except Egypt) as the official name of the colony (made up of the three provinces of [[Cyrenaica]], [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]]). [[Omar Mukhtar]] was the resistance leader against the Italian colonization and became a national hero despite his capture and execution on 16 September 1931. His face is currently printed on the Libyan ten dinar note in memory and recognition of his patriotism.
Idris al-Mahdi as-Senussi (later [[Idris of Libya|King Idris I]]), Emir of Cyrenaica, led the Libyan resistance to Italian occupation between the two world wars. [[Ilan Pappé]] estimates that between 1928 and 1932 the Italian military "killed half the Bedouin population (directly or through disease and starvation in camps)."<ref>[[Ilan Pappé]], ''The Modern Middle East.''

In 1934 was created by governor [[Italo Balbo|Balbo]] the political entity called "Libya", with capital Tripoli<ref>[https://bjuniornewblog.blogspot.com/2019/03/italian-tripoli.html Italian Tripoli]</ref>. The Italians emphasized infrastructure improvements and public works. In particular, they hugely expanded Libyan railway and road networks from 1934 to 1940, building hundreds of kilometers of new roads and railways and encouraging the establishment of new industries and dozen of new agricultural villages.

In June 1940, [[Military history of Italy during World War II|Italy entered World War II]]. Libya became the setting for the hard-fought [[North African Campaign]] that ultimately ended in defeat for Italy and its [[Afrika Korps|German ally]] in 1943.

From 1943 to 1951, Libya was under [[Allied occupation of Libya|Allied occupation]]. The British military [[British Military Administration (Libya)|administered]] the two former Italian Libyan provinces of Tripolitana and Cyrenaïca, while the French [[French Fezzan|administered]] the province of Fezzan. In 1944, Idris returned from exile in [[Cairo]] but declined to resume permanent residence in Cyrenaica until the removal of some aspects of foreign control in 1947.

On 24 December 1951, Libya declared its independence as the [[Kingdom of Libya|United Kingdom of Libya]], a constitutional and hereditary [[monarchy]] under King [[Idris of Libya|Idris]], Libya's only monarch. The discovery of significant [[oil reserves]] in 1959 and the subsequent income from [[petroleum]] sales enabled one of the world's poorest nations to establish an extremely wealthy state. Although oil drastically improved the Libyan government's finances, resentment among some factions began to build over the increased concentration of the nation's wealth in the hands of King Idris.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ-VAkIdiX0C&pg=PA161|title=Internet View of the Arabic World|last=Schiller|first=Jon|date=2009-11-29|publisher=CreateSpace|isbn=9781439263266|location=|pages=161|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320153024/https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ-VAkIdiX0C&pg=PA161|archivedate=20 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Gaddafi also wanted to combat the strict social restrictions that had been imposed on women by the previous regime, establishing the Revolutionary Women's Formation to encourage reform. In 1970, a law was introduced affirming equality of the sexes and insisting on wage parity. In 1971, Gaddafi sponsored the creation of a Libyan General Women's Federation. In 1972, a law was passed criminalizing the marriage of any females under the age of sixteen and ensuring that a woman's consent was a necessary prerequisite for a marriage.<ref>Bearman, Jonathan (1986).

In January 2015, meetings were held with the aim to find a peaceful agreement between the rival parties in Libya. The so-called Geneva-Ghadames talks were supposed to bring the GNC and the Tobruk government together at one table to find a solution of the internal conflict. However, the GNC actually never participated, a sign that internal division not only affected the "Tobruk Camp", but also the "Tripoli Camp". Meanwhile, terrorism within Libya has steadily increased, affecting also neighbouring countries. The [[Bardo National Museum attack|terrorist attack against the Bardo Museum]] on 18 March 2015, was reportedly carried on by two Libyan-trained militants.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fanack|title=Terrorism Increases in Libya as Politicians Talk|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/libya/history-past-to-present/terrorism-increases-in-libya/|website=Fanack.com|accessdate=13 May 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518082502/https://chronicle.fanack.com/libya/history-past-to-present/terrorism-increases-in-libya/|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In July 2015 SRSG Leon reported to the UN Security Council  on the progress of the negotiations, which at that point had just achieved a political agreement on 11 July setting out "a comprehensive framework…includ[ing] guiding principles…institutions and decision-making mechanisms to guide the transition until the adoption of a permanent constitution."  The stated purpose of that process was "…intended to culminate in the creation of a modern, democratic state based on the principle of inclusion, the rule of law, separation of powers and respect for human rights." The SRSG praised the participants for achieving agreement, stating that "The Libyan people have unequivocally expressed themselves in favour of peace."  The SRSG then informed the Security Council that "Libya is at a critical stage" and urging "all parties in Libya to continue to engage constructively in the dialogue process", stating that "only through dialogue and political compromise, can a peaceful resolution of the conflict be achieved. A peaceful transition will only succeed in Libya through a significant and coordinated effort in supporting a future Government of National Accord…".
Talks, negotiations and dialogue continued on during mid-2015 at various international locations, culminating at Skhirat in Morocco in early September.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/undpa/speeches-statements/15072015/libya |title=15 July 2015, Security Council briefing on the situation in Libya, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Libya Bernardino Leon &#124; Department of Political Affairs |website=Un.org |date=15 July 2015 |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023061451/http://www.un.org/undpa/speeches-statements/15072015/libya |archivedate=23 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Miles |first=Tom |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/05/us-libya-security-talks-idUSKCN0R428N20150905 |title=U.N. sees Libya talks entering final mile, eyes Sept. 20 deal |publisher=Reuters |date=4 September 2015 |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023060912/http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/09/05/us-libya-security-talks-idUSKCN0R428N20150905 |archivedate=23 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

There are a few scattered uninhabited small oases, usually linked to the major depressions, where water can be found by digging to a few feet in depth. In the west there is a widely dispersed group of oases in unconnected shallow depressions, the Kufra group, consisting of Tazerbo, Rebianae and [[Kufra]].<ref name="Libdesert" /> Aside from the scarps, the general flatness is only interrupted by a series of [[plateau]]s and massifs near the centre of the Libyan Desert, around the convergence of the Egyptian-Sudanese-Libyan borders.

Slightly further to the south are the [[massif]]s of Arkenu, Uweinat, and Kissu. These [[granite]] mountains are ancient, having formed long before the sandstones surrounding them. Arkenu and Western Uweinat are ring complexes very similar to those in the [[Aïr Mountains]]. Eastern Uweinat (the highest point in the Libyan Desert) is a raised sandstone plateau adjacent to the granite part further west.<ref name="Libdesert" />

The plain to the north of Uweinat is dotted with eroded volcanic features. With the discovery of oil in the 1950s also came the discovery of a massive [[aquifer]] underneath much of Libya. The water in this aquifer pre-dates the last ice ages and the Sahara Desert itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_562.html |title=Fossil Water in Libya |publisher=NASA |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218110002/http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_562.html |archivedate=18 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This area also contains the [[Arkenu structures]], which were once thought to be two impact craters.<ref name="CigoliniOthers2012a">Cigolini, C, C Laiolo, and M Rossetti (2012) ''Endogenous and nonimpact origin of the Arkenu circular structures (al-Kufrah basin-SE Libya)'' Meteoritics & Planetary Science. 47(11):1772–1788.</ref>

Historically, the area of Libya was considered three provinces (or states), [[Tripolitania]] in the northwest, [[Cyrenaica|Barka (Cyrenaica)]] in the east, and [[Fezzan]] in the southwest. It was the conquest by Italy in the [[Italo-Turkish War]] that united them in a single political unit.

Since 2007, Libya has been divided into 22 districts ([[baladiyat]]):

===Local demographics and ethnic groups===
The original inhabitants of Libya belonged predominantly to various [[Berber people|Berber]] ethnic groups; however, the long series of foreign invasions&nbsp;– particularly by [[Arab people|Arabs]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]]&nbsp;– have had a profound and lasting linguistic, cultural, and identity influence on Libya's demographics.

Today, the great majority of Libya's inhabitants are Arabic-speaking Muslims of mixed descent, with many also tracing their ancestry to the Banu Sulaym tribe, beside Turkish and purely Berber ethnicities. The [[Turks in Libya|Turkish minority]] are often called "[[Kouloughlis]]" and are concentrated in and around villages and towns.<ref>{{Cite book |year=2012 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339574/Libya/46542/Climate#toc46545 |title=Libya |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122084039/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/339574/Libya/46542/Climate#toc46545 |archivedate=22 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Additionally, there are some Libyan ethnic minorities, such as the purely Berber [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and the [[Toubou people|Tebou]].<ref name="Dupree 1958 loc=33-44">{{Cite journal |last=Dupree|first=Louis|year=1958|title=The Non-Arab Ethnic Groups of Libya|journal=Middle East Journal|volume=12|issue=1|pages=33–44 }}</ref>

{{As of|2013}}, the UN estimates that around 12% of Libya's population (upwards of 740,000 people) was made up of foreign migrants.<ref name="auto"/> Prior to the 2011 revolution official and unofficial figures of migrant labour range from 25% to 40% of the population (between 1.5 and 2.4 million people).

It is difficult to estimate the total number of immigrants in Libya as there are often differences between census figures, official counts and usually more accurate unofficial estimates. In the 2006 census, around 359,540 foreign nationals were resident in Libya out of a population of over 5.5 million (6.35% of the population).

If consular records prior to the revolution are used to estimate the immigrant population, as many as 2 million Egyptian migrants were recorded by the Egyptian embassy in Tripoli in 2009, followed by 87,200 Tunisians, and 68,200 Moroccans by their respective embassies. The number of Asian migrants before the revolution were roughly 100,000 (60,000 Bangladeshis, 18,000 Indians, 10,000 Pakistanis, 8000 Filipinos as well as Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese, Thai and other workers).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3685 |title=Libya, Tunisia: Migrants – Migration News &#124; Migration Dialogue |website=Migration.ucdavis.edu |date= |accessdate=1 April 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305132553/https://migration.ucdavis.edu/mn/more.php?id=3685 |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This would put the immigrant population at almost 40% before the revolution and is a figure more consistent with government estimates in 2004 which put the regular and irregular migrant numbers at 1.35 to 1.8 million (25–33% of the population at the time).<ref name="EU migrant policy Centre"/>

Before the 1930s, the [[Senussi]] Sunni Sufi movement was the primary Islamic movement in Libya. This was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its ''zawaaya'' (lodges) were found in [[Tripolitania]] and [[Fezzan]], but Senussi influence was strongest in [[Cyrenaica]].

Many Libyans frequent the country's beach and they also visit Libya's archaeological sites—especially [[Leptis Magna]], which is widely considered to be one of the best preserved Roman archaeological sites in the world.<ref>{{cite news |last=Donkin |first=Mike |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4708179.stm |title=Libya's tourist treasures |publisher=BBC News |date=23 July 2005 |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410014022/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4708179.stm |archivedate=10 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most common form of public transport between cities is the bus, though many people travel by automobile.<ref name="libyafacts2">{{cite web |url=http://looklex.com/libya/z_gettingthere.htm |title=Libya – Getting there |publisher=Looklex.com |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205072604/http://looklex.com/libya/z_gettingthere.htm |archivedate=5 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There are no railway services in Libya, but these are planned for construction in the near future (see [[rail transport in Libya]]).<ref name="libyafacts2" />

Libya's capital, [[Tripoli]], has many museums and archives. These include the Government Library, the Ethnographic Museum, the Archaeological Museum, the National Archives, the Epigraphy Museum and the Islamic Museum. The [[Red Castle Museum]] located in the capital near the coast and right in the city center, built in consultation with [[UNESCO]], may be the country's most famous.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000857/085703eo.pdf#85688 |title=Museum Architecture: beyond the <> and ... beyond |author=Bouchenaki, Mounir |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230451/http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0008/000857/085703eo.pdf#85688 |archivedate=2 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{main|Libyan cuisine}}
Libyan cuisine is a mixture of the different [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], Bedouin and traditional Arab culinary influences.<ref name="libyafacts3">{{cite web |url=http://looklex.com/libya/z_eatandsleep.htm |title=Libya – Eat and Sleep |publisher=Looklex.com |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205072554/http://looklex.com/libya/z_eatandsleep.htm |archivedate=5 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Pasta]] is the staple food in the Western side of Libya, whereas [[rice]] is generally the staple food in the east.

Common Libyan foods include several variations of red (tomato) sauce based pasta dishes (similar to the Italian [[Arrabbiata sauce|Sugo all'arrabbiata]] dish); rice, usually served with lamb or chicken (typically stewed, fried, grilled, or boiled in-sauce); and [[couscous]], which is steam cooked whilst held over boiling red (tomato) sauce and meat (sometimes also containing courgettes/zucchini and chickpeas), which is typically served along with cucumber slices, lettuce and olives.

[[Bazeen]], a dish made from barley flour and served with red tomato sauce, is customarily eaten communally, with several people sharing the same dish, usually by hand. This dish is commonly served at traditional weddings or festivities. [[Asida]] is a sweet version of Bazeen, made from white flour and served with a mix of honey, ghee or butter. Another favorite way to serve Asida is with [[Rub (syrup)|rub]] (fresh date syrup) and olive oil. [[Usban]] is animal tripe stitched and stuffed with rice and vegetables cooked in tomato based soup or steamed. [[Chorba|Shurba]] is a red tomato sauce-based soup, usually served with small grains of pasta.<ref name="libyafacts3" />

A very common snack eaten by Libyans is known as ''khubs bi' tun'', literally meaning "bread with tuna fish", usually served as a baked baguette or pita bread stuffed with tuna fish that has been mixed with [[harissa]] (chili sauce) and olive oil. Many snack vendors prepare these sandwiches and they can be found all over Libya. Libyan restaurants may serve international cuisine, or may serve simpler fare such as lamb, chicken, vegetable stew, potatoes and [[macaroni]].<ref name="libyafacts3" /> Due to severe lack of infrastructure, many under-developed areas and small towns do not have restaurants and instead food stores may be the only source to obtain food products.<ref name="libyafacts3" /> Alcohol consumption is illegal in the entire country.<ref name="libyafacts">{{cite web |url=http://looklex.com/libya/z_facts.htm |title=Libya Facts |publisher=Looklex.com |accessdate=5 February 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715150859/http://looklex.com/libya/z_facts.htm |archivedate=15 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Dates are harvested, dried and can be eaten as they are, made into syrup or slightly fried and eaten with [[bsisa]] and milk. After eating, Libyans often drink black tea. This is normally repeated a second time (for the second glass of tea), and in the third round of tea, it is served with roasted [[peanut]]s or roasted [[almond]]s known as ''shay bi'l-luz'' (mixed with the tea in the same glass).<ref name="Libyan Food" />

Since 1975 the number of universities has grown from two to nine and after their introduction in 1980, the number of higher technical and vocational institutes currently stands at 84 (with 12 public universities).{{Clarify|pre-text=?|date=October 2012}}<ref name="Libedu" /> Since 2007 some new private universities such as the [[Libyan International Medical University]] have been established.

'''Jordan''' ({{lang-ar|الْأُرْدُنّ}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Al-ʾUrdunn}}'' {{IPA-ar|al.ʔur.dunː|}}), officially the '''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan''' ({{lang-ar|المملكة الأردنية الهاشمية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Al-Mamlakah Al-Urdunnīyah Al-Hāshimīyah}}''), is an [[Arab country]] in [[Western Asia]], on the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank]] of the [[Jordan River]]. Jordan is bordered by [[Saudi Arabia]] to the south, [[Iraq]] to the north-east, [[Syria]] to the north and [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] ([[West Bank]]) to the west. The [[Dead Sea]] is located along its western borders and the country has a small coastline to the [[Red Sea]] in its extreme south-west, but is otherwise landlocked.<ref name="Jogeo">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DJgnebGbAB8C&pg=PA498|page=498|title=Encyclopedia of World Geography|first=R.

What is now Jordan has been inhabited by humans since the [[Paleolithic]] period. Three stable kingdoms emerged there at the end of the [[Bronze Age]]: [[Ammon]], [[Moab]] and [[Edom]]. Later rulers include the [[Nabataean Kingdom]], the [[Roman Empire]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] against the Ottomans in 1916 during [[World War I]], the [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire was partitioned]] by Britain and France. The [[Emirate of Transjordan]] was established in 1921 by the [[Hashemite]], then [[Emir]], [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Abdullah I]], and the emirate became a British [[protectorate]]. In 1946, Jordan became an independent state officially known as the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan'', but was renamed in 1949 to the ''Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan'' after the country [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|captured]] the [[West Bank]] during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] and annexed it until it was lost to Israel in [[Six-Day War|1967]]. Jordan renounced its claim to the territory in [[Jordanian disengagement from the West Bank|1988]], and became one of two Arab states to sign a [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty|peace treaty]] with [[Israel]] in 1994.<ref name="HKJ"/> Jordan is a founding member of the [[Arab League]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Co-operation]]. The [[sovereign state]] is a [[constitutional monarchy]], but the king holds wide [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Legislature|legislative]] powers.

Jordan is a relatively small, semi-arid, almost landlocked country with an area of {{Convert|89,342|km2|abbr=on}} and a population numbering 10 million, making it the [[List of Arab countries by population|11th-most populous Arab country]]. [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islam]], practiced by around 95% of the population, is the dominant religion in Jordan and coexists with an indigenous [[Christianity in Jordan|Christian minority]]. Jordan has been repeatedly referred to as an "oasis of stability" in a turbulent region. It has been mostly unscathed by the violence that swept the region following the [[Arab Spring]] in 2010.<ref name="TDBC">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/05/jordan-the-last-arab-safe-haven.html|title=Jordan: The Last Arab Safe Haven|publisher=The Daily Beast|date=5 October 2013|accessdate=12 October 2015|first=Christopher|last=Dickey}}</ref> From as early as 1948, Jordan has accepted refugees from multiple neighbouring countries in conflict. An estimated 2.1 million [[Palestinian refugees|Palestinian]] and 1.4 million [[Syrian refugees|Syrian]] refugees are present in Jordan as of a 2015 census.<ref name="census"/> The kingdom is also a refuge to thousands of [[Iraqi Christians]] fleeing persecution by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]].<ref name="thenational.ae">{{cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/world/middle-east/jordan-the-safe-haven-for-christians-fleeing-isil#full|title=Jordan: The safe haven for Christians fleeing ISIL|publisher=The National|date=14 February 2015|first=Justin|last=Vela|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> While Jordan continues to accept refugees, the recent large influx from Syria placed substantial strain on national resources and infrastructure.<ref name="UNHCR">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e486566.html|accessdate=12 October 2015|title=2015 UNHCR country operations profile – Jordan|publisher=UNHCR|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20141002061205/http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49e486566.html|archivedate=2 October 2014}}</ref>

Jordan is classified as a country of "high human development" with an "upper middle income" economy. The [[Economy of Jordan|Jordanian economy]], one of the smallest economies in the region, is attractive to foreign investors based upon a skilled workforce.<ref name="skwf"/> The country is a major tourist destination, also attracting [[medical tourism]] due to its well developed [[Health in Jordan|health sector]].<ref name="tourists">{{cite news|url=http://www.petra.gov.jo/Public_News/Nws_NewsDetails.aspx?Site_Id=1&lang=2&NewsID=242529&CatID=13&Type=Home&GType=1|title=Jordan second top Arab destination to German tourists|publisher=Petra|agency=Jordan News|date=11 March 2016|accessdate=12 March 2016}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Nonetheless, a lack of natural resources, large flow of refugees and regional turmoil have hampered economic growth.<ref name="washington"/>

The kingdom has followed a pro-Western [[foreign policy]] and maintained close relations with the United States and the United Kingdom. During the first [[Gulf War]] (1990), these relations were damaged by Jordan's neutrality and its maintenance of relations with Iraq. Later, Jordan restored its relations with Western countries through its participation in the enforcement of UN sanctions against Iraq and in the Southwest Asia peace process. After King Hussein's death in 1999, relations between Jordan and the Persian Gulf countries greatly improved.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rubincenter.org/2002/06/swaidan-and-nica-2002-06-07/|title=The 1991 Gulf War and Jordan’s Economy|accessdate=20 March 2016|date=7 June 2002|publisher=Rubin Center Research in International Affairs|first1=Ziad|last1=Swaidan|first2=Mihai|last2=Nica}}</ref>

Jordan is ranked as having the 35th best infrastructure in the world, one of the highest rankings in the developing world, according to the 2010 World Economic Forum's Index of Economic Competitiveness.

Jordan's military industry thrived after the [[King Abdullah Design and Development Bureau]] (KADDB) defence company was established by King Abdullah II in 1999, to provide an indigenous capability for the supply of scientific and technical services to the [[Jordanian Armed Forces]], and to become a global hub in security research and development. It manufactures all types of military products, many of which are presented at the bi-annually held international military exhibition [[Special Operations Forces Exhibition|SOFEX]]. In 2015, KADDB exported $72 million worth of industries to over 42 countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/kaddb-become-main-provider-army%E2%80%99s-weapons-defence-equipment%E2%80%99|accessdate=16 June 2016|date=28 April 2015|title=KADDB to become main provider of army’s weapons, defence equipment|publisher=The Jordan Times}}</ref>

The most distinctive Jordanian dish is [[mansaf]], the national dish of Jordan. The dish is a symbol for Jordanian hospitality and is influenced by the Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with pine nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used.<ref name="Mansaf"/> Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as [[baklava]], hareeseh, [[knafeh]], [[halva]] and [[qatayef]], a dish made specially for [[Ramadan]]. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea flavoured with [[Mentha|na'na]] or [[Salvia officinalis|meramiyyeh]] is almost a ritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alghad.com/articles/879262-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%81%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%B1|title=الحلويات في رمضان.. متعة ما بعد الإفطار|language=Arabic|publisher=Al-Ghad|date=30 June 2015|accessdate=16 June 2016|trans-title=Sweets in Ramadan .. what fun after breakfast}}</ref>

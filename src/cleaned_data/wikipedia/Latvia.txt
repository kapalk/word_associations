==Etymology==
The name ''Latvija'' is derived from the name of the ancient [[Latgalians]], one of four [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[Balts|Baltic tribes]] (along with [[Couronians]], [[Selonians]] and [[Semigallians]]), which formed the ethnic core of modern [[Latvian people|Latvians]] together with the [[Baltic Finns|Finnic]] [[Livonian people|Livonians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latinst.lv/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Latvia_in_brief.pdf |title=Latvia in Brief |year=2012 |publisher=Latvian Institute |accessdate=12 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108155832/http://latinst.lv/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Latvia_in_brief.pdf |archivedate=8 November 2012 |df= }}</ref> [[Henry of Latvia]] coined the [[latinisation of names|latinisations]] of the country's name, "Lettigallia" and "Lethia", both derived from the Latgalians.

In the 12th century in the territory of Latvia, there were 14 lands with their rulers: [[Vanema]], [[Ventava]], [[Bandava]], [[Piemare]], [[Duvzare]], [[Ceklis]], [[Megava]], [[Pilsāts]], [[Upmale]], [[Sēlija]], [[Principality of Koknese|Koknese]], [[Jersika]], [[Tālava]] and [[Adzele]].<ref>Latvijas vēstures atlants, Jānis Turlajs, page 12, Karšu izdevniecība Jāņa sēta, {{ISBN|978-9984-07-614-0}}</ref>

Several important cultural changes occurred during this time. Under Swedish and largely German rule, western Latvia adopted [[Lutheranism]] as its main religion. The ancient tribes of the Couronians, Semigallians, Selonians, Livs, and northern Latgallians assimilated to form the [[Latvian people]], speaking one [[Latvian language]]. Throughout all the centuries, however, an actual Latvian state had not been established, so the borders and definitions of who exactly fell within that group are largely subjective. Meanwhile, largely isolated from the rest of Latvia, southern Latgallians adopted [[Catholicism]] under Polish/[[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] influence. The native dialect remained distinct, although it acquired many Polish and Russian loanwords.<ref>{{cite journal|author= V.

=== Latvia in the Russian Empire (1795–1917) ===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2015}}
The [[capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710 and the [[Treaty of Nystad]], ending the [[Great Northern War]] in 1721, gave Vidzeme to Russia (it became part of the [[Governorate of Livonia|Riga Governorate]]).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Latgale region remained part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as [[Inflanty Voivodeship]] until 1772, when it was incorporated into Russia. The [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] became an [[autonomous area|autonomous]] Russian province (the [[Courland Governorate]]) in 1795, bringing all of what is now Latvia into the [[Russian Empire]]. All three Baltic provinces preserved local laws, German as the local [[official language]] and their own parliament, the [[Landtag]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

During the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721), up to 40 percent of Latvians died from famine and plague.<ref>{{cite book|author=Kevin O'Connor|title=The History of the Baltic States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&pg=PA29|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-32355-3|pages=29–}}</ref> Half the residents of Riga were killed by [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|plague in 1710–1711]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bank.lv/eng/main/am/jubmon/nmp/index.php?32661 |title=Collector Coin Dedicated to 18th Century Riga |accessdate=19 July 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719083420/http://www.bank.lv/eng/main/am/jubmon/nmp/index.php?32661 |archivedate=19 July 2010 |df=dmy }}.

The emancipation of the serfs took place in Courland in 1817 and in Vidzeme in 1819.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In practice, however, the emancipation was actually advantageous to the landowners and nobility,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} as it dispossessed peasants of their land without compensation, forcing them to return to work at the estates "of their own free will".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

During the 19th century, the social structure changed dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} A class of independent farmers established itself after reforms allowed the peasants to repurchase their land, but many landless peasants remained.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} There also developed a growing urban [[proletariat]] and an increasingly influential Latvian [[bourgeoisie]]. The [[Young Latvians|Young Latvian]] ({{lang-lv|Jaunlatvieši}}) movement laid the groundwork for nationalism from the middle of the century, many of its leaders looking to the [[Slavophile]]s for support against the prevailing German-dominated social order.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The rise in use of the Latvian language in literature and society became known as the [[Latvian National Awakening|First National Awakening]]. [[Russification]] began in Latgale after the Polish led the [[January Uprising]] in 1863: this spread to the rest of what is now Latvia by the 1880s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Young Latvians were largely eclipsed by the [[New Current]], a broad leftist social and political movement, in the 1890s. Popular discontent exploded in the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], which took a nationalist character in the Baltic provinces.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

During these two centuries Latvia experienced economic and construction boom – ports were expanded (Riga became the largest port in the Russian Empire), railways built; new factories, banks, and a University were established; many residential, public (theatres and museums), and school buildings were erected; new parks formed; and so on. Riga's boulevards and some streets outside the Old Town date from this period.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Worth mentioning is the fact that [[numeracy]] was also higher in the Estonian and Latvian parts of the Russian Empire, which may have been influenced by the Protestant religion of the inhabitants.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, Jörg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

===Declaration of independence===

[[File:Karlis Ulmanis.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kārlis Ulmanis]]]]
[[World War I]] devastated the territory of what became the state of Latvia, and other western parts of the Russian Empire. Demands for [[self-determination]] were initially confined to [[autonomy]], until a power vacuum was created by the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, followed by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] between Russia and Germany in March 1918, then the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] armistice with Germany on 11 November 1918. On 18 November 1918, in Riga, the [[Tautas padome|People's Council of Latvia]] proclaimed the independence of the new country, with [[Kārlis Ulmanis]] becoming the head of the [[Latvian Provisional Government|provisional government]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
The General representative of Germany [[August Winnig]] formally handed over political power to the Latvian Provisional Government on 26 November.

The [[Latvian War of Independence|war of independence]] that followed was part of a general chaotic period of civil and new border wars in Eastern Europe. By the spring of 1919, there were actually three governments: the Provisional government headed by [[Kārlis Ulmanis]], supported by [[Tautas padome]] and the [[Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control|Inter-Allied Commission of Control]]; the [[Latvian Socialist Soviet Republic|Latvian Soviet government]] led by [[Pēteris Stučka]], supported by the [[Red Army]]; and the Provisional government headed by [[Andrievs Niedra]] and supported by the [[Baltische Landeswehr]] and the German [[Freikorps]] unit ''[[Freikorps in the Baltic|Iron Division]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Estonian and Latvian forces defeated the Germans at the [[Battle of Cēsis (1919)|Battle of Wenden]] in June 1919,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/cesis_battle_of|title=Cēsis, Battle of {{!}} International Encyclopedia of the First World War (WW1)|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> and a massive attack by a predominantly German force—the [[West Russian Volunteer Army]]—under [[Pavel Bermondt-Avalov]] was repelled in November. Eastern Latvia was cleared of Red Army forces by Latvian and Polish troops in early 1920 (from the Polish perspective the [[Battle of Daugavpils]] was a part of the [[Polish–Soviet War]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

A freely elected [[Constituent assembly]] convened on 1 May 1920, and adopted a liberal constitution, the ''[[Constitution of Latvia|Satversme]]'', in February 1922.<ref>Bleiere, p. 155</ref> The constitution was partly suspended by Kārlis Ulmanis after his coup in 1934 but reaffirmed in 1990. Since then, it has been amended and is still in effect in Latvia today. With most of Latvia's industrial base evacuated to the interior of Russia in 1915, radical [[land reform]] was the central political question for the young state. In 1897, 61.2% of the rural population had been landless; by 1936, that percentage had been reduced to 18%.<ref>Bleiere, p. 195</ref>

By 1923, the extent of cultivated land surpassed the pre-war level. Innovation and rising productivity led to rapid growth of the economy, but it soon suffered from the effects of the [[Great Depression]]. Latvia showed signs of economic recovery, and the electorate had steadily moved toward the centre during the parliamentary period.{{citation needed|date=November 2009}} On 15 May 1934, [[1934 Latvian coup d'état|Ulmanis staged a bloodless coup]], establishing a nationalist dictatorship that lasted until 1940.<ref name="Country profile">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1108059.stm|title=Timeline: Latvia|publisher=BBC News|date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=5 February 2010}}</ref> After 1934, Ulmanis established government corporations to buy up private firms with the aim of "Latvianising" the economy.<ref>{{cite book|jstor=2119564|author1=Nicholas Balabkins|author2=Arnolds P.

Early in the morning of 24 August 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. The pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany's defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet "[[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]".<ref name="mrtext">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1939pact.html ''Text of the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact''], executed 23 August 1939</ref> In the north, Latvia, [[Finland]] and Estonia were assigned to the Soviet sphere.<ref name="mrtext"/> A week later, on 1 September 1939, Germany and on 17 September, the Soviet Union [[Soviet invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]].<ref name="PBBG">{{cite book |first=Prit |last=Buttar |title=Between Giants |ISBN=9781780961637}}</ref>{{rp|32}}

On 22 June 1941 German troops attacked Soviet forces in Operation Barbarossa. There were some spontaneous uprisings by Latvians against the Red Army which helped the Germans.

In 1944, when Soviet military advances reached Latvia, heavy fighting took place in Latvia between German and Soviet troops, which ended in another German defeat. In the course of the war, both occupying forces conscripted Latvians into their armies, in this way increasing the loss of the nation's "live resources". In 1944, part of the Latvian territory once more came under Soviet control. The Soviets immediately began to reinstate the Soviet system. After the German surrender, it became clear that Soviet forces were there to stay, and [[Latvian national partisans]], soon joined by some who had collaborated with the Germans, began to fight against the new occupier.<ref>Lumans, pp. 395–396</ref>

On 25 March 1949, 43,000 rural residents ("[[kulak]]s") and Latvian patriots ("nationalists") were deported to Siberia in a sweeping [[Operation Priboi]] in all three [[Baltic states]], which was carefully planned and approved in Moscow already on 29 January 1949.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Strods, Heinrihs |author2=Kott, Matthew |year=2002|title=The File on Operation 'Priboi': A Re-Assessment of the Mass Deportations of 1949|journal=Journal of Baltic Studies |volume=33|issue=1|pages= 1–36|doi= 10.1080/01629770100000191}}</ref> This operation had the desired effect of reducing the anti Soviet partisan activity.<ref name=PBBG/>{{rp|326}} Between 136,000 and 190,000 Latvians, depending on the sources, were imprisoned or deported to Soviet concentration camps (the [[Gulag]]) in the post war years, from 1945 to 1952.<ref>Lumans, pp. 398–399</ref> Some managed to escape arrest and joined the partisans.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}
[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Reconstruction of a [[Gulag]] shack in the [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]], Riga]]
In the post-war period, Latvia was made to adopt Soviet farming methods. Rural areas were forced into [[collectivisation]].<ref>Bleiere, p. 384</ref> An extensive programme to impose [[bilingualism]] was initiated in Latvia, limiting the use of Latvian language in official uses in favour of using Russian as the main language. All of the minority schools (Jewish, Polish, Belarusian, Estonian, Lithuanian) were closed down leaving only two media of instructions in the schools: Latvian and Russian.<ref>Bleiere, p. 411</ref> An influx of labourers, administrators, military personnel and their dependants from Russia and other Soviet republics started. By 1959 about 400,000 people arrived from other Soviet republics and the ethnic Latvian population had fallen to 62%.<ref>Bleiere, p. 418</ref>

Since Latvia had maintained a well-developed infrastructure and educated specialists, Moscow decided to base some of the Soviet Union's most advanced manufacturing in Latvia. New industry was created in Latvia, including a major [[Riga Autobus Factory|machinery factory RAF]] in [[Jelgava]], electrotechnical factories in [[Riga]], chemical factories in [[Daugavpils]], [[Valmiera]] and [[Olaine]]—and some food and oil processing plants.<ref>Bleiere, p. 379</ref> Latvia manufactured trains, ships, minibuses, mopeds, telephones, radios and hi-fi systems, electrical and diesel engines, textiles, furniture, clothing, bags and luggage, shoes, musical instruments, home appliances, watches, tools and equipment, aviation and agricultural equipment and long list of other goods. Latvia had its own film industry and musical records factory (LPs). However, there were not enough people to operate the newly built factories.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} To maintain and expand industrial production, skilled workers were migrating from all over the Soviet Union, decreasing the proportion of ethnic Latvians in the republic.<ref>Lumans, p. 400</ref> The population of Latvia reached its peak in 1990 at just under 2.7 million people.

In late 2018 the National Archives of Latvia released a full alphabetical index of some 10,000 people recruited as agents or informants by the Soviet KGB.

===Restoration of independence in 1991===
{{Further|Singing Revolution|Baltic Way|On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia}}
In the second half of the 1980s, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] started to introduce political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union that were called [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. In the summer of 1987, the first large demonstrations were held in Riga at the [[Freedom Monument]]—a symbol of independence. In the summer of 1988, a national movement, coalescing in the [[Popular Front of Latvia]], was opposed by the [[International Front of the Working People of Latvia|Interfront]]. The Latvian SSR, along with the other [[Baltic states|Baltic Republics]] was allowed greater autonomy, and in 1988, the old pre-war [[Flag of Latvia]] flew again, replacing the Soviet Latvian flag as the official flag in 1990.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In 1989, the [[Supreme Soviet of the USSR]] adopted a resolution on the ''[[Occupation of the Baltic states]]'', in which it declared the occupation "not in accordance with law", and not the "will of the Soviet people". Pro-independence Popular Front of Latvia candidates gained a two-thirds majority in the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia|Supreme Council]] in the [[Latvian Supreme Soviet election, 1990|March 1990 democratic elections]]. On 4 May 1990, the Supreme Council adopted the [[Declaration on the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia]], and the Latvian SSR was renamed Republic of Latvia.<ref name="Imagining">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=36JG1JBlNroC&dq=latvia+political+history&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Imagining the Nation: History, Modernity, and Revolution in Latvia|last=Eglitis|first=Daina Stukuls|date=2010-11-01|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=0271045620|language=en}}</ref>

However, the central power in Moscow continued to regard Latvia as a Soviet republic in 1990 and 1991. In January 1991, Soviet political and military forces tried unsuccessfully to overthrow the Republic of Latvia authorities by occupying the central publishing house in Riga and establishing a Committee of National Salvation to usurp governmental functions. During the transitional period, Moscow maintained many central Soviet state authorities in Latvia.<ref name="Imagining" />

In spite of this, 73% of all Latvian residents confirmed their strong support for independence on 3 March 1991, in a nonbinding advisory referendum.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Popular Front of Latvia advocated that all permanent residents be eligible for Latvian citizenship, and that helped sway a large number of ethnic Russians to vote for independence. However, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted. Instead, citizenship was granted to persons who had been citizens of Latvia at the day of loss of independence at 1940 as well as their descendants. As a consequence, the majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship since neither they nor their parents had ever been citizens of Latvia, becoming [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] or citizens of other former Soviet republics. By 2011, more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalisation exams and received Latvian citizenship. Still, today there are 290,660 non-citizens in Latvia, which represent 14.1% of the population. They have [[Statelessness|no citizenship of any country]], and cannot vote in Latvia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/ibelong/stories-of-statelessness-latvia-and-estonia/|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151127055909/http%3A//www.unhcr.org/ibelong/stories%2Dof%2Dstatelessness%2Dlatvia%2Dand%2Destonia/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=27 November 2015|title=Stories of Statelessness: Latvia and Estonia – IBELONG|date=12 January 2015|publisher=}}</ref>

[[File:Turaidas skats uz Gauju 2okt04.JPG|thumb|Latvia has the fifth highest proportion of land covered by forests in the European Union.]]
Most of the country is composed of fertile lowland plains and moderate hills. In a typical Latvian landscape, a mosaic of vast forests alternates with fields, farmsteads, and pastures. Arable land is spotted with birch groves and wooded clusters, which afford a habitat for numerous plants and animals. Latvia has hundreds of kilometres of undeveloped seashore—lined by pine forests, dunes, and continuous white sand beaches.<ref name="Latvia in brief"/><ref name="Nature and Environment in Latvia">{{cite web|url=http://www.latvia.lv/library/nature-and-environment |title=Nature and Environment |publisher=Latvian Institute |year=2002 |accessdate=17 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120927055604/http://www.latvia.lv/library/nature-and-environment |archivedate=27 September 2012 }}</ref>

{{See also|List of cities in Latvia|Planning regions of Latvia|Statistical regions of Latvia|Historical regions of Latvia}}
Latvia is a [[unitary state]], currently divided into 110 one-level municipalities ({{lang-lv|novadi}}) and 9 republican cities ({{lang-lv|republikas pilsētas}}) with their own city council and administration: [[Daugavpils]], [[Jēkabpils]], [[Jelgava]], [[Jūrmala]], [[Liepāja]], [[Rēzekne]], [[Riga]], [[Valmiera]], and [[Ventspils]]. There are four [[Cultural regions of Latvia|historical and cultural regions in Latvia]]&nbsp;– [[Courland]], [[Latgale]], [[Vidzeme]], [[Zemgale]], which are recognised in [[Constitution of Latvia]]. [[Selonia]], a part of Zemgale, is sometimes considered culturally distinct region, but it is not part of any formal division. The borders of historical and cultural regions usually are not explicitly defined and in several sources may vary. In formal divisions, Riga region, which includes the capital and parts of other regions that have a strong relationship with the capital, is also often included in regional divisions; e.g., there are five [[planning regions of Latvia]] ({{lang-lv|plānošanas reģioni}}), which were created in 2009 to promote balanced development of all regions. Under this division Riga region includes large parts of what traditionally is considered Vidzeme, Courland, and Zemgale. [[Statistical regions of Latvia]], established in accordance with the EU [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]], duplicate this division, but divides Riga region into two parts with the capital alone being a separate region.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
The largest city in Latvia is Riga, the second largest city is Daugavpils and the third largest city is Liepaja.

[[File:Lv real gdp growth.svg|thumb|Real GDP growth in Latvia 1996–2006]]
The economic crisis of 2009 proved earlier assumptions that the fast-growing economy was heading for implosion of the [[economic bubble]], because it was driven mainly by growth of domestic [[consumption (economics)|consumption]], financed by a serious increase of private [[debt]], as well as a negative foreign [[balance of trade|trade balance]]. The prices of real estate, which were at some points growing by approximately 5% a month, were long perceived to be too high for the economy, which mainly produces low-value goods and [[raw material]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

[[Privatisation]] in Latvia is almost complete. Virtually all of the previously state-owned small and medium companies have been privatised, leaving only a small number of politically sensitive large state companies. The private sector accounted for nearly 68% of the country's GDP in 2000.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Foreign investment in Latvia is still modest compared with the levels in north-central Europe. A law expanding the scope for selling land, including to foreigners, was passed in 1997. Representing 10.2% of Latvia's total foreign direct investment, American companies invested $127 million in 1999. In the same year, the United States of America exported $58.2 million of goods and services to Latvia and imported $87.9 million. Eager to join Western economic institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], and the [[European Union]], Latvia signed a Europe Agreement with the EU in 1995—with a 4-year transition period. Latvia and the United States have signed treaties on investment, trade, and intellectual property protection and avoidance of double taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-trty/latvia.pdf|title=TAX CONVENTION WITH LATVIA|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/other_treaties/text.jsp?file_id=241419|title=Agreement between the United States of America and the Republic of Latvia on Trade Relations and Intellectual Property Rights Protection|publisher=World Intellectual Property Organization|accessdate=May 19, 2018}}</ref>

The Latvian economy entered a phase of fiscal contraction during the second half of 2008 after an extended period of credit-based speculation and unrealistic appreciation in real estate values.

The [[IMF]] concluded the First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions with the Republic of Latvia in July 2012 announcing that Latvia's economy has been recovering strongly since 2010, following the deep downturn in 2008–09. Real GDP growth of 5.5 percent in 2011 was underpinned by export growth and a recovery in domestic demand. The growth momentum has continued into 2012 and 2013 despite deteriorating external conditions, and the economy is expected to expand by 4.1 percent in 2014.

{{Main|Latvian people|Russians in Latvia{{!}}Latvian Russians|Latvian Germans|Latvian Jews|Latgalians (modern)|Livonians|Gauja Estonians}}
Latvia's population has been [[multiethnic society|multiethnic]] for centuries, though the demographics shifted dramatically in the 20th century due to the World Wars, the emigration and removal of [[Baltic Germans]], [[the Holocaust]], and occupation by the [[Soviet Union]]. According to the [[Russian Empire Census]] of 1897, Latvians formed 68.3% of the total population of 1.93 million; Russians accounted for 12%, Jews for 7.4%, Germans for 6.2%, and Poles for 3.4%.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/latvia/9.htm Latvia&nbsp;– Population]. Source: ''U.S. Library of Congress.''</ref>

As of March 2011, [[Latvian people|Latvians]] form about 62.1% of the population, while 26.9% are [[Russians in the Baltic states|Russians]], [[Belarusians]] 3.3%, [[Ukrainians]] 2.2%, [[Poles]] 2.2%, [[Lithuanians]] 1.2%, [[Jews]] 0.3%, [[Romani people]] 0.3%, [[Germans]] 0.1%, [[Estonians]] 0.1% and others 1.3%. 250 people identify as [[Livonians]] ([[Baltic Finns|Baltic Finnic]] people native to Latvia). There were 290,660 [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] living in Latvia or 14.1% of Latvian residents, mainly ethnic Russians who arrived after the occupation of 1940 and their descendants.<ref>[http://www.csb.gov.lv/en/statistikas-temas/population-census-2011-key-indicators-33613.html Population Census 2011&nbsp;– Key Indicators].

In some cities, e.g., [[Daugavpils]] and [[Rēzekne]], ethnic Latvians constitute a minority of the total population.

===Language===
{{further|Language policy in Latvia}}
The sole official language of Latvia is [[Latvian language|Latvian]], which belongs to the [[Baltic languages|Baltic language sub-group]] of the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language family]]. Another notable language of Latvia is the nearly extinct [[Livonian language]] of the [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]], which enjoys protection by law; [[Latgalian language|Latgalian]]&nbsp;– referred to as either a dialect or a distinct separate language of Latvian&nbsp;– is also formally protected by Latvian law but only as a historical variation of the Latvian language. [[Russian language|Russian]], which was widely spoken during the Soviet period, is still the most widely used minority language by far (in 2011, 34% spoke it at home, including people who were not ethnically Russian).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.csb.gov.lv/Table.aspx?layout=tableViewLayout1&px_tableid=tautassk_11%5c2011.gada+tautas+skait%c4%ab%c5%a1anas+gal%c4%abgie+rezult%c4%81ti%5cTSG11-071.px&px_language=en&px_type=PX&px_db=tautassk_11&rxid=c8c8a0dd-6a8e-4e89-add7-718c9998db99 |title=THNICITIES OF RESIDENT POPULATION IN STATISTICAL REGIONS, CITIES UNDER STATE JURISDICTION AND COUNTIES BY LANGUAGE MOSTLY SPOKEN AT HOME; ON 1 MARCH 2011 |publisher=Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia |accessdate=1 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517201119/http://data.csb.gov.lv/Table.aspx?layout=tableViewLayout1&px_tableid=tautassk_11%5c2011.gada+tautas+skait%c4%ab%c5%a1anas+gal%c4%abgie+rezult%c4%81ti%5cTSG11-071.px&px_language=en&px_type=PX&px_db=tautassk_11&rxid=c8c8a0dd-6a8e-4e89-add7-718c9998db99 |archivedate= 17 May 2016 |df= }}</ref>
While it is now required that all school students learn Latvian, most schools also include English, Russian and German in their curricula. English and Russian are also widely accepted in Latvia, especially in business and tourism. {{As of|2014}} there were 109 schools for minorities that use Russian as the language of instruction for 40% of subjects (the remaining 60% of subjects are taught in Latvian).

On 18 February 2012, Latvia held a [[Latvian constitutional referendum, 2012|constitutional referendum]] on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html/|title=Referendum on the Draft Law 'Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia'|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=2 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502013728/http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html|archive-date=2 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/|title=Results of the referendum on the Draft Law 'Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia'|language=Latvian|publisher=Central Election Commission of Latvia|year=2012|accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref>

Beginning in 2019, instruction in [[Russian language in Latvia|Russian language]] will be gradually discontinued in private colleges and [[private university|universities]] in Latvia, as well as general instruction in Latvian public [[high school]]s,<ref>{{cite news |title=Latvia pushes majority language in schools, leaving parents miffed |url=https://www.dw.com/en/latvia-pushes-majority-language-in-schools-leaving-parents-miffed/a-45385830 |agency=Deutsche Welle |date=8 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Moscow threatens sanctions against Latvia over removal of Russian from secondary schools |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/03/moscow-threatens-sanctions-against-latvia-removal-russian-secondary/ |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=3 April 2018}}</ref> except for subjects related to culture and history of the Russian minority, such as Russian language and literature classes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://eng.lsm.lv/article/society/education/government-okays-transition-to-latvian-as-sole-language-at-schools-in-2019.a265290/|title=Government okays transition to Latvian as sole language at schools in 2019|date=January 23, 2018|publisher=[[Public Broadcasting of Latvia]]}}</ref>

The largest religion in Latvia is [[Christianity]] (79%),<ref name=cia/><ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/> The largest groups {{As of|2011|lc=y}} were:
* [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Latvia]]&nbsp;– 708,773<ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija" />
* [[Roman Catholicism in Latvia|Roman Catholic]]&nbsp;– 500,000<ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija">{{cite web|url=http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx |title=Tieslietu ministrijā iesniegtie reliģisko organizāciju pārskati par darbību 2011. gadā |language=Latvian |accessdate=25 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126013327/http://www.tm.gov.lv/lv/labumi/TM.docx |archivedate=26 November 2012 }}</ref>
* [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]]&nbsp;– 370,000<ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija" />

In the [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2010, 38% of Latvian citizens responded that "they believe there is a God", while 48% answered that "they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force" and 11% stated that "they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force".

Lutheranism was more prominent before the Soviet occupation, when it was a majority religion of ~60% due to strong historical links with the [[Nordic countries]] and influence of the [[Hanseatic League|Hansa]], and [[Germany]] in general. Since then, Lutheranism has declined to a slightly greater extent than Roman Catholicism in all three [[Baltic states]]. The Evangelical Lutheran Church, with an estimated 600,000 members in 1956, was affected most adversely. An internal document of 18 March 1987, near the end of communist rule, spoke of an active membership that had shrunk to only 25,000 in Latvia, but the faith has since experienced a revival.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mongabay.com/reference/country_studies/latvia/SOCIETY.html |title=Latvia&nbsp;– SOCIETY |publisher=Mongabay.com |date=18 March 1987 |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The country's Orthodox Christians belong to the [[Latvian Orthodox Church]], a semi-autonomous body within the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. In 2011, there were 416 [[Jews]] and 319 [[Islam in Latvia|Muslims]] living in Latvia.<ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/>

There are more than 600 Latvian [[neopaganism|neopagans]], ''[[Dievturība|Dievturi]]'' (The Godskeepers), whose religion is based on [[Latvian mythology]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bibelesbiedriba.lv/religiju-enciklopedija/statistika.html|title=Statistics of approved parishes in Latvia|date=1 January 2004|accessdate=7 March 2007|work=Reliģiju Enciklopēdija|publisher=The Latvian Bible Society|language=Latvian}}</ref> About 21% of the total population is not affiliated with a specific religion.<ref name="Tieslietu Ministrija"/>

The [[University of Daugavpils]] is another significant centre of education.

Between the 13th and 19th centuries, [[Baltic Germans]], many of whom were originally of non-German ancestry but had been assimilated into [[German language in Europe|German culture]], formed the upper class.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} They developed distinct cultural heritage, characterised by both Latvian and German influences. It has survived in German Baltic families to this day, in spite of their dispersal to Germany, the United States, Canada and other countries in the early 20th century. However, most indigenous Latvians did not participate in this particular cultural life.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Thus, the mostly peasant local [[paganism|pagan]] heritage was preserved, partly merging with Christian traditions. For example, one of the most popular celebrations is [[Jāņi]], a pagan celebration of the [[summer solstice]]—which Latvians celebrate on the feast day of St. [[John the Baptist]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In the 19th century, Latvian nationalist movements emerged. They promoted Latvian culture and encouraged Latvians to take part in cultural activities. The 19th century and beginning of the 20th century is often regarded by Latvians as a classical era of Latvian culture. Posters show the influence of other European cultures, for example, works of artists such as the Baltic-German artist [[Bernhard Borchert]] and the French [[Raoul Dufy]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} With the onset of World War II, many Latvian artists and other members of the cultural elite fled the country yet continued to produce their work, largely for a Latvian émigré audience.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latvianart.org/historical.html |title=Historical Background |work=Global Society for Latvian Art |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029113142/http://latvianart.org/historical.html |archivedate=29 October 2009 }}</ref>

The [[Latvian Song and Dance Festival]] is an important event in [[Latvians|Latvian]] culture and social life. It has been held since 1873, normally every five years. Approximately 30,000 performers altogether participate in the event.<ref>[http://www.dziesmusvetki2003.lv/?sadala=15 23rd All Latvian Song Festival]. Retrieved 7 March 2007</ref> Folk songs and classical choir songs are sung, with emphasis on [[a cappella]] singing, though modern popular songs have recently been incorporated into the repertoire as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

After incorporation into the [[Soviet Union]], Latvian artists and writers were forced to follow the [[socialist realism]] style of art. During the Soviet era, music became increasingly popular, with the most popular being songs from the 1980s. At this time, songs often made fun of the characteristics of Soviet life and were concerned about preserving Latvian identity. This aroused popular protests against the USSR and also gave rise to an increasing popularity of poetry. Since independence, theatre, [[scenography]], [[choir|choir music]], and classical music have become the most notable branches of Latvian culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

During July 2014, [[Riga]] hosted the 8th [[World Choir Games]] as it played host to over 27,000 choristers representing over 450 choirs and over 70 countries. The festival is the biggest of its kind in the world and is held every two years in a different host city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interkultur.com/competitions-festivals/world-choir-games/riga-2014/ |title=World Choir Games Riga 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205110141/http://www.interkultur.com/competitions-festivals/world-choir-games/riga-2014/ |archivedate=5 February 2014 }}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Latvian cuisine}}
Latvian cuisine typically consists of agricultural products, with meat featuring in most main meal dishes. Fish is commonly consumed due to Latvia's location on the Baltic Sea. Latvian cuisine has been influenced by the neighbouring countries. Common ingredients in Latvian recipes are found locally, such as potatoes, wheat, barley, cabbage, onions, eggs, and pork. Latvian food is generally quite fatty, and uses few spices.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/660594947|title=The cuisine of Latvia|last=Maija.|first=Auliciema, Marianna|last2=Raimonds.|first2=Cerūzis,|date=2004|publisher=Latvian Institute|isbn=998473627X|oclc=660594947}}</ref>

'''Solomon Islands''' is a [[sovereign state]] consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in [[Oceania]] lying to the east of [[Papua New Guinea]] and northwest of [[Vanuatu]] and covering a land area of {{convert|28400|km2|sqmi}}. The country's capital, [[Honiara]], is located on the island of [[Guadalcanal]]. The country takes its name from [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|the Solomon Islands archipelago]], which is a collection of [[Melanesia]]n islands that also includes the [[North Solomon Islands]] (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as [[Rennell and Bellona Province|Rennell and Bellona]], and the [[Santa Cruz Islands]].

The islands have been inhabited for thousands of years. In 1568, the Spanish navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña]] was the first European to visit them, naming them the ''Islas Salomón''.<ref name="Princeton University Library">{{cite web|url=http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/pacific/mendana-queiros/mendana-queiros.html|title=Alvaro de Mendaña de Neira, 1542?–1595|publisher=Princeton University Library|accessdate=8 February 2013}}</ref> Britain defined its area of interest in the Solomon Islands archipelago in June 1893, when Captain Gibson R.N., of {{HMS|Curacoa|1878|6}}, declared the southern Solomon Islands a [[British protectorate]].<ref name="BRL6">{{cite book |last1= Lawrence |first1= David Russell |authorlink1= |title= The Naturalist and his "Beautiful Islands": Charles Morris Woodford in the Western Pacific|url= |format= |accessdate=  |year= October 2014|publisher=ANU Press |location= |language= |isbn=9781925022032|oclc=  |doi= |id= |page=|pages= |chapter= Chapter 6 The British Solomon Islands Protectorate: Colonialism without capital  |chapterurl= http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p298111/pdf/ch063.pdf|quote= |ref= |bibcode= }}</ref><ref>''Commonwealth and Colonial Law'' by Kenneth Roberts-Wray, London, Stevens, 1966.

The official name of the then British administration was changed from "[[British Solomon Islands|the British Solomon Islands Protectorate]]" to "the Solomon Islands" in 1975, and self-government was achieved the year after. Independence was obtained in 1978 and the name changed to just "Solomon Islands", without the "the". At independence, Solomon Islands became a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The [[Monarchy of Solomon Islands|Queen of Solomon Islands]] is [[Elizabeth II]], represented by her [[Governor-General of Solomon Islands|governor-general]], Sir [[Frank Kabui]]. The [[Prime Minister of Solomon Islands|prime minister]] is [[Rick Houenipwela]].

==Name==

In 1568, the Spanish navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña]] was the first European to visit the Solomon Islands archipelago, naming it ''Islas Salomón'' ("Solomon Islands") after the wealthy [[biblical]] [[King Solomon]].<ref name="Princeton University Library"/> It is said that they were given this name in the mistaken assumption that they contained great riches,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1978/apr/27/solomon-islands-bill-hl|title=Lord GORONWY-ROBERTS, speaking in the House of Lords, HL Deb 27 April 1978 vol 390 cc2003-19|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> and he believed them to be the Bible-mentioned city of [[Ophir]].<ref>HOGBIN, H. In, ''Experiments in Civilization: The Effects of European Culture on a Native Community of the Solomon Islands'', New York: Schocken Books, 1970 (1939), pp.7-8</ref>

During most of the period of British rule the territory was officially named "the British Solomon Islands Protectorate".<ref name="ReferenceA">British Solomon Islands (Name of Territory) Order 1975 (S.I. 1975 No. 808)</ref> On 22 June 1975 the territory was renamed "the Solomon Islands".<ref name="ReferenceA"/> When Solomon Islands became independent in 1978, the name was changed to "Solomon Islands". The definite article, "the", is not part of the country's official name but is sometimes used, both within and outside the country.

==History==
{{main|History of Solomon Islands}}
[[File:Solomon Islands canoe crop.jpg|thumb|left|Solomon Island warriors, armed with spears, on board an ornamented war canoe (1895).]]

===Early history===
It is believed that [[East Papuan languages|Papuan]]-speaking settlers began to arrive around 30,000&nbsp;BC.<ref>Sheppard, Peter J. "Lapita Colonization Across the Near/Remote Boundary" ''Current Anthropology'', Vol 53, No. 6 (Dec 2011), p. 800</ref> [[Austronesia]]n speakers arrived c.&nbsp;4000&nbsp;BC also bringing cultural elements such as the [[outrigger canoe]]. Between 1200 and 800 BC the ancestors of the [[Polynesia]]ns, the [[Lapita]] people, arrived from the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] with their characteristic [[ceramic]]s.<ref>[[Patrick Vinton Kirch|Kirch, Patrick Vinton]] (2002).

Berkeley, California: University of California Press. {{ISBN|0-520-23461-8}}</ref>

===European contact (1568)===
{{Main|German New Guinea|British Western Pacific Territories|British Solomon Islands}}

The first European to visit the islands was the Spanish navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira]], coming from [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]] in 1568.

Some of the earliest and most regular foreign visitors to the islands were [[whaling]] vessels from Britain, the United States and Australia.<ref>Robert Langdon (ed.) ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', (1984), Camberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, pp.229-232 {{ISBN|0-86784-471-X}}.</ref> They came for food, wood and water from late in the 18th century and, later, took aboard islanders to serve as crewmen on their ships.<ref>Judith A. Bennett, ''Wealth of the Solomons: a history of a Pacific archipelago, 1800-1978'', (1987), Honolulu, University of Hawaii Press, pp.24-31 & Appendix 3.{{ISBN|0-8248-1078-3}}</ref> Relations between the islanders and visiting seamen was not always good and sometimes there was violence and bloodshed.<ref>Bennett, 27-30; Mark Howard, "Three Sydney whaling captains of the 1830s," ''The Great Circle'', 40 (2) December 2018, 83-84.</ref>

Missionaries began visiting the Solomons in the mid-19th century. They made little progress at first, because "[[blackbirding]]" (the often brutal recruitment or kidnapping of labourers for the [[sugar plantation]]s in [[Queensland]] and [[Fiji]]) led to [[List of massacres in the Solomon Islands|a series of reprisals and massacres]]. The evils of the slave trade prompted the United Kingdom to declare a protectorate over the southern Solomons in June 1893.<ref>[http://motherearthtravel.com/solomon_islands/history.htm "History of the Solomon Islands".] Retrieved 10 December 2013</ref>

In 1898 and 1899, more outlying islands were added to the protectorate; in 1900 the remainder of the archipelago, [[North Solomon Islands|an area previously under German jurisdiction]], was transferred to British administration, apart from the islands of [[Buka Island|Buka]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]], which remained under German administration as part of [[German New Guinea]]. Traditional trade and social intercourse between the western Solomon Islands of Mono and Alu (the Shortlands) and the traditional societies in the south of Bougainville, however, continued without hindrance.

Missionaries settled in the Solomons under the protectorate, converting most of the population to Christianity. In the early 20th century several British and Australian firms began large-scale coconut planting. Economic growth was slow, however, and the islanders benefited little.

Journalist [[Joe Melvin]] visited in 1892, as part of his undercover investigation into blackbirding. In 1908 the islands were visited by [[Jack London]], who was cruising the Pacific on his boat, the ''Snark''.

===Second World War===
{{main|Solomon Islands campaign|Battle of Guadalcanal}}
[[File:USS Enterprise (CV-6) under attack and burning during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August 1942 (NH 97778).jpg|thumb|The aircraft carrier {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6}} under aerial attack during the [[Battle of the Eastern Solomons]].]]
With the outbreak of the Second World War most planters and traders were evacuated to Australia and most cultivation ceased. Some of the most intense fighting of the war occurred in the Solomons. The most significant of the Allied Forces' operations against the [[Japanese Imperial]] Forces was launched on 7 August 1942, with simultaneous naval bombardments and amphibious landings on the [[Florida Islands]] at [[Tulagi]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mylescfoxdd829.net/TulagiBattle.htm |title=The Tulagi Battle |publisher=Mylescfoxdd829.net |date=7 August 1942 |accessdate=7 July 2011}}</ref> and Red Beach on [[Guadalcanal]].

The [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Battle of Guadalcanal]] became an important and bloody campaign fought in the Pacific War as the Allies began to repulse the Japanese expansion. Of strategic importance during the war were the [[coastwatchers]] operating in remote locations, often on Japanese held islands, providing early warning and intelligence of Japanese naval, army and aircraft movements during the campaign.<ref>[https://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2002/aug/guadalcanal/index.html The Battle for Guadalcanal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021140657/http://www.npr.org/programs/re/archivesdate/2002/aug/guadalcanal/index.html |date=21 October 2013 }}. NPR: National Public Radio.</ref>

Sergeant-Major [[Jacob Vouza]] was a notable coastwatcher who, after capture, refused to divulge Allied information in spite of interrogation and torture by Japanese Imperial forces. He was awarded a [[Silver Star]] Medal by the Americans, which is the United States' third-highest decoration for valor in combat.

Islanders [[Biuku Gasa and Eroni Kumana]] were the first to find the shipwrecked [[John F. Kennedy]] and his crew of the [[Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109|PT-109]]. They suggested writing a rescue message on a coconut, and delivered the coconut by paddling a dugout canoe. The coconut was later kept on Kennedy's desk when he became [[President of the United States]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/why-jfk-kept-coconut-shell-white-house-desk-180964263/ | title=Why JFK Kept a Coconut Shell in the Oval Office|magazine=Smithsonian Magazine |date= August 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.jfklibrary.org/Asset-Viewer/RlXdfYlMAUasL4z6S3vyCg.aspx | title=Coconut Bearing Rescue Message, MO 63.4852 | website=JOHN F.

The Solomon Islands was one of the major staging areas of the South Pacific and was home to the famous [[VMA-214|VMF-214 "Black Sheep" Squadron]] commanded by [[Pappy Boyington|Major Greg "Pappy" Boyington]]. "The Slot" was a name for [[New Georgia Sound]], when it was used by the [[Tokyo Express]] to supply the Japanese garrison on Guadalcanal. Of more than 36,000 Japanese on Guadalcanal, about 26,000 were killed or missing, 9,000 died of disease, and 1,000 were captured.<ref>Elmer Belmont Potter, Roger Fredland, Henry Hitch Adams (1981) [https://books.google.com/books?id=zql2rWh6QAsC&pg=PA310 Sea power: a naval history]. Naval Institute Press {{ISBN|0-87021-607-4}} p. 310</ref>

===Independence (1978)===
Local councils were established in the 1950s as the islands stabilised from the aftermath of the Second World War. A new constitution was established in 1970 and elections were held, although the constitution was contested and a new one was created in 1974. In 1973 the first oil price shock occurred, and the increased cost of running a colony became apparent to British administrators.

Following the independence of neighbouring [[Papua New Guinea]] from Australia in 1975, the Solomon Islands gained self-government in 1976. Independence was granted on 7 July 1978. The first Prime Minister was Sir [[Peter Kenilorea]], and Solomon Islands retained the Monarchy.

In September 2012, the [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Duke]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Duchess]] of Cambridge visited the islands to mark the 60th anniversary of the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.<ref>{{cite news|last1=English|first1=Rebecca|title=Carnival Kate met by crowd of 70,000|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2203983/Kate-Middleton-met-crowd-70-000-William-parade-streets-canoe-float.html|work=Daily Mail|location=London|date=16 September 2012}}</ref>

===Ethnic violence (1998–2003)===
Commonly referred to as ''the tensions'' or ''the ethnic tension'', the initial civil unrest was mainly characterised by fighting between the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (also known as the Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army) and the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (as well as the Marau Eagle Force). (Although much of the conflict was between Guales and Malaitans, Kabutaulaka (2001)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rspas.anu.edu.au/papers/melanesia/working_papers/tarcisiusworkingpaper.htm |title=Cap – Anu |publisher=Rspas.anu.edu.au |date=14 December 2012 |accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> and Dinnen (2002) argue that the 'ethnic conflict' label is an oversimplification.)

In late 1998, militants on the island of Guadalcanal began a campaign of intimidation and violence towards Malaitan settlers. During the next year, thousands of Malaitans fled back to Malaita or to the capital, Honiara (which, although situated on Guadalcanal, is predominantly populated by Malaitans and Solomon Islanders from other provinces). In 1999, the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) was established in response.

The reformist government of [[Bartholomew Ulufa'alu]] struggled to respond to the complexities of this evolving conflict. In late 1999, the government declared a four-month state of emergency. There were also a number of attempts at reconciliation but to no avail. Ulufa'alu also requested assistance from Australia and New Zealand in 1999 but his appeal was rejected.

In June 2000, Ulufa'alu was kidnapped by militia members of the MEF who felt that, although he was a Malaitan, he was not doing enough to protect their interests. Ulufa'alu subsequently resigned in exchange for his release. [[Manasseh Sogavare]], who had earlier been Finance Minister in Ulufa'alu's government but had subsequently joined the opposition, was elected as Prime Minister by 23–21 over [[Leslie Boseto|Rev. Leslie Boseto]]. However Sogavare's election was immediately shrouded in controversy because six MPs (thought to be supporters of Boseto) were unable to attend parliament for the crucial vote (Moore 2004, n.5 on p.&nbsp;174).

In October 2000, the [[Townsville Peace Agreement]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |title=THE TOWNSVILLE PEACE AGREEMENT |date=2000-10-15 |website=Commerce.gov.sb |accessdate=2016-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210034717/http://www.commerce.gov.sb/Gov/Peace_Agreement.htm |archivedate=10 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> was signed by the Malaita Eagle Force, elements of the IFM, and the Solomon Islands Government. This was closely followed by the Marau Peace agreement in February 2001, signed by the Marau Eagle Force, the Isatabu Freedom Movement, the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, and the Solomon Islands Government. However, a key Guale militant leader, [[Harold Keke]], refused to sign the agreement, causing a split with the Guale groups. Subsequently, Guale signatories to the agreement led by Andrew Te'e joined with the Malaitan-dominated police to form the 'Joint Operations Force'. During the next two years the conflict moved to the Weathercoast of Guadalcanal as the Joint Operations unsuccessfully attempted to capture Keke and his group.

New elections in December 2001 brought [[Allan Kemakeza]] into the Prime Minister's chair with the support of his People's Alliance Party and the Association of Independent Members. Law and order deteriorated as the nature of the conflict shifted: there was continuing violence on the Weathercoast while militants in Honiara increasingly turned their attention to crime and extortion. The Department of Finance would often be surrounded by armed men when funding was due to arrive. In December 2002, Finance Minister [[Laurie Chan]] resigned after being forced at gunpoint to sign a cheque made out to some of the militants. Conflict also broke out in Western Province between locals and Malaitan settlers. Renegade members of the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) were invited in as a protection force but ended up causing as much trouble as they prevented.

The prevailing atmosphere of lawlessness, widespread extortion, and ineffective police prompted a formal request by the Solomon Islands Government for outside help. With the country bankrupt and the capital in chaos, the request was unanimously supported in Parliament.

In July 2003, Australian and Pacific Island police and troops arrived in Solomon Islands under the auspices of the Australian-led [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI). A sizeable international security contingent of 2,200 police and troops, led by Australia and New Zealand, and with representatives from about 20 other Pacific nations, began arriving the next month under [[Operation Helpem Fren]]. Since this time some commentators have considered the country a [[failed state]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031110092412/http://www.pacificislands.cc/pina/pinadefault.php?urlpinaid=9609|title=Pacific Islands: PINA and Pacific|date=10 November 2003|publisher=}}</ref> However, other academics argue that rather than being a 'failed state', it is an unformed state: a state that never consolidated even after decades of independence.<ref>Pillars and Shadows: Statebuilding as Peacebuilding in Solomon Islands, J. Braithwaite, S. Dinnen, M.Allen, V. Braithwaite & H. Charlesworth, Canberra, ANU E Press: 2010.</ref>

In April 2006, allegations that the newly elected Prime Minister [[Snyder Rini]] had used bribes from Chinese businessmen to buy the votes of members of Parliament led to mass rioting in the capital [[Honiara]]. A deep underlying resentment against the minority [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] business community led to much of [[Chinatown]] in the city being destroyed.<ref name=BBC/> Tensions were also increased by the belief that large sums of money were being exported to China. China sent chartered aircraft to evacuate hundreds of Chinese who fled to avoid the riots. Evacuation of Australian and British citizens was on a much smaller scale. Additional Australian, New Zealand and Fijian police and troops were dispatched to try to quell the unrest. Rini eventually resigned before facing a motion of no-confidence in Parliament, and Parliament elected [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as Prime Minister.

Solomon Islands is a [[constitutional monarchy]] and has a [[parliamentary system]] of government. As [[Queen of Solomon Islands]], [[Elizabeth II]] is [[head of state]]; she is represented by the [[Governor-General of Solomon Islands|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Parliament for a five-year term. There is a [[unicameral]] parliament of 50 members, elected for four-year terms. However, Parliament may be dissolved by majority vote of its members before the completion of its term.

Parliamentary representation is based on single-member constituencies. Suffrage is universal for citizens over age 21.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bp.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Solomon Islands|publisher=|accessdate=19 November 2014}}</ref> The [[head of government]] is the [[Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands|Prime Minister]], who is elected by Parliament and chooses the cabinet. Each ministry is headed by a cabinet member, who is assisted by a [[permanent secretary]], a career public servant who directs the staff of the ministry.

Solomon Islands governments are characterised by weak political parties (see [[List of political parties in Solomon Islands]]) and highly unstable parliamentary coalitions. They are subject to frequent [[votes of no confidence]], leading to frequent changes in government leadership and cabinet appointments.

Land ownership is reserved for Solomon Islanders. The law provides that resident expatriates, such as the Chinese and [[Kiribati]], may obtain citizenship through naturalisation. Land generally is still held on a family or village basis and may be handed down from mother or father according to local custom. The islanders are reluctant to provide land for nontraditional economic undertakings, and this has resulted in continual disputes over land ownership.

No military forces are maintained by Solomon Islands although a police force of nearly 500 includes a border protection unit. The police also are responsible for fire service, disaster relief, and maritime surveillance. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the governor-general and responsible to the prime minister. On 27 December 2006, the Solomon Islands Government took steps to prevent the country's Australian police chief from returning to the Pacific nation. On 12 January 2007, Australia replaced its top diplomat expelled from Solomon Islands for political interference in a conciliatory move aimed at easing a four-month dispute between the two countries.

On 13 December 2007, Prime Minister [[Manasseh Sogavare]] was toppled by a vote of no confidence in Parliament,<ref>Sireheti, Joanna., & Joy Basi, – [http://www.solomontimes.com/news.aspx?nwID=1090 "Solomon Islands PM Defeated in No-Confidence Motion"], – ''Solomon Times'', – 13 December 2007</ref> following the defection of five ministers to the opposition. It was the first time a prime minister had lost office in this way in Solomon Islands. On 20 December, Parliament elected the opposition's candidate (and former Minister for Education) [[Derek Sikua]] as Prime Minister, in a vote of 32 to 15.<ref>Tuhaika, Nina., – [http://www.solomontimes.com:80/news.aspx?nwID=1130 "New Prime Minister for Solomon Islands"], – ''Solomon Times'', – 20 December 2007</ref><ref>[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/s2123875.htm "Solomon Islands parliament elects new PM"], – [[ABC Radio Australia]], – 20 December 2007</ref>

===Judiciary===
{{main| Judiciary of Solomon Islands}}
The Governor General appoints the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court on the advice of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. The Governor General appoints the other justices with the advice of a judicial commission. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] (based in the United Kingdom) serves as the highest appellate court.{{contradict-inline|Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Judiciary of Solomon Islands|date=February 2018}} The current Chief Justice is Sir Albert Palmer.

Since March 2014 Justice Edwin Goldsbrough has served as the President of the Court of Appeal for Solomon Islands. Justice Goldsbrough has previously served a five-year term as a Judge of the High Court of Solomon Islands (2006–2011). Justice Edwin Goldsbrough then served as the Chief Justice of the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]].<ref name="TCCJ">{{cite web| last = Boyce | first = Hayden| title= Turks & Caicos Islands Chief Justice Edwin Goldsbrough Resigns | publisher= Turks & Caicos Sun|date= 20 September 2014|url= http://suntci.com/turks-caicos-islands-chief-justice-edwin-goldsbrough-resigns-p1128-108.htm |accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Solomon Islands}}

Solomon Islands is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Interpol]], [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], [[Pacific Islands Forum]], [[South Pacific Commission]], [[International Monetary Fund]], and the [[ACP countries|African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries]] (ACP) ([[Lomé Convention]]).

The political stage of Solomon Islands was influenced by its position regarding [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|the Republic of China]] (ROC) and [[Foreign relations of China|the People's Republic of China]] (PRC). Solomon Islands gave [[diplomatic recognition]] to the Republic of China (Taiwan),<ref>{{cite web |title= Wooing the Islands: China and Taiwan High Stakes Bid for Pacific Island Support |first= Andrew |last= Vltchek |work= Japan Focus |date= 20 April 2008 |accessdate= 23 November 2013 |url= http://www.japanfocus.org/-Andre-Vltchek/2727 }}</ref> recognising it as the sole-legitimate government of all of China, thus giving [[Taiwan]] vital votes in the United Nations. Lucrative investments, political funding and preferential loans from both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China have increasingly manipulated the political landscape of the Solomon Islands.

Relations with [[Papua New Guinea]], which had become strained because of an influx of refugees from the [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] rebellion and attacks on the northern islands of Solomon Islands by elements pursuing Bougainvillean rebels, have been repaired. A 1998 peace accord on Bougainville removed the armed threat, and the two nations regularised border operations in a 2004 agreement.

===Military===
Although the locally recruited [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate Defence Force]] was part of [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] taking part in fighting in the Solomons during the Second World War, the country has not had any regular military forces since independence. The various paramilitary elements of the [[Royal Solomon Islands Police Force]] (RSIPF) were disbanded and disarmed in 2003 following the intervention of the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] ([[RAMSI]]). RAMSI has a small military detachment headed by an Australian commander with responsibilities for assisting the police element of RAMSI in internal and external security. The RSIPF still operates two [[Pacific class patrol boat]]s (RSIPV ''Auki'' and RSIPV ''Lata''), which constitute the de facto navy of Solomon Islands.

In the long term, it is anticipated that the RSIPF will resume the defence role of the country. The police force is headed by a commissioner, appointed by the [[governor general]] and responsible to the Minister of Police, National Security & Correctional Services.

The police budget of Solomon Islands has been strained due to a four-year civil war. Following [[Cyclone Zoe]]'s strike on the islands of [[Tikopia]] and [[Anuta]] in December 2002, Australia had to provide the Solomon Islands government with 200,000 Solomon dollars ($50,000 Australian) for fuel and supplies for the patrol boat ''Lata'' to sail with relief supplies. (Part of the work of RAMSI includes assisting the Solomon Islands government to stabilise its budget.)

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Provinces of Solomon Islands}}

For local government, the country is divided into ten administrative areas, of which nine are provinces administered by elected provincial assemblies and the tenth is the capital Honiara, administered by the Honiara Town Council.

===Human rights===
{{See also|Human rights in Solomon Islands}}
There are human rights concerns and issues in regards to education, water, sanitation, women, and domestic violence.

==Geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
{{main|Geography of Solomon Islands}}
[[File:East Rennell-112643.jpg|thumb|left|[[UNESCO]] declared [[East Rennell]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 1998.]]
[[File:Solomon Isles.jpg|right|thumb|Aerial view of Solomon Islands.]]
[[File:Medium shot of idyllic villages beach near Auki, the capital of Malaita. (10702263414).jpg|thumb|[[Malaita]] island]]

Solomon Islands is an island nation that lies east of [[Papua New Guinea]] and consists of many islands: [[Choiseul Island|Choiseul]], the [[Shortland Islands]]; the [[New Georgia Islands]]; [[Santa Isabel Island|Santa Isabel]]; the [[Russell Islands]]; [[Nggela]] (the [[Florida Islands]]); [[Malaita]]; [[Guadalcanal (Pacific Ocean island)|Guadalcanal]]; [[Sikaiana]]; [[Maramasike]]; [[Ulawa]]; [[Uki Island|Uki]]; [[Makira]] ([[San Cristobal (Solomon Islands)|San Cristobal]]); [[Santa Ana (Solomon Islands)|Santa Ana]]; [[Rennell and Bellona]]; the [[Santa Cruz Islands]] and the remote, tiny outliers, [[Tikopia]], [[Anuta]], [[Fatutaka]] and [[Falkie Atoll]].

The country's islands lie between latitudes [[5th parallel south|5°]] and [[13th parallel south|13°S]], and longitudes [[155th meridian east|155°]] and [[169th meridian east|169°E]]. The distance between the westernmost and easternmost islands is about 1,500 kilometres (930&nbsp;mi). The Santa Cruz Islands (of which Tikopia is part) are situated north of [[Vanuatu]] and are especially isolated at more than 200 kilometres (120&nbsp;mi) from the other islands. [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] is geographically part of the Solomon Islands archipelago but politically part of Papua New Guinea. Falkie Atoll, which is closer to Bougainville than to Choiseul, is part of the nation of Solomon Islands.

=== Climate ===
The islands' ocean-equatorial climate is extremely humid throughout the year, with a mean temperature of {{convert|26.5|C|F}} and few extremes of temperature or weather. June through August is the cooler period. Though seasons are not pronounced, the northwesterly winds of November through April bring more frequent rainfall and occasional squalls or cyclones. The annual rainfall is about {{convert|3050|mm|in}}.

=== Ecology ===
The Solomon Islands [[archipelago]] is part of two distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s. Most of the islands are part of the [[Solomon Islands rain forests]] ecoregion, which also includes the islands of Bougainville and Buka; these forests have come under pressure from forestry activities. The Santa Cruz Islands are part of the [[Vanuatu rain forests]] ecoregion, together with the neighbouring archipelago of Vanuatu. Soil quality ranges from extremely rich volcanic (there are [[volcano]]es with varying degrees of activity on some of the larger islands) to relatively infertile limestone. More than 230 varieties of orchids and other tropical flowers brighten the landscape.

The islands contain several active and dormant volcanoes. The Tinakula and [[Kavachi]] volcanoes are the most active.

=== Water and sanitation ===

''See also:'' ''[[Human rights in Solomon Islands]]''

Scarcity of fresh water sources and lack of sanitation has been a constant challenge facing Solomon Islands. Reducing the number of those living without access to fresh water and sanitation by half was one of the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (MDG's) implemented by the United Nations through Goal 7, to ensure environmental sustainability.<ref name="Sectors">{{Cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthofnations.org/sectors-solomon_islands/business/water_and_sanitation/|title=Sectors|website=Commonwealth of Nations|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> Though the islands generally have access to fresh water sources, it is typically only available in the state's capital of Honiara,<ref name="Sectors"/> and it is not guaranteed all year long. According to a UNICEF report, even the capital's poorest communities do not have access to adequate places to relieve their waste, and an estimated 70% Solomon Island schools have no access to safe and clean water for drinking, washing and relieving of waste.<ref name="Sectors"/> Lack of safe drinking water in school-age children results in high risks of contracting fatal diseases such as cholera and typhoid.<ref name="reliefweb.int">{{Cite web|url=https://reliefweb.int/report/solomon-islands/solomon-island-communities-build-potable-water-systems-improve-livelihoods|title=Solomon Island Communities Build Potable Water Systems to Improve Livelihoods - Solomon Islands|website=ReliefWeb|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> The number of Solomon Islanders living with piped drinking water has been decreasing since 2011, while those living with non-piped water increased between 2000 and 2010. Nevertheless, one improvement is that those living with non-piped water has been decreasing consistently since 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://washdata.org/data#!/slb|title=JMP|website=washdata.org|access-date=2018-10-18}}</ref>

In addition, the Solomon Islands Second Rural Development Program, enacted in 2014 and active until 2020, has been working to deliver competent infrastructure and other vital services to rural areas and villages of the Solomon Islands,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.projects.worldbank.org/P149282?lang=en|title=Projects : Solomon Islands Rural Development Program II {{!}} The World Bank|website=www.projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2018-12-04}}</ref> which suffer the most from lack of safe drinking water and proper sanitation. Through improved infrastructure, services and resources, the program has also encouraged farmers and other agricultural sectors, through community-driven efforts, to connect them to the market, thus promoting economic growth.<ref name="reliefweb.int"/> Rural villages such as Bolava, found in the Western Province of Solomon Islands, have benefited greatly from the program, with the implementation of water tanks and rain catchment and water storage systems.<ref name="reliefweb.int"/> Not only has the improved infrastructure increased the quality of life in Solomon Islands, the services are also operated and developed by the community, thus creating a sense of communal pride and achievement among those previously living in hazardous conditions. The program is funded by various international development actors such as the World Bank, European Union, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the Australian and Solomon Islands governments.<ref name="reliefweb.int"/>

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Solomon Islands}}{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}
Solomon Islands' per-capita GDP of $600 ranks it as a lesser developed nation, and more than 75% of its labour force is engaged in subsistence and fishing. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. Until 1998, when world prices for tropical timber fell steeply, timber was Solomon Islands' main export product, and, in recent years, Solomon Islands forests were dangerously [[Deforestation|overexploited]].

Other important cash crops and exports include [[copra]] and [[palm oil]]. In 1998 gold mining began at [[Gold Ridge (mine)|Gold Ridge]] on Guadalcanal. Minerals exploration in other areas continued. In the wake of the ethnic violence in June 2000, exports of palm oil and gold ceased while exports of timber fell. The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, [[zinc]], nickel, and gold.

Solomon Islands' fisheries also offer prospects for export and domestic economic expansion. A Japanese joint venture, Solomon Taiyo Ltd., which operated the only fish cannery in the country, closed in mid-2000 as a result of the ethnic disturbances. Though the plant has reopened under local management, the export of tuna has not resumed. Negotiations are underway that may lead to the eventual reopening of the Gold Ridge mine and the major oil-palm plantation.

Tourism, particularly diving, is an important service industry for Solomon Islands. Tourism growth is hampered by lack of infrastructure and transportation limitations.

The Solomon Islands Government was insolvent by 2002. Since the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|RAMSI]] intervention in 2003, the government has recast its budget. It has consolidated and renegotiated its domestic debt and with Australian backing, is now seeking to renegotiate its foreign obligations. Principal aid donors are Australia, New Zealand, the European Union, Japan, and the Republic of China, Taiwan.

Recently,{{When|date=January 2015}} Solomon Islands courts have re-approved the export of live dolphins for profit, most recently to Dubai, United Arab Emirates. This practice was originally stopped by the government in 2004 after international uproar over a shipment of 28 live dolphins to Mexico. The move resulted in criticism from both Australia and New Zealand as well as several conservation organisations.

The [[Solomon Islands dollar]] ([[ISO 4217]] code: ''SBD'') was introduced in 1977, replacing the Australian Pound Sterling. Its symbol is "SI$", but the "SI" prefix may be omitted if there is no confusion with other currencies also using the [[dollar sign]] "$". It is subdivided into 100 [[Cent (currency)|cents]]. Local [[shell money]] is still important for traditional and ceremonial purposes in certain provinces and, in some remote parts of the country, for trade. Shell money was a widely used traditional currency in the Pacific Islands, in Solomon Islands, it is mostly manufactured in [[Malaita]] and [[Guadalcanal]] but can be bought elsewhere, such as the [[Honiara Central Market]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pilotguides.com/articles/currency-as-cultural-craft-shell-money/|title=Currency as Cultural Craft: Shell Money – The Official Globe Trekker Website|work=The Official Globe Trekker Website|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref> The [[barter]] system often replaces money of any kind in remote areas.

===Energy===
A team of renewable energy developers working for the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) and funded by the [[Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership]] (REEEP), have developed a scheme that allows local communities to access renewable energy, such as solar, water and wind power, without the need to raise substantial sums of cash. Under the scheme, islanders who are unable to pay for solar lanterns in cash may pay instead in kind with crops.<ref>[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/04/solomon-islands-solar-a-new-microfinance-concept-takes-root Solomon Islands Solar: A New Microfinance Concept Takes Root].

=== Languages ===
{{Further|Languages of Solomon Islands}}

While English is the official language, only 1–2% of the population are able to communicate fluently in English. However, an English creole, Solomons [[Pijin]], is a ''de facto'' [[lingua franca]] of the country spoken by the majority of the population, along with local tribal languages. Pijin is closely related to [[Tok Pisin]] spoken in [[Papua New Guinea]].

The number of local languages listed for Solomon Islands is 74, of which 70 are living languages and 4 are extinct, according to ''Ethnologue, Languages of the World''.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=SB Ethnologue report for Solomon Islands]. Ethnologue.com. Retrieved 24 September 2010.</ref> [[Melanesian languages]] (predominantly of the [[Southeast Solomonic languages|Southeast Solomonic group]]) are spoken on the central islands.

[[Polynesian languages]] are spoken on [[Rennell Island|Rennell]] and [[Bellona Island|Bellona]] to the south, [[Tikopia]], [[Anuta]] and [[Fatutaka]] to the far east, [[Sikaiana]] to the north east, and Luaniua to the north ([[Ontong Java Atoll]], also known as [[Lord Howe Atoll]]). The immigrant population of Gilbertese ([[Kiribati|i-Kiribati]]) speaks a [[Micronesian language]].

===Religion===
{{main|Religion in Solomon Islands}}

The religion of Solomon Islands is mainly Christian (comprising about 92% of the population). The main Christian denominations are: the Anglican [[Church of the Province of Melanesia|Church of Melanesia]] 35%, [[Roman Catholic]] 19%, [[South Seas Evangelical Church]] 17%, [[United Church in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands]] 11% and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] 10%. Other Christian denominations are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], New Apostolic Church (80 churches) and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

Another 5% adhere to aboriginal beliefs. The remaining adhere to [[Islam]], the [[Baha'i Faith]]. According to the most recent reports, [[Islam in Solomon Islands]] is made up of approximately 350 Muslims,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90154.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2007 |publisher=State.gov |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref> including members of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ahmadiyya.org.au/index.asp?docname=sol/maini.htm |title=Ahmadiyya Solomon Islands |publisher=Ahmadiyya.org.au |accessdate=7 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322163506/http://ahmadiyya.org.au/index.asp?docname=sol%2Fmaini.htm |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Solomon Islands}}
[[File:Malaitan Chief.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Malaita]]n Chief.]]
The [[culture of Solomon Islands]] reflects the extent of the differentiation and diversity among the groups living within the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands archipelago]], which lies within [[Melanesia]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], with the peoples distinguished by island, language, topography, and geography. The cultural area includes the nation state of Solomon Islands and the [[Bougainville Island]], which is a part of [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-15896396|title=Solomon Islands country profile|date=2017-07-31|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref>

Solomon Islands includes some [[Polynesian culture|culturally Polynesian]] societies which lie outside the main region of Polynesian influence, known as the [[Polynesian Triangle]]. There are seven [[Polynesian outliers]] within the Solomon Islands: [[Anuta]], [[Bellona Island|Bellona]], [[Ontong Java]], [[Rennell Island|Rennell]], [[Sikaiana]], [[Tikopia]], and [[Vaeakau-Taumako]].

In the traditional culture of Solomon Islands, age-old customs are handed down from one generation to the next, allegedly from the ancestral spirits themselves, to form the cultural values of Solomon Islands.

===Media===
;Radio
Radio is the most influential type of media in Solomon Islands due to language differences, illiteracy,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/country_profiles/1249307.stm |title=Solomon Islands country profile |publisher=BBC News |date= |accessdate=2016-12-09}}</ref> and the difficulty of receiving television signals in some parts of the country. The [[Solomon Islands Broadcasting Corporation]] (SIBC) operates public radio services, including the national stations ''[[Radio Happy Isles]]'' 1037 on the dial and ''[[Wantok FM]]'' 96.3, and the provincial stations ''[[Radio Happy Lagoon]]'' and, formerly, ''Radio Temotu''. There are two commercial FM stations, Z FM at 99.5 in Honiara but receivable over a large majority of island out from Honiara, and, PAOA FM at 97.7 in Honiara (also broadcasting on 107.5 in Auki), and, one community FM radio station, Gold Ridge FM on 88.7.

;Newspapers
There is one daily newspaper ''[[Solomon Star]]'' and one daily online news website ''Solomon Times Online (www.solomontimes.com)'', two weekly papers ''Solomons Voice'' and ''Solomon Times'', and two monthly papers ''Agrikalsa Nius'' and the ''Citizen's Press''.

;Television
There are no TV services that cover the entire Solomon Islands, but satellite TV stations can be received. However, in Honiara, there is a free-to-air channel called One Television, and rebroadcast [[ABC Asia Pacific]] (from Australia's ABC) and [[BBC World News]]. As of Dec 2010, residents could subscribe to SATSOL, a digital pay TV service, re-transmitting satellite television.

=== Cultural issues/concerns ===
Solomon Islands has one of the highest rates of family and sexual violence (FSV) in the world with 64% of women aged 15–49 having reported physical and/or sexual abuse by a partner.<ref name="Ming 2016 16–19">{{Cite journal|last=Ming|first=Mikaela A.|last2=Stewart|first2=Molly G.|last3=Tiller|first3=Rose E.|last4=Rice|first4=Rebecca G.|last5=Crowley|first5=Louise E.|last6=Williams|first6=Nicola J.|date=2016|title=Domestic violence in the Solomon Islands|journal=Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care|volume=5|issue=1|pages=16–19|doi=10.4103/2249-4863.184617|issn=2249-4863|pmc=4943125|pmid=27453837}}</ref> As per a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) report issued in 2011, "the causes of Gender Based Violence (GBV) are multiple, but it primarily stems from gender inequality and its manifestations."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/sdhconference/resources/draft_background_paper4_solomon_islands.pdf|title=WHO 2011 report on gender based violence report in the Solomon Islands|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The report stated: 
:"In Solomon Islands, GBV has been largely normalized: 73% of men and 73% of women believe violence against women is justifiable, especially for infidelity and “disobedience,” as when women do “not live up to the gender roles that society imposes.” For example, women who believed they could occasionally refuse sex were four times more likely to experience GBV from an intimate partner. Men cited acceptability of violence and gender inequality as two main reasons for GBV, and almost all of them reported hitting their female partners as a “form of discipline,” suggesting that women could improve the situation by “[learning] to obey [them].”

Another manifestation and driver of gender inequality in Solomon Islands is the traditional practice of [[Bride price#Solomon Islands|bride price]]. Although specific customs vary between communities, paying a bride price is considered similar to a property title, giving men ownership over women. Gender norms of masculinity tend to encourage men to “control” their wives, often through violence, while women felt that bride prices prevented them from leaving men." Another report issued by the WHO in 2013 painted a similarly grim picture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/topics/gender/solomon_country_case_vaw.pdf|title=WHO Solomon Islands GBV report 2013|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

In 2014, Solomon Islands officially launched the Family Protection Act 2014 aimed at curbing domestic violence in the country.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/programmes/datelinepacific/audio/201796330/solomon-islands-launches-new-domestic-violence-law|title=Solomon Islands launches new domestic violence law|date=2016-04-08|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2017-09-28}}</ref> While numerous other interventions are being developed and implemented in the healthcare system as well as the criminal justice system, these interventions are still in their infancy and have largely stemmed from Western protocols. Therefore, for these models to be effective, time and commitment is needed to change the cultural perception of domestic violence in Solomon Islands.<ref name="Ming 2016 16–19"/>

==Etymology==
The Republic of Kenya is named after Mount Kenya. The earliest recorded version of the modern name was written by German explorer [[Johann Ludwig Krapf]] in the 19th century. While travelling with a Kamba caravan led by the legendary long distance trader Chief Kivoi, Krapf spotted the mountain peak and asked what it was called. Kivoi told him "''Kĩ-Nyaa''" or "''Kĩĩma- Kĩĩnyaa''" probably because the pattern of black rock and white snow on its peaks reminded them of the feathers of the cock ostrich.<ref name="sullivan">{{Cite book |last = Sullivan |first = Paul |year = 2006 |title = Kikuyu Districts |publisher = Mkuki na Nyota Publishers |location = Dar es Salaam, Tanzania}}</ref> The Agikuyu, who inhabit the slopes of Mt. Kenya, call it Kĩrĩma Kĩrĩnyaga in [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]], while the Embu call it "Kirenyaa." All three names have the same meaning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kenyaembassy.com/aboutkenyahistory.html|title=History|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref>

Ludwig Krapf recorded the name as both ''Kenia'' and ''Kegnia''.<ref name="Krapf">{{cite book| last=Krapf | first=Johann Ludwig | authorlink=Johann Ludwig Krapf| title= Travels, Researches, and Missionary Labours in Eastern Africa| year=1860 | publisher=Frank Cass & Co.

Kenya as Mt. Kenia, 1862.<ref name="sullivan" /> The mountain's name was accepted, [[pars pro toto]], as the name of the country. It did not come into widespread official use during the early colonial period, when the country was instead referred to as the [[East Africa Protectorate|East African Protectorate]]. It was changed to the [[Kenya Colony|Colony of Kenya]] in 1920.

{{Main|History of Kenya}}

===Prehistory===
[[File:Turkana Boy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|left|The [[Turkana boy]], a 1.6-million-year-old [[hominid]] fossil belonging to ''[[Homo erectus]]''.]]

Fossils found in Kenya suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago. Recent findings near [[Lake Turkana]] indicate that [[hominid]]s such as ''[[Homo habilis]]'' (1.8 and 2.5 million years ago) and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (1.9 million to 350,000 years ago) are possible direct ancestors of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', and lived in Kenya in the [[Pleistocene]] epoch.<ref name="Isaac"/>

During excavations at Lake Turkana in 1984, paleoanthropologist [[Richard Leakey]] assisted by [[Kamoya Kimeu]] discovered the [[Turkana Boy]], a 1.6-million-year-old fossil belonging to ''Homo erectus''. Previous research on early hominids is particularly identified with [[Mary Leakey]] and [[Louis Leakey]], who were responsible for the preliminary archaeological research at [[Olorgesailie]] and [[Hyrax Hill]]. Later work at the former site was undertaken by [[Glynn Isaac]].<ref name="Isaac">{{cite book|last=Glynn Llywelyn Isaac|first=Barbara Isaac|title=Olorgesailie: archeological studies of a Middle Pleistocene lake basin in Kenya|year=1977|publisher=University of Chicago Press|page=xiii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qwEoAQAAMAAJ}}</ref>

The first inhabitants of present-day Kenya were [[hunter-gatherer]] groups, akin to the modern [[Khoisan]] speakers.<ref name="EhretC18">Ehret, C.

Remarkable prehistoric sites in the interior of Kenya include the archaeoastronomical site [[Namoratunga]] on the west side of [[Lake Turkana]] and the walled settlement of ThimLich Ohinga in [[Migori County]].

===Swahili culture and trade (1st century–19th century)===
{{Further|Swahili culture|Sultanate of Zanzibar}}
[[File:Lamu door.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[Swahili culture|Swahili]] carved wooden door in [[Lamu]].]]

The Kenyan coast had served host to communities of [[ironwork]]ers and communities of Bantu subsistence farmers, hunters and fishers who supported the economy with agriculture, fishing, metal production and trade with foreign countries. These communities formed the earliest city states in the region which were collectively known as [[Azania]].<ref name="pbs.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wonders/fr_e2.htm |title=Wonders of the African World |publisher=[[PBS]] |accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref>

By the 1st century CE, many of the [[city-states]] such as [[Mombasa]], [[Malindi]], and [[Zanzibar]] began to establish trade relations with [[Arabs]]. This led to the increased economic growth of the Swahili states, introduction of [[Islam]], [[Arabic]] influences on the Swahili [[Bantu language]], [[cultural diffusion]], as well as the Swahili city-states becoming a member of a larger trade network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swahilihub.com/JifunzeKiswahili/-/1306806/1333292/-/jbyx02z/-/index.html |title=History and Origin of Swahili – Jifunze Kiswahili |publisher=swahilihub.com |date= |accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="Nanjira">Don Nanjira, Daniel (2010) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LZuxGsXVPoMC&printsec=frontcover ''African Foreign Policy and Diplomacy: From Antiquity to the 21st century''], ABC-CLIO, p. 114 {{ISBN|0-313-37982-3}}.</ref> Many historians had long believed that the city states were established by Arab or Persian traders, but archeological evidence has led scholars to recognize the city states as an indigenous development which, though subjected to foreign influence due to trade, retained a Bantu cultural core.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Spear, Thomas|year=2000|title=Early Swahili History Reconsidered|journal=The International Journal of African Historical Studies|volume=33|issue=2|pages=257–290|jstor=220649|doi=10.2307/220649}}</ref>

The [[Kilwa Sultanate]] was a medieval [[sultanate]], centred at [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] in modern-day [[Tanzania]].

Later on in the 17th century, once the Swahili coast was conquered and came under direct rule of [[Omani Arabs]], the [[Arab slave trade|slave trade]] was expanded by the [[Omani Arabs]] to meet the demands of plantations in [[Oman]] and [[Zanzibar]].<ref>"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548305/slavery/24157/Slave-societies Slavery (sociology)]".

''National Geographic''.</ref>  In addition, the Portuguese started buying slaves from the Omani and Zanzibari traders in response to the interruption of the transatlantic slave trade by British abolitionists.

Swahili, a Bantu language with [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and other Middle Eastern and South Asian [[loanword]]s, later developed as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' for trade between the different peoples.<ref name="pbs.org"/> Swahili now also has loan words from English.

Throughout the centuries, the Kenyan Coast has played host to many merchants and explorers. Among the cities that line the Kenyan coast is the City of Malindi. It has remained an important Swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivalled Mombasa for dominance in the African Great Lakes region. Malindi has traditionally been a friendly port city for foreign powers. In 1414, the Chinese trader and explorer [[Zheng He]] representing the [[Ming Dynasty]] visited the East African coast  [[Treasure voyages|on one of his last 'treasure voyages']].<ref>{{cite web|title=PBS website|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/ancient/ancient-chinese-explorers.html|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> Malindi authorities welcomed the Portuguese explorer [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1498.

===British Kenya (1888–1962)===

[[File:Africa 1909 16a.png|thumb|[[British East Africa]] in 1909]]

The colonial history of Kenya dates from the establishment of a [[German Empire|German]] protectorate over the Sultan of [[Zanzibar]]'s coastal possessions in 1885, followed by the arrival of the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] in 1888. Imperial rivalry was prevented when Germany handed its coastal holdings to Britain in 1890. This was followed by the building of the [[Uganda Railway|Kenya–Uganda railway]] passing through the country.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</ref>

The building of the railway was resisted by some ethnic groups—notably the [[Nandi people|Nandi]] led by ''[[Orkoiyot]]'' [[Koitalel Arap Samoei]] for ten years from 1890 to 1900—however the British eventually built the railway. The ''Nandi'' were the first ethnic group to be put in a native reserve to stop them from disrupting the building of the railway.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/>

During the railway construction era, there was a significant inflow of Indian people, who provided the bulk of the skilled manpower required for construction.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005">[[R. Mugo Gatheru]] (2005) ''Kenya: From Colonization to Independence, 1888–1970'', McFarland, {{ISBN|0-7864-2199-1}}</ref> They and most of their descendants later remained in Kenya and formed the core of several distinct Indian communities such as the [[Ismailism|Ismaili Muslim]] and [[Sikh]] communities.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jenkins, Orville Boyd  |url=http://orvillejenkins.com/profiles/sikh.html |title=Sikh |publisher=Orvillejenkins.com |accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref>

While building the railway through [[Tsavo]], a number of the Indian railway workers and local African labourers were attacked by two [[lions]] known as the [[Tsavo maneaters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magicalkenya.com/default.nsf/doc21/4YQ4W3FZEI64?opendocument&l=1&e=7&s=1 |title=Ismaili muslim |publisher=Magicalkenya.com |accessdate=16 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103151208/http://www.magicalkenya.com/default.nsf/doc21/4YQ4W3FZEI64?opendocument&l=1&e=7&s=1 |archivedate= 3 January 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>

At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the governors of [[British East Africa]] (as the protectorate was generally known) and [[German East Africa]] agreed a truce in an attempt to keep the young colonies out of direct hostilities. [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck|Lt. Col. Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]] took command of the German military forces, determined to tie down as many British resources as possible. Completely cut off from [[Germany]], [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck|von Lettow]] conducted an effective [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign, living off the land, capturing British supplies, and remaining undefeated. He eventually surrendered in [[Northern Rhodesia]] (today Zambia) fourteen days after the Armistice was signed in 1918.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005"/>

[[File:Kurve bei Mombasa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Uganda Railway|Kenya–Uganda Railway]] near [[Mombasa]], about 1899.]]
To chase von Lettow, the British deployed the [[British Indian Army]] troops from [[British Raj|India]] but needed large numbers of porters to overcome the formidable logistics of transporting supplies far into the interior on foot. The [[Carrier Corps]] was formed and ultimately mobilised over 400,000 Africans, contributing to their long-term politicisation.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005"/>

In 1920, the East Africa Protectorate was turned into a colony and renamed Kenya for its highest mountain.<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/>

During the early part of the 20th century, the interior central highlands were settled by British and other European farmers, who became wealthy farming coffee and tea.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901759-3,00.html "We Want Our Country"]. ''Time''. 5 November 1965.</ref> (One depiction of this period of change from one colonist's perspective is found in the memoir ''[[Out of Africa]]'' by Danish author Baroness Karen von Blixen-Finecke, published in 1937.) By the 1930s, approximately 30,000 white settlers lived in the area and gained a political voice because of their contribution to the market economy.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005"/>

The central highlands were already home to over a million members of the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] people, most of whom had no land claims in European terms and lived as itinerant farmers. To protect their interests, the settlers banned the growing of coffee, introduced a hut tax, and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour. A massive exodus to the cities ensued as their ability to provide a living from the land dwindled.<ref name="R. Mugo Gatheru 2005"/> There were 80,000 [[whites in Kenya|white settlers]] living in Kenya in the 1950s.<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R-r3g6OdLEUC&pg=PA28 Kenya]''". Matthew Firestone (2009). p. 28. {{ISBN|1-74104-773-0}}</ref>

Throughout [[World War II]], [[Kenya in World War II|Kenya was]] an important source of manpower and agriculture for the United Kingdom. Kenya itself was the site of [[East African Campaign (World War II)|fighting]] between Allied forces and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] troops in 1940–41 when Italian forces invaded. [[Wajir]] and [[Malindi]] were bombed as well.

In 1952, [[Queen Elizabeth II|Princess Elizabeth]] and her husband [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]] were on holiday at the [[Treetops Hotel]] in Kenya when her father, [[King George VI]], died in his sleep. The young princess cut short her trip and returned home immediately to take her throne. She was crowned Queen Elizabeth II at Westminster Abbey in 1953 and as British hunter and conservationist [[Jim Corbett]] (who accompanied the royal couple) put it, she went up a tree in Africa a princess and came down a queen.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/the_queens_diamond_jubilee/9046958/Diamond-Jubilee-the-moment-that-Princess-Elizabeth-became-Queen.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Hugo | last=Vickers | title=Diamond Jubilee: the moment that Princess Elizabeth became Queen | date=29 January 2012}}</ref>

===Mau Mau Uprising===
{{Further|Mau Mau Uprising}}
[[File:Statue of Dedan Kimathi Nairobi, Kenya.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Dedan Kimathi]], a Kenyan rebel leader with the [[Mau Mau]] who fought against the British colonial system in the 1950s.]]

From October 1952 to December 1959, Kenya was in a state of emergency arising from the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau rebellion]] against British rule. The Mau Mau, also known as the Kenya Land and Freedom Army, were primarily members of the Kikuyu Group.

The governor requested and obtained British and African troops, including the [[King's African Rifles]]. The British began [[counter-insurgency]] operations. In May 1953, General Sir [[George Erskine]] took charge as commander-in-chief of the colony's armed forces, with the personal backing of [[Winston Churchill]].<ref name="Wunyabari O. Maloba 1993">Maloba, Wunyabari O. (1993) ''Mau Mau and Kenya: An Analysis of Peasant Revolt'', Indiana University Press, 0852557450.</ref>

The capture of Warũhiũ Itote (also known as [[General China]]) on 15 January 1954 and the subsequent interrogation led to a better understanding of the Mau Mau command structure for the British. [[Mau Mau Uprising#British gain the initiative|Operation Anvil]] opened on 24 April 1954, after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the War Council. The operation effectively placed Nairobi under military siege. Nairobi's occupants were screened and the Mau Mau supporters moved to [[detention camp]]s. The Home Guard formed the core of the government's strategy as it was composed of loyalist Africans, not foreign forces such as the [[British Army]] and King's African Rifles. By the end of the emergency, the Home Guard had killed 4,686 Mau Mau, amounting to 42% of the total insurgents.

The capture of [[Dedan Kimathi]] on 21 October 1956 in [[Nyeri]] signified the ultimate defeat of the Mau Mau and essentially ended the military offensive.<ref name="Wunyabari O. Maloba 1993"/> During this period, substantial governmental changes to land tenure occurred. The most important of these was the [[Swynnerton Plan]], which was used to both reward loyalists and punish Mau Mau.

===Independence===
[[File:Jomo Kenyatta.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The first President and founding father of Kenya, [[Jomo Kenyatta]].]]

The first direct elections for native Kenyans to the Legislative Council took place in 1957. Despite British hopes of handing power to "moderate" local rivals, it was the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) of [[Jomo Kenyatta]] that formed a government. The Colony of Kenya and the Protectorate of Kenya each came to an end on 12 December 1963 with independence being conferred on all of Kenya. The United Kingdom ceded sovereignty over the Colony of Kenya. The Sultan of Zanzibar agreed that simultaneous with independence for the Colony of Kenya, the Sultan would cease to have sovereignty over the Protectorate of Kenya so that all of Kenya would be one sovereign, independent state.<ref name="Kenneth Roberts-Wray 1966.

Kenyatta and his family were tied up with this corruption as they enriched themselves through the mass purchase of property after 1963.Their acquisitions in the Central, Rift Valley, and Coast Provinces aroused great anger among landless Kenyans. His family used his presidential position to circumvent legal or administrative obstacles to acquiring property. The Kenyatta family also heavily invested in the coastal hotel business, with Kenyatta personally owning the Leonard Beach Hotel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Boone|first=Catherine|date=April 2012|title=Land Conflict and Distributive Politics in Kenya|journal=African Studies Review|volume=55|issue=1|pages=75–103|doi=10.1353/arw.2012.0010|issn=0002-0206}}</ref>

===Moi era===
{{Further|Daniel arap Moi|Presidency of Daniel Moi|1978 Kenyan presidential election|1988 Kenyan general election|1992 Kenyan general election}}
Moi was Kenya's president from 1978 to 2002. At Kenyatta's death in 1978, [[Daniel arap Moi]] became President. Daniel arap Moi retained the Presidency, being unopposed in elections held in 1979, 1983 ([[snap election]]s) and 1988, all of which were held under the single party constitution. The 1983 elections were held a year early, and were a direct result of [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt|an abortive military coup attempt]] on 2 August 1982.

[[File:Moi and Bush.jpg|thumb|[[Daniel arap Moi]], Kenya's second President, and George W. Bush, 2001]]
The abortive coup was masterminded by a low ranked Air Force serviceman, Senior Private [[Hezekiah Ochuka]], and was staged mainly by enlisted men in the Air Force. The putsch was quickly suppressed by forces commanded by Chief of General Staff [[Mahamoud Mohamed]], a veteran Somali military official.<ref>{{cite book|title=Society|year=1992|publisher=Nyamora Communications Limited|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MctAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> They included the General Service Unit (GSU)—a paramilitary wing of the police—and later the regular police.

On the heels of the [[Garissa Massacre]] of 1980, Kenyan troops committed the [[Wagalla massacre]] in 1984 against thousands of civilians in [[Wajir County]]. An official probe into the atrocities was later ordered in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wagalla massacre: Raila Odinga orders Kenya probe|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12463001|accessdate=14 November 2013|publisher=BBC|date=11 February 2011}}</ref>

The election held in 1988 saw the advent of the ''mlolongo'' (queuing) system, where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of a secret ballot.<ref>Harden, Blaine (25 February 1988) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110215084715/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1241691.html Many Voters Stay Home as Kenya Drops Secret Ballot in Parliamentary Election], ''[[The Washington Post]]''.</ref> This was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and it led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform.

===Birth of multiparty politics and the demise of Moi era===
{{Further|multiparty politics in Kenya}}
Kenya became a multiparty state in 1991 after 26 years of being a single party state. On 28 October 1992, president Moi dissolved parliament, five months before the end of his term. As a result, preparations began for all elective seats in parliament as well as the president. The elections were scheduled to take place on 7 December 1992, but delays led to its postponement to 29 December the same year. Apart from KANU, the ruling party, other parties represented in the elections included [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy|FORD]] Kenya and FORD Asili. This election was marked by large-scale intimidation of opponents, as well as harassment of election officials. It resulted in an economic crisis propagated by ethnic violence as the president was accused of rigging electoral results to sustain power.<ref name="Keith">{{Cite book|title=Politics of the independence of Kenya|last=Keith.|first=Kyle|date=1999|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0333720080|oclc=795968156}}</ref><ref name="Goldsworthy">{{Cite journal|last=Goldsworthy|first=David|date=March 1982|title=Ethnicity and Leadership in Africa: the 'Untypical' Case of Tom Mboya|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=20|issue=1|pages=107|doi=10.1017/s0022278x00000082|issn=0022-278X}}</ref><ref name="ParliamentKe">{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/2167_92.htm|title=KENYA: parliamentary elections National Assembly, 1992|website=archive.ipu.org|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref> This election was a turning point for Kenya as it signified the beginning of the end of Moi's leadership and the rule of KANU.

The elections of 1992 market the beginning of multiparty politics after more than 25 years rule by KANU.<ref name="Keith"/> Following the skirmishes in the aftermath of the 1992 multiparty elections, 5,000 people were killed and a further 75,000 others displaced from their homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/73319/kenya-clashes-elections-and-land-church-keeps-watch-molo|title=Clashes, elections and land - church keeps watch in Molo|date=2007-07-19|website=IRIN|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref> In the next five years, many political alliances were formed in preparation for the next elections. In 1994, [[Jaramogi Oginga Odinga]] died and several coalitions joined his FORD Kenya party to form a new party called United National Democratic Alliance.

In 1995, [[Richard Leakey]] formed the Safina party, but it was denied registration until November 1997.<ref name="BBCKenyaHist">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13682176|title=Kenya profile|date=2018-01-31|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref>

In 1996, KANU revised the constitution to allow Moi to remain president for another term.

Moi's plan to be replaced by Uhuru Kenyatta failed, and [[Mwai Kibaki]], running for the opposition coalition "National Rainbow Coalition" ([[National Rainbow Coalition|NARC]]), was elected President. Anderson (2003) reports the elections were judged free and fair by local and international observers, and seemed to mark a turning point in Kenya's democratic evolution.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

In 2005, Kenyans rejected a plan to replace the 1963 independence constitution with a new one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmi.no/publications/2368-of-oranges-and-bananas|title=Of Oranges and Bananas: The 2005 Kenya Referendum on the Constitution|website=CMI – Chr.

Kibaki was re-elected in a highly contested political scene which was marked by [[2007–08 Kenyan crisis|political and ethnic violence]]. This resulted from accusations by the main opposition leader, Raila Odinga, that the election results were rigged and that he was the rightfully elected president. As a result, 1,500 people were killed and another 600,000 were internally displaced, making it the worst [[Civil unrest|post-election violence]] in Kenya. To stop the death and displacement of people, Kibaki and Raila agreed to work together, with the latter taking the position of a prime minister.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7344816.stm|title=Deal to end Kenyan crisis agreed|date=2008-04-12|access-date=2019-01-29}}</ref> This made Raila  [[Prime Minister of Kenya|the second prime minister of Kenya]].

===Devolution of government and separation of powers===

{{Further|Administrative divisions of Kenya|Constitution of Kenya|Presidency of Uhuru Kenyatta}}

Following the passage of the new constitution, Kenya became a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic, whereby the [[President of Kenya]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. The new constitution also states that [[executive power]]s are exercised by the executive branch of government, headed by the President, who chairs the cabinet, that is composed of people chosen from outside parliament. [[Legislative power]] is vested exclusively in [[Parliament of Kenya|Parliament]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. Mwai Kibaki became the first president to serve under this new constitution while Uhuru Kenyatta became the first president elected under this constitution.

===Climate===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Kenya's climate varies from tropical along the coast to temperate inland to [[arid]] in the north and northeast parts of the country. The area receives a great deal of sunshine every month, and summer clothes are worn throughout the year. It is usually cool at night and early in the morning inland at higher elevations.

The "long rains" season occurs from March/April to May/June. The "short rains" season occurs from October to November/December. The rainfall is sometimes heavy and often falls in the afternoons and evenings. The temperature remains high throughout these months of tropical rain. The hottest period is February and March, leading into the season of the long rains, and the coldest is in July, until mid August.

Kenya has considerable land area devoted to [[wildlife]] habitats, including the [[Masai Mara]], where [[Blue Wildebeest|blue wildebeest]] and other [[bovid]]s participate in a large scale [[Wikt:migration|annual migration]]. More than 1 million wildebeest and 200,000 zebras participate in the migration across the [[Mara River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/media/wildebeest-migration/|title=Wildebeest Migration|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=19 January 2012|website=National Geographic Society|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref>

The [[Big Five Game|"Big Five"]] game animals of Africa, that is the [[lion]], [[leopard]], [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[rhinoceros]], and [[African elephant|elephant]], can be found in Kenya and in the Masai Mara in particular. A significant population of other wild animals, reptiles and birds can be found in the [[List of national parks of Kenya|national parks]] and game reserves in the country. The annual animal migration occurs between June and September with millions of animals taking part, attracting valuable foreign tourism. Two million wildebeest migrate a distance of {{convert|2900|km|0|abbr=out}} from the [[Serengeti]] in neighbouring [[Tanzania]] to the Masai Mara<ref>{{cite web|title=Masai Mara|url=http://www.kenyatraveltips.com/masai-mara-safari.html}}</ref> in Kenya, in a constant clockwise fashion, searching for food and water supplies.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Kenya}}
[[File:Mwai Kibaki, October 2003.jpg|thumb|Kenya's third president [[Mwai Kibaki]]]]

Kenya is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] republic. The president is both the [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Kenya|National Assembly]] and the [[Senate of Kenya|Senate]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature. There was growing concern especially during former president Daniel arap Moi's tenure that the executive was increasingly meddling with the affairs of the judiciary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1448:mandatorydeathpenalty03&catid=140&Itemid=155&showall=&limitstart=11|title=The Criminal Justice System and Eroding Democracy After Independence – Page 12|last=Novak|first=Andrew|website=racism.org|access-date=13 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603102544/http://racism.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1448:mandatorydeathpenalty03&catid=140&Itemid=155&showall=&limitstart=11|archive-date=3 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Kenya has a high degree of corruption according to [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perception Index]] (CPI), a metric which attempts to gauge the prevalence of public sector corruption in various countries. In 2012, the nation placed 139th out of 176 total countries in the CPI, with a score of 27/100.<ref name="TICPI">{{cite web|title=Transparency International: CPI|url=http://www.transparency.org/country#KEN|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> However, there are several rather significant developments with regards to curbing corruption from the Kenyan government, for instance, the establishment of a new and independent Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).<ref>{{cite web|title=Business Corruption in Kenya|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/kenya/business-corruption-in-kenya.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>

In December 2002, Kenya held democratic and open elections, which were judged free and fair by most international observers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/international-observers-declare-kenyan-elections-fair-1.349882|title=International observers declare Kenyan elections fair|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref> The 2002 elections marked an important turning point in Kenya's democratic evolution in that power was transferred peacefully from the [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU), which had ruled the country since independence to the [[National Rainbow Coalition]] (NARC), a coalition of political parties.

===2013 elections and new government===
{{Main|Kenyan general election, 2013|Kenyan local elections, 2013}}

Under the new constitution and with President Kibaki prohibited by term limits from running for a third term, Deputy Prime Minister [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] ran for office. He won with 50.51% of the vote in March 2013.

In December 2014, President [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] signed a Security Laws Amendment Bill, which supporters of the law suggested was necessary to guard against armed groups. Opposition politicians, human rights groups, and nine Western countries criticised the security bill, arguing that it infringed on democratic freedoms. The governments of the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], and [[France]] also collectively issued a press statement cautioning about the law's potential impact. Through the Jubilee Coalition, the Bill was later passed on 19 December in the National Assembly under acrimonious circumstances.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kenya president signs tough 'anti-terror' law|url=https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/kenya-passes-divisive-anti-terror-law-090047236.html|accessdate=22 December 2014|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=19 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222200412/https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/kenya-passes-divisive-anti-terror-law-090047236.html|archivedate=22 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:President Obama visits Nairobi Kenya July 2015 (20848405843).jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] in Nairobi, July 2015]]
Kenya has close ties with its fellow [[Swahili language|Swahili]]-speaking neighbours in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Relations with Uganda and Tanzania are generally strong, as the three nations work toward economic and social integration through common membership in the [[East African Community]].

Relations with Somalia have historically been tense, although there has been some military co-ordination against Islamist insurgents.

The '''Kenya Defence Forces''' are the [[armed forces]] of the [[Republic of Kenya]]. The [[Kenya Army]], [[Kenya Navy]] and [[Kenya Air Force]] compose the National Defence Forces.

Kenya's armed forces, like many government institutions in the country, have been tainted by [[Corruption in Kenya|corruption]] allegations. Because the operations of the armed forces have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of "state security", the corruption has been hidden from public view, and thus less subject to public scrutiny and notoriety.

===Administrative divisions=== <!--Linked from [[Administrative divisions of Kenya]]-->
{{main|Counties of Kenya|Divisions of Kenya}}

Kenya is divided into [[Counties of Kenya|47 semi-autonomous counties]] that are headed by governors. These 47 counties now form the first-order divisions of Kenya.

The smallest administrative units in Kenya are called [[Locations of Kenya|locations]]. Locations often coincide with electoral wards. Locations are usually named after their central villages/towns. Many larger towns consist of several locations. Each location has a chief, appointed by the state.

Constituencies are an electoral subdivision, with each county comprising a whole number of constituencies. An Interim Boundaries commission was formed in year 2010 to review the constituencies and in its report, it recommended creation of an additional 80 constituencies. Previous to the 2013 elections, there were 210 [[Constituencies of Kenya|constituencies in Kenya]].<ref>Kenya Roads Board [https://web.archive.org/web/20080113052023/http://www.krb.go.ke/constituency.php Constituency funding under the RMLF]</ref>

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Kenya}}
[[File:Kenya Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Kenya's exports.]]
Kenya's [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] outlook has steadily posted robust growth over the past few decades. However, much of this growth comes from cash flows diverted from ordinary Kenyans at the [[Microeconomics|microeconomic]] level resulting in diminished incomes in ordinary low and middle-income homes and small businesses leading to widespread hardship and discontent across the country which frequently manifests as strikes and [[picketing]] especially in the [[public service]]. In 2014, the country's [[GDP]] was adjusted upwards causing it to be re-classified as a low-middle-income country.

Kenya has a [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) of 0.555(medium), ranked 145 out of 186 in the world. {{As of|2005}}, 17.7% of Kenyans lived on less than $1.25 a day. {{sfn|Ludeki Chweya|John Kithome Tuta|S.

Kenya is usually classified as a [[frontier market]] or occasionally an [[emerging market]], but it is not one of the [[least developed countries]].

The economy has seen much expansion, seen by strong performance in tourism, higher education and [[Telecommunications in Kenya|telecommunications]], and acceptable{{POV statement|date=January 2015}} post-drought results in agriculture, especially the vital tea sector.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> Kenya's economy grew by more than 7% in 2007, and its foreign debt was greatly reduced.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/> But this changed immediately after the disputed presidential election of December 2007, following the chaos which engulfed the country.

Telecommunication and financial activity over the last decade now comprises 62% of GDP. 22% of GDP still comes from the unreliable agricultural sector which employs 75% of the labour force (a consistent characteristic of under-developed economies that have not attained [[food security]]—an important catalyst of economic growth) A small portion of the population relies on food aid.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.usaid.gov/kenya/food-assistance|title=Food Assistance Fact Sheet – Kenya|website=www.usaid.gov|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref> Industry and manufacturing is the smallest sector, accounting for 16% of GDP.

Kenya also exports textiles worth over $400million under Agoa.

Privatisation of state corporations like the defunct Kenya Post and Telecommunications Company, which resulted in East Africa's most profitable company—[[Safaricom]], has led to their revival because of massive private investment.

{{as of|2011|May}}, economic prospects are positive with 4–5% GDP growth expected, largely because of expansions in [[tourism]], [[telecommunications]], transport, construction and a recovery in [[agriculture]].

In March 1996, the presidents of Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda re-established the [[East African Community]] (EAC). The EAC's objectives include harmonising tariffs and customs regimes, free movement of people, and improving regional infrastructures. In March 2004, the three East African countries signed a [[Customs union|Customs Union Agreement]].

Kenya is East and Central Africa's hub for financial services. The [[Nairobi Securities Exchange]] (NSE) is ranked 4th in Africa in terms of market capitalisation. The Kenyan banking system is supervised by the [[Central Bank of Kenya]] (CBK). As of late July 2004, the system consisted of 43 commercial banks (down from 48 in 2001), several [[non-bank financial institution]]s, including mortgage companies, four savings and loan associations, and several core foreign-exchange bureaus.<ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/>

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Kenya}}
[[File:Kenya-Tealand-Near-Kericho-2012.JPG|thumb|A Tea farm near [[Kericho]], [[Kericho County]].]]

Agriculture is the second largest contributor to Kenya's gross domestic product (GDP), after the service sector. In 2005 agriculture, including [[forestry]] and fishing, accounted for 24% of GDP, as well as for 18% of wage employment and 50% of revenue from exports. The principal [[cash crop]]s are tea, horticultural produce, and coffee. Horticultural produce and tea are the main growth sectors and the two most valuable of all of Kenya's exports. The production of major food staples such as [[Maize|corn]] is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations. Production downturns periodically necessitate food aid—for example, in 2004 aid for 1.8&nbsp;million people because of one of Kenya's intermittent [[droughts]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://wfp.org/news/news-release/drought-leaves-two-million-kenyans-need-food-aid | title=Drought leaves two million Kenyans in need of food aid | work=United Nations World Food Programme | date=26 April 2005 | accessdate=5 August 2016}}</ref>

A consortium led by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) has had some success in helping farmers grow new [[pigeon pea]] varieties, instead of maize, in particularly dry areas. Pigeon peas are very drought resistant, so can be grown in areas with less than 650&nbsp;mm annual rainfall. Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20–25% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.<ref>[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 Pigeonpea in Eastern and Southern Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718193632/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 |date=18 July 2014 }}.

Tea, coffee, sisal, pyrethrum, corn, and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands, one of the most successful agricultural production regions in Africa.<ref name=":0" /> Livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east. [[Coconuts]], [[pineapples]], [[cashew nuts]], cotton, [[sugarcane]], [[sisal]], and corn are grown in the lower-lying areas. Kenya has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty (53% of the population lives below the poverty line), a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid.<ref name=":1" /> Poor roads, an inadequate railway network, under-used water transport and expensive air transport have isolated mostly [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] areas and farmers in other regions often leave food to rot in the fields because they cannot access markets. This was last seen in August and September 2011 prompting the [[Kenyans for Kenya]] initiative by the [[Red Cross]].<ref>[http://conferences.ifpri.org/2020africaconference/program/day1summaries/kinyua.pdf Towards Achieving Food Security in Kenya].

[[File:Kapsowar1.JPG|thumb|Agricultural countryside in Kenya]]
Kenya's [[irrigation]] sector is categorized into three organizational types: smallholder schemes, centrally-managed public schemes and private/commercial irrigation schemes.

The smallholder schemes are owned, developed and managed by individuals or groups of farmers operating as water users or self-help groups. Irrigation is carried out on individual or on group farms averaging 0.1–0.4 ha. There are about 3,000 smallholder irrigation schemes covering a total area of 47,000 ha.
The country has seven large, centrally managed irrigation schemes, namely Mwea, [[Bura irrigation and Settlement Project (Kenya)|Bura]], [[Hola, Kenya|Hola]], [[Perkerra River|Perkera]], West Kano, Bunyala and [[Ahero]] covering a total commanded area of 18,200 ha and averaging 2,600 ha per scheme. These schemes are managed by the National Irrigation Board and account for 18% of irrigated land area in Kenya.
Large-scale private commercial farms cover 45,000 hectares accounting for 40% of irrigated land. They utilize high technology and produce high-value crops for the export market, especially flowers and vegetables.<ref>Republic of Kenya, Ministry of Water and Irrigation (2009) ''National Irrigation and Drainage Policy'':3–4.</ref>

Kenya is the world's 3rd largest exporter of [[cut flowers]].<ref name=kenya-flower-industry>{{cite web|last=Veselinovic |first=Milena |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/16/africa/kenya-flower-industry/ |title=Got roses this Valentine's Day?

===Industry and manufacturing===
[[File:Orrling of Nairobi.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Kenya Commercial Bank]] headquarters at [[KENCOM House]] (right) in Nairobi.]]
Although Kenya is the most industrially developed country in the [[African Great Lakes]] region, manufacturing still accounts for only 14% of the GDP. Industrial activity, concentrated around the three largest urban centres, [[Nairobi]], [[Mombasa]] and [[Kisumu]], is dominated by food-processing industries such as grain milling, beer production, and sugarcane crushing, and the fabrication of consumer goods, e.g., vehicles from kits.

There is a cement production industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.constructionkenya.com/2431/kenya-cement-industry-outlook/|title=Cement production keeps pace with growing demand|date=5 September 2015|website=Construction Business Review|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref> Kenya has an [[oil refinery]] that processes imported crude petroleum into petroleum products, mainly for the domestic market. In addition, a substantial and expanding [[informal sector]] commonly referred to as ''jua kali'' engages in small-scale manufacturing of household goods, auto parts, and farm implements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/features/WCMS_075529/lang--en/index.htm|title=Kenya: Employers' organizations taking the lead on linking the informal sector to formal Kenyan enterprises|date=2 August 2005|website=www.ilo.org|access-date=13 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mygov.go.ke/?p=5038|title=Jua Kali sector plays key role in economic development and job creation|date=13 November 2015|website=MyGov|access-date=13 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610135631/http://www.mygov.go.ke/?p=5038|archive-date=10 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Kenya's inclusion among the beneficiaries of the US Government's African Growth and Opportunity Act ([[AGOA]]) has given a boost to manufacturing in recent years. Since AGOA took effect in 2000, Kenya's clothing sales to the United States increased from US$44&nbsp;million to US$270&nbsp;million (2006).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brandkenya.go.ke/2012-12-16-16-05-26/75-industry|title=Industry|last=Kamau|first=Pithon|website=Brand Kenya Board|access-date=13 May 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604180631/http://www.brandkenya.go.ke/2012-12-16-16-05-26/75-industry|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Other initiatives to strengthen manufacturing have been the new government's favourable tax measures, including the removal of duty on capital equipment and other raw materials.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2010/138092.htm?goMobile=0 | title=Kenya | accessdate=10 June 2016}}</ref>

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Kenya}}
The country has an extensive network of paved and unpaved roads. Kenya's railway system links the nation's ports and major cities, connecting it with neighbouring Uganda. There are 15 airports which have paved runways.

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy in Kenya}}

The largest share of Kenya's electricity supply comes from geothermal energy<ref>[https://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/report/?country=Kenya&product=electricityandheat Electricity in Kenya] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180811133300/https://www.iea.org/statistics/statisticssearch/report/?country=Kenya&product=electricityandheat |date=11 August 2018 }}. IEA 2014</ref> followed by hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]], as well as the [[Turkwel Gorge Dam]] in the west. A petroleum-fired plant on the coast, [[Geothermal power in Kenya|geothermal facilities]] at [[Olkaria]] (near Nairobi), and electricity imported from [[Uganda]] make up the rest of the supply. Kenya's installed capacity stood at 1,142 [[megawatts]] between 2001 and 2003. The state-owned [[Kenya Electricity Generating Company|Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen)]], established in 1997 under the name of Kenya Power Company, handles the generation of electricity, while Kenya Power handles the electricity transmission and distribution system in the country. Shortfalls of electricity occur periodically, when drought reduces water flow. To become energy sufficient, Kenya aims to build a nuclear power plant by 2017.<ref>McGregor, Sarah (20 September 2010) [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-20/kenya-aims-to-build-a-nuclear-power-plant-by-2017-minister-nyoike-says.html Kenya Aims to Build a Nuclear Power Plant by 2017].

===Overall Chinese investment and trade===
Published comments on Kenya's [[98.4 Capital FM|Capital FM]] website by Liu Guangyuan, [[Chinese Ambassador to Kenya|China's ambassador to Kenya]], at the time of President Kenyatta's 2013 trip to Beijing, said, "Chinese investment in Kenya&nbsp;... reached $474 million, representing Kenya's largest source of foreign direct investment, and&nbsp;... bilateral trade&nbsp;... reached $2.84 billion" in 2012. Kenyatta was "[a]ccompanied by 60 Kenyan business people [and hoped to]&nbsp;... gain support from China for a planned $2.5 billion railway from the southern Kenyan port of Mombasa to neighboring [[Uganda]], as well as a nearly $1.8 billion dam", according to a statement from the president's office also at the time of the trip.<ref name=wp01/>

Base Titanium, a subsidiary of Base resources of Australia, shipped its first major consignment of minerals to China.

===Vision 2030===
[[File:Vision2030 logo.svg|thumb|The official logo of [[Kenya Vision 2030|Vision 2030]].]]

In 2007, the Kenyan government unveiled [[Kenya Vision 2030|Vision 2030]], an economic development programme it hopes will put the country in the same league as the [[Four Asian Tigers|Asian Economic Tigers]] by the year 2030. In 2013, it launched a National Climate Change Action Plan, having acknowledged that omitting climate as a key development issue in Vision 2030 was an oversight. The 200-page Action Plan, developed with support from the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], sets out the Government of Kenya's vision for a 'low carbon climate resilient development pathway'. At the launch in March 2013, the Secretary of the Ministry of Planning, National Development and Vision 2030 emphasised that climate would be a central issue in the renewed Medium Term Plan that would be launched in the coming months. This would create a direct and robust delivery framework for the Action Plan and ensure climate change is treated as an economy-wide issue.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/03/news-kenyas-national-climate-change-action-plan-is-officially-launched/ NEWS: Kenya's National Climate Change Action Plan is officially launched], Climate & Development Knowledge Network, 28 March 2013</ref>

Early in 2006 Chinese president [[Hu Jintao]] signed an oil exploration contract with Kenya, part of a series of deals designed to keep Africa's natural resources flowing to China's rapidly expanding economy.

The deal allowed for China's state-controlled offshore oil and gas company, [[China National Offshore Oil Corporation|CNOOC]], to prospect for oil in Kenya, which is just beginning to drill its first exploratory wells on the borders of Sudan and the disputed area of [[North Eastern Province, Kenya|North Eastern Province]] of the border with [[Somalia]] and in coastal waters. There are formal estimates of the possible reserves of oil discovered.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a51a39d2-280c-11db-b25c-0000779e2340.html|title=China's scramble for Africa finds a welcome in Kenya |last=Barber |first=Lionel |author2=England, Andrew  |date=10 August 2006|work=Financial Times |accessdate=27 June 2008}}</ref>

===Microfinance in Kenya===
{{Main|Microfinance in Kenya}}

24 institutions offer business loans on a large scale, specific agriculture loans, education loans, and for any other purpose loans. Additionally there are:
*emergency loans, which are more expensive in respect to interest rates, but are quickly available
*group loans for smaller groups (4–5 members) and larger groups (up to 30 members)
*women loans, which are also available to a group of women

Out of approximately 40 million [[Kenyans]], about 14 million Kenyans are not able to receive financial service through formal loan application service and an additional 12 million Kenyans have no access to financial service institutions at all. Further, 1 million Kenyans are reliant on informal groups for receiving financial aid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mfi-upgrading-initiative.org/000001985b0d93482/00000198660ae2e07/032d539c050945b02/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603203238/http://www.mfi-upgrading-initiative.org/000001985b0d93482/00000198660ae2e07/032d539c050945b02/index.html |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

'''Conditions for microfinance products'''
*Eligibility criteria: the general criteria might include gender as in the case for special women loans, to be at least 18 years old, to own a valid Kenyan ID, have a business, demonstrate the ability to repay the loan, and to be a customer of the institution.
*[[Credit scoring]]: there is no advanced credit scoring system and the majority has not stated any official loan distribution system. However, some institutions require to have an existing business for at least 3 months, own a small amount of cash, provide the institution with a business plan or proposal, have at least one [[guarantor]], or to attend group meetings or training. For group loans, almost half of the institutions require group members to guarantee for each other.
*[[Interest rate]]: they are mostly calculated on a flat basis and some at a declining balance. More than 90% of the institutions require monthly interest payments. The average interest rate is 30–40% for loans up to 500,000 Kenyan Shilling. For loans above 500,000 Kenyan Shilling, interest rates go up to 71%.

According to the [[Kenya National Bureau of Statistics]] (KNBS), Kenya has a total population of 38,610,097 inhabitants. The largest native ethnic groups are the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] (6,622,576), [[Luhya people|Luhya]] (5,338,666), [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] (4,967,328), [[Luo people|Luo]] (4,044,440), [[Kamba people|Kamba]] (3,893,157), [[Somalis]] (3,510,757), [[Kisii people|Kisii]] (2,205,669), [[Mijikenda peoples|Mijikenda]] (1,960,574), [[Meru people|Meru]] (1,658,108), [[Turkana people|Turkana]] (988,592), and [[Maasai people|Maasai]] (841,622).

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Kenya}}

Kenya's various ethnic groups typically speak their [[mother tongue]]s within their own communities. The two [[official language]]s, English and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], are used in varying degrees of fluency for communication with other populations. English is widely spoken in commerce, schooling and government.<ref name="Cugrwed">{{cite book|last=Proquest Info & Learning (COR)|title=Culturegrams: World Edition|year=2009|publisher=Proquest/Csa Journal Div|isbn=978-0-9778091-6-5|page=98}}</ref> [[Peri-urbanisation|Peri-urban]] and rural dwellers are less multilingual, with many in rural areas speaking only their native languages.<ref name="Broassim">{{cite book|author1=Brown, E.

[[British English]] is primarily used in Kenya.

There are a total of 69 languages spoken in Kenya. Most belong to two broad language families: [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] ([[Bantu languages|Bantu branch]]) and [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] ([[Nilotic languages|Nilotic branch]]), spoken by the country's Bantu and Nilotic populations, respectively.

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Kenya}}

[[File:Kapsowarhospital1.jpg|thumb|Outpatient Department of AIC Kapsowar Hospital<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kapsowarhospital.com/|title=AIC Mission Hospital Kapsowar Official Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> in [[Kapsowar]].]]

Kenya's [[private sector]] is one of the most advanced and dynamic in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Private healthcare businesses and companies are the main health care providers in the country even for the nation's poorest people. The private health sector is larger and more easily accessible than both the public and the non-profit  health sectors in terms of facilities and personnel. According to a World Bank report, nearly half of the poorest 20 percent of Kenyans use a private health facility when a child is sick.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/434701468048274776/Private-health-sector-assessment-in-Kenya|title=Private health sector assessment in Kenya|first1=Barnes|last1=Jeff|first2=O'Hanlon|last2=Barbara|first3=Feeley|last3=Frank|first4=McKeon|last4=Kimberly|first5=Gitonga|last5=Nelson|first6=Decker|last6=Caytie|date=7 June 2010|publisher=}}</ref>

Private health facilities are largely preferred for their strong brands, [[Value added|value-addition]] and patient-focused care in contrast to the minimalist evidence-based care provided in the mostly moribund public health facilities. Private health facilities are diverse and cater for all economic groups. Hospitals such as the [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|Aga Khan Hospital]] and the [[Mombasa Hospital]] are comparable to many preferred hospitals in the developed world but are expensive and accessible only to the rich and the insured. Many affordable and low-cost private medical institutions and clinics exist and are easily accessible to ordinary and [[middle-class]] residents but are commonly unregistered and unlicensed and run by similarly unregistered and unlicensed personnel posing a grave danger to the public. All registered medical facilities are subjected to regular supervisory and supportive visits from a joint multi-cadre team of health officials from the county government and national regulatory bodies in order to meet the legal threshold of the '''Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015''' and may choose to undergo additional supportive and quality assurance and improvement processes by operating under a social franchise such as the joint government-donor funded [[Population Services International|Tunza Family Network]].

The control of medical practice by laymen through limited liability companies, county governments and other artificial legal entities is widespread and largely tolerated unlike other countries where medical affairs are strictly handled by medical professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Licensees/Corporate_Practice.aspx|title=Corporate Practice - Licensees - Medical Board of California|first=Medical Board of|last=California|website=www.mbc.ca.gov}}</ref>

The health sector and health facilities are not protected by any special laws and are prone to mismanagement with health workers frequently being subjected to verbal, emotional and physical abuse by patients and administrators alike.

The public health sector consists of community-based (level I) services which are run by community health workers, dispensaries (level II facilities) which are run by nurses, health centers (level III facilities) which are run by clinical officers, sub-county hospitals (level IV facilities) which may be run by a clinical officer or a medical officer, county hospitals (level V facilities) which may be run by a medical officer or a medical practitioner, and national referral hospitals (level VI facilities) which are run by fully qualified medical practitioners (consultants and sub-specialists).

[[File:Table rco co mo medical practitioners.png|thumb|Table showing different grades of clinical officers, medical officers and medical practitioners in Kenya's public service]][[Nurses]] are by far the largest group of [[front-line]] health care providers in all sectors followed by [[clinical officer]]s, [[medical officer]]s and [[medical practitioner]]s. According to the [[Kenya National Bureau of Statistics]], in 2011 there were 65,000 qualified nurses registered in the country; 8,600 clinical officers and 7,000 doctors for the population of 43 million people (These figures from official registers include those who have died or left the profession hence the actual number of these workers may be lower).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knbs.or.ke/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&view=category&download=587:kenya-facts-and-figures-2014&id=20:kenya-facts-figures&Itemid=595.|title=Kenya Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref>

[[Traditional healer]]s ([[Herbalist]]s, [[witch doctor]]s and [[faith healer]]s) are readily available, trusted and widely consulted as practitioners of first or last choice by both rural and urban dwellers.

Despite major achievements in the health sector, Kenya still faces many challenges. The [[life expectancy]] estimate has dropped to approximately 55 years in 2009—five years below 1990 levels.<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/kenya_statistics.html#85 UNICEF Statistics: Kenya]. Unicef.org.</ref> The [[infant mortality]] rate is high at approximately 44 deaths per 1,000 children in 2012.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html?countryName=Kenya&countryCode=ke&regionCode=afr&rank=53#ke Infant Mortality ranks].

[[Diseases of poverty]] directly correlate with a country's [[economy|economic performance]] and [[wealth distribution]]: Half of Kenyans live below the poverty level. Preventable diseases like malaria, HIV/AIDS, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malnutrition are the biggest burden, major child-killers, and responsible for much morbidity; weak policies, corruption, inadequate health workers, weak management and poor leadership in the public health sector are largely to blame. According to 2009 estimates, [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|HIV/AIDS prevalence]] is about 6.3% of the adult population.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2155rank.html?countryName=Kenya&countryCode=ke&regionCode=afr&rank=11#ke CIA World Factbook: HIV/AIDS – Adult Prevalence Rate Rankings].

[[File:Community work in Kenya DVIDS342488.jpg|thumb|School children in a classroom.]]

[[File:MSc student at Kenyatta University.jpg|thumb|An MSc student at [[Kenyatta University]] in Nairobi.]]

Children attend nursery school, or kindergarten in the private sector until they are five years old. This lasts one to three years (KG1, KG2 and KG3) and is financed privately because there has been no government policy regarding it until recently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000188257/government-to-review-early-childhood-development-policy|title=Government to review Early Childhood Development policy|last=Reporter|first=Standard|website=Standard Digital News|access-date=23 June 2016}}</ref>

Basic formal education starts at age six years and lasts 12 years consisting of eight years in primary school and four years in high school or secondary school. Primary school is free in public schools and those attending can join a vocational youth/village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring, carpentry, motor vehicle repair, brick-laying and masonry for about two years.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://kenyapage.net/education/primary.html|title=Primary School Education in Kenya|website=kenyapage.net|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref>

Those who complete high school can join a [[Institute of technology|polytechnic]] or other technical college and study for three years, or proceed directly to the university and study for four years. Graduates from the polytechnics and colleges can then join the workforce and later obtain a specialized higher diploma qualification after a further one to two years of training, or join the university—usually in the second or third year of their respective course. The [[higher diploma]] is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor's degree and direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies is possible in some universities.

[[File:Masai girl at school doing maths.jpg|thumb|A Maasai girl at school.]]

Public universities in Kenya are highly commercialized institutions and only a small fraction of qualified high school graduates are admitted on limited government-sponsorship into programs of their choice. Most are admitted into the social sciences, which are cheap to run, or as self-sponsored students paying the full cost of their studies. Most qualified students who miss out opt for middle-level diploma programs in public or private universities, colleges, and polytechnics.

38.5 percent of the Kenyan adult population is illiterate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/home&id=31868&type=Document|title=Kenya National Adult Literacy Survey report|website=www.eldis.org|access-date=27 June 2016}}</ref> There are very wide regional disparities; for example, Nairobi had the highest level of literacy, 87.1 per cent, compared to North Eastern Province, the lowest, at 8.0 per cent. Preschool, which targets children from age three to five, is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to Standard One (First Grade). At the end of primary education, pupils sit the [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]] (KCPE), which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training.  The result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school.<ref name=":2" />

Primary school is for students aged 6/7-13/14 years. For those who proceed to the secondary level, there is a national examination at the end of Form Four&nbsp;– the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]] (KCSE), which determines those proceeding to the universities, other professional training or employment. Students sit [[examinations]] in eight subjects of their choosing. However, English, Kiswahili and mathematics are compulsory subjects.

The Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS), formerly the Joint Admissions Board (JAB),  is responsible for selecting students joining the public universities. Other than the public schools, there are many private schools, mainly in urban areas. Similarly, there are a number of [[international school]]s catering to various overseas educational systems.

Despite its impressive commercial approach and interests in the country, Kenya's [[academia]] and higher education system is notoriously rigid and disconnected from the needs of the local labour market and is widely blamed for the high number of unemployable and "half-baked" university graduates who struggle to fit in the modern workplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/news/Varsity-expansion-blamed-for-half-baked-graduates/539546-3354256-108r90o/index.html|title=Varsity expansion blamed for half-baked graduates|publisher=}}</ref>

The [[culture of Kenya]] consists of multiple traditions. Kenya has no single prominent culture that identifies it. It instead consists of the various cultures of the country's different communities.

Notable populations include the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] on the coast, several other [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] communities in the central and western regions, and Nilotic communities in the northwest. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] culture is well known to tourism, despite constituting a relatively small part of Kenya's population. They are renowned for their elaborate upper body adornment and jewellery.

Additionally, Kenya has an extensive music, television and theater scene.

{{Main|Kenyan literature}}
[[File:Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o (signing autographs in London).jpg|thumb|Kenyan author [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]].]]

[[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] is one of the best known writers of Kenya. His novel, ''[[Weep Not, Child]]'', is an illustration of life in Kenya during the British occupation. The story details the effects of the Mau Mau on the lives of Kenyans. Its combination of themes—[[colonialism]], education, and love—helped to make it one of the best-known novels in Africa.

[[M.G. Vassanji]]'s 2003 novel ''The In-Between World of Vikram Lall'' won the [[Scotiabank Giller Prize|Giller Prize]] in 2003. It is the fictional memoir of a Kenyan of Indian heritage and his family as they adjust to the changing political climates in colonial and post-colonial Kenya.

Since 2003, the literary journal ''[[Kwani?]]'' has been publishing Kenyan contemporary literature. Additionally, Kenya has also been nurturing emerging versatile authors such as Paul Kipchumba (Kipwendui, Kibiwott) who demonstrate pan-African outlook (see ''Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy'' (2017).<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy|publisher= Independently published |date=December 3, 2017|isbn = 978-1973456803}}</ref>

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Kenya}}
[[File:Juacali 2.jpg|thumb|Popular Kenyan musician [[Jua Cali]].]]

Kenya has a diverse assortment of popular music forms, in addition to multiple types of [[folk music]] based on the variety over 40 regional languages.<ref>[http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2007/04/article_0001.html On the Beat – Tapping the Potential of Kenya's Music Industry], [[WIPO]] Magazine (July 2007).</ref>

The drums are the most dominant [[musical instrument|instrument]] in popular Kenyan music. Drum beats are very complex and include both native rhythm and imported ones, especially the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[cavacha]] rhythm. Popular Kenyan music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts, and more recently, showy guitar solos as well. There are also a number of local hip-hop artists, including [[Jua Cali]] and afro-pop bands such as [[Sauti Sol]].

Lyrics are most often in Kiswahili or English. There is also some emerging aspect of [[Lingala language|Lingala]] borrowed from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] musicians. Lyrics are also written in local languages. Urban radio generally only plays English music, though there also exist a number of vernacular radio stations.

Zilizopendwa is a genre of local urban music that was recorded in the 1960s, 70s and 80s by musicians such as [[Daudi Kabaka]], [[Fadhili William]] and Sukuma Bin Ongaro, and is particularly revered and enjoyed by older people—having been popularised by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation's Kiswahili service (formerly called Voice of Kenya or VOK).

The isukuti is a vigorous dance performed by the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] sub-tribes to the beat of a traditional drum called the Isukuti during many occasions such as the birth of a child, marriage and funerals. Other traditional dances include the [[Ohangla]] among the [[Luo peoples|Luo]], [[Nzele]] among the [[Mijikenda peoples|Mijikenda]], [[Mugithi]] among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Taarab]] among the [[Swahili people|Swahili]].

Additionally, Kenya has a growing Christian gospel music scene. Prominent local gospel musicians include the [[Kenyan Boys Choir]].

[[Benga music]] has been popular since the late 1960s, especially in the area around [[Lake Victoria]]. The word ''benga'' is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music. Bass, guitar and percussion are the usual instruments.

[[File:2012 Olympics - Womens 5000m start 4.jpg|thumb|Jepkosgei Kipyego and Jepkemoi Cheruiyot at London 2012 Olympics 5,000 meters]]

Kenya is active in several sports, among them [[cricket]], [[rallying]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]] and [[boxing]]. The country is known chiefly for its dominance in [[middle-distance running|middle-distance]] and [[long-distance running|long-distance]] athletics, having consistently produced [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] champions in various distance events, especially in 800&nbsp;m, 1,500&nbsp;m, 3,000&nbsp;m steeplechase, 5,000&nbsp;m, 10,000&nbsp;m and the marathon. Kenyan athletes (particularly [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]) continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from [[Morocco]] and [[Ethiopia]] has reduced this supremacy. Kenya's best-known athletes included the four-time women's [[Boston Marathon]] winner and two-time world champion [[Catherine Ndereba]], 800m world record holder [[David Rudisha]], former [[Marathon (sport)|Marathon]] world record-holder [[Paul Tergat]], and [[John Ngugi]].

Kenya won several medals during the Beijing Olympics, six gold, four silver and four bronze, making it Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics. New athletes gained attention, such as [[Pamela Jelimo]], the women's 800m gold medalist who went on to win the [[IAAF Golden League]] jackpot, and [[Samuel Wanjiru]] who won the men's marathon. Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion [[Kipchoge Keino]] helped usher in Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion [[Henry Rono]]'s spectacular string of world record performances. Lately, there has been controversy in Kenyan athletics circles, with the defection of a number of Kenyan athletes to represent other countries, chiefly [[Bahrain]] and [[Qatar]].<ref name="IAAF">IAAF: [http://www.iaaf.net/mm/Document/imported/42196.pdf Changes of Allegiance 1998 to 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509091352/http://www.iaaf.net/mm/Document/imported/42196.pdf |date=9 May 2013 }}.</ref> The Kenyan Ministry of Sports has tried to stop the defections, but they have continued anyway, with [[Bernard Lagat]] the latest, choosing to represent the United States.<ref name="IAAF"/> Most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4566821.stm|title=Kenya examines track star defections|last=Mynott|first=Adam|date=20 May 2005|work=BBC News|access-date=10 June 2016|via=}}</ref> Decisions by the Kenyan government to tax athletes' earnings may also be a reason for defection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-athletics-kenya-taxes-idUSBREA0L1OM20140122|title=Furious Kenyans threaten to defect over taxes|last=|first=|date=22 January 2014|work=Reuters|access-date=10 June 2016|via=}}</ref> Some elite Kenyan runners who cannot qualify for their country's strong national team find it easier to qualify by running for other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mobile.nation.co.ke/Sports/Why+the+defections/-/1951244/1957996/-/format/xhtml/-/hpgsnf/-/index.html|title=Why the defections?|website=mobile.nation.co.ke|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref>

Kenya has been a dominant force in women's volleyball within Africa, with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kenyapage.net/commentary/kenya-sports-commentary/kenya-womens-volleyball-caps-four-decades-of-excellence/|title=Kenya women's volleyball caps three decades of excellence {{!}} Kenya Page Blog|website=kenyapage.net|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chimpreports.com/volleyball-kenya-crowned-african-nations-champions/|title=Volleyball: Champions Kenya Scoop Major Continental Awards {{!}}|website=www.chimpreports.com|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref> The women's team has competed at the Olympics and [[FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship|World Championships]] though without any notable success. Cricket is another popular sport, also ranking as the most successful team sport. [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]] has competed in the [[Cricket World Cup]] since [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]]. They upset some of the world's best teams and reached the semi-finals of the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003 tournament]]. They won the inaugural World Cricket League Division 1 hosted in Nairobi and participated in the World T20. They also participated in the [[ICC Cricket World Cup 2011]]. Their current captain is [[Rakep Patel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketkenya.co.ke/senior_men.php#&panel1-1|title=:: Cricket Kenya |website=www.cricketkenya.co.ke|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref>

Kenya is represented by [[Lucas Onyango]] as a professional rugby league player who plays with the English club [[Oldham R.L.F.C.|Oldham]]. Besides the former [[Super League]] team, he has played for the [[Widnes Vikings]] and rugby union with the [[Sale Sharks]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/sports/rugby/-/1106/629940/-/xq30p7z/-/index.html |title=Nakuru upset KCB in Kenya Cup |work=Daily Nation |date=25 July 2009 |accessdate=16 April 2010}}</ref> Rugby union is increasing in popularity, especially with the annual [[Safaricom Sevens|Safari Sevens]] tournament. The [[Kenya national rugby sevens team|Kenya Sevens team]] ranked 9th in IRB Sevens World Series for the 2006 season. In 2016, the team beat Fiji at the Singapore Sevens finals, making Kenya the second African nation after South Africa to win a World Series championship.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.supersport.com/rugby/sevens/news/160417/Kenya_win_Singapore_Sevens_title|title=Kenya win Singapore Sevens title|last=|first=|date=17 April 2016|work=SuperSport|access-date=10 June 2016|via=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/36067269|title=Kenya beat Fiji to win their first Sevens World Series title|website=BBC Sport|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-sevens/2016/04/17/hsbc-world-rugby-sevens-series-kenya-shock-fiji-and-win-maiden-t/|title=HSBC World Rugby Sevens Series: Kenya shock Fiji and win maiden title in Singapore|website=The Telegraph|access-date=10 June 2016}}</ref> [[Kenya national football team|Kenya]] was also a regional powerhouse in football.

In the motor rallying arena, Kenya is home to the world-famous [[Safari Rally]], commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world.<ref>The Auto Channel, 21 July 2001: [http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2001/07/22/025841.html FIA RALLY: Delecour takes points finish on Safari Rally debut]</ref> It was a part of the [[World Rally Championship]] for many years until its exclusion after the 2002 event owing to financial difficulties. Some of the best rally drivers in the world have taken part in and won the rally, such as [[Björn Waldegård]], [[Hannu Mikkola]], [[Tommi Mäkinen]], [[Shekhar Mehta]], [[Carlos Sainz]] and [[Colin McRae]]. Although the rally still runs annually as part of the Africa rally championship, the organisers are hoping to be allowed to rejoin the World Rally championship in the next couple of years.

Nairobi has hosted several major continental sports events, including the [[FIBA Africa Championship 1993]] where [[Kenya national basketball team|Kenya's national basketball team]] finished in the top four, its best performance to date.<ref>[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/sid/2405/tid/312/_/1993_African_Championship_for_Men_/index.html 1993 FIBA Africa Championship for Men], ARCHIVE.FIBA.COM.

===Cuisine===
[[File:Ugali & Sukuma Wiki.jpg|thumb|[[Ugali]] and [[sukuma wiki]], staples of Kenyan cuisine]]

Kenyans generally have three meals in a day—breakfast in the morning (''kiamsha kinywa''), lunch in the afternoon (''chakula cha mchana'') and supper in the evening (''chakula cha jioni'' or known simply as "chajio"). In between, they have the 10 o'clock tea (''chai ya saa nne'') and 4&nbsp;p.m. tea (''chai ya saa kumi''). Breakfast is usually tea or porridge with bread, [[chapati]], [[mahamri]], boiled sweet potatoes or [[Sweet potato|yams]]. [[Githeri]] is a common lunch time dish in many households while [[Ugali]] with vegetables, sour milk ([[Mursik]]), meat, fish or any other stew is generally eaten by much of the population for lunch or supper. Regional variations and dishes also exist.

In western Kenya: among the [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]], fish is a common dish; among the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] who dominate much of the Rift Valley Region, [[mursik]]—sour milk—is a major drink.

In cities such as [[Nairobi]], there are fast food restaurants, including [[Steers]], [[KFC]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/10/13223149-fast-food-finds-fans-in-sub-sahara-africa-where-obesity-problem-is-growing |title=Fast food finds fans in sub-Sahara Africa, where obesity problem is growing |publisher=NBC News |date=24 October 2012 |accessdate=26 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116210535/http://worldnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/10/13223149-fast-food-finds-fans-in-sub-sahara-africa-where-obesity-problem-is-growing |archivedate=16 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]].<ref>[http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Subway-to-open-first-Kenya-outlet-in-August/-/539552/1691534/-/bax3pa/-/index.html US fast food chain to open first Kenya outlet in August – Money Markets]. businessdailyafrica.com.

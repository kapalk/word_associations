The [[Supreme Revolutionary Council (Somalia)|Supreme Revolutionary Council]] seized power in 1969 and established the [[Somali Democratic Republic]]. Led by [[Mohamed Siad Barre]], this government later collapsed in 1991 as the [[Somali Civil War]] broke out. Various armed factions began competing for influence in the power vacuum, particularly in the south. During this period, due to the absence of a central government, Somalia was a "[[failed state]]", and residents returned to [[Xeer|customary]] and [[Sharia|religious law]] in most regions. A few [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous regions]], including the [[Somaliland]] and [[Puntland]] administrations, emerged in the north. The early 2000s saw the creation of fledgling interim federal administrations. The [[Transitional National Government]] (TNG) was established in 2000, followed by the formation of the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) in 2004, which reestablished national institutions such as the [[Military of Somalia|military]].<ref name="factbook">{{cite web|date=2018|access-date=4 November 2018|title=Somalia|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Langley, Virginia|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/so.html}}</ref><ref name="factbook"/><ref name="Nytsnnpm"/> In 2006, the TFG, assisted by Ethiopian troops, assumed control of most of the nation's southern conflict zones from the newly formed [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU).

In the [[Classical antiquity|classical era]], the [[Macrobians]], who may have been ancestral to Somalis, established a powerful tribal kingdom that ruled large parts of modern Somalia. They were reputed for their longevity and wealth, and were said to be the "tallest and handsomest of all men".<ref name="Wheeler pg 526">[https://archive.org/stream/geographyofherod00whee/geographyofherod00whee_djvu.txt The Geography of Herodotus: Illustrated from Modern Researches and Discoveries] by James Talboys Wheeler, pg 1xvi, 315, 526</ref> The Macrobians were warrior herders and seafarers. According to Herodotus' account, the [[Persian Emperor]] [[Cambyses II]], upon his [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|conquest of Egypt]] in 525 BC, sent ambassadors to Macrobia, bringing luxury gifts for the Macrobian king to entice his submission.

===Early modern era and the scramble for Africa===
{{Main|Geledi sultanate|Majeerteen Sultanate|Sultanate of Hobyo|Dervish movement (Somali)}}
[[File:Sayyid Mohammed Abdullah Hassan.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], leader of the [[Dervish movement (Somali)|movement]].]]
In the [[early modern]] period, successor states to the Adal Sultanate and Ajuran Sultanate began to flourish in Somalia. These included the [[Warsangali Sultanate]], the [[Bari, Somalia|Bari Dynasties]], the [[Sultanate of the Geledi]] (Gobroon dynasty), the [[Majeerteen Sultanate]] (Migiurtinia), and the [[Sultanate of Hobyo]] (Obbia). They continued the tradition of castle-building and seaborne trade established by previous Somali empires.

Sultan [[Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim]], the third Sultan of the House of Gobroon, started the golden age of the Gobroon Dynasty. His army came out victorious during the Bardheere Jihad, which restored stability in the region and revitalized the East African [[ivory trade]]. He also received presents from and had cordial relations with the rulers of neighbouring and distant kingdoms such as the Omani, [[Wituland|Witu]] and Yemeni Sultans.

Sultan Ibrahim's son [[Ahmed Yusuf (Gobroon)|Ahmed Yusuf]] succeeded him and was one of the most important figures in 19th-century East Africa, receiving tribute from Omani governors and creating alliances with important Muslim families on the East African coast. In northern Somalia, the Gerad Dynasty conducted trade with Yemen and Persia and competed with the merchants of the Bari Dynasty. The Gerads and the Bari Sultans built impressive palaces and fortresses and had close relations with many different empires in the Near East.

In the late 19th century, after the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884, European powers began the [[Scramble for Africa]], which inspired the Dervish leader [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]] to rally support from across the Horn of Africa and begin one of the longest colonial resistance wars ever. In several of his poems and speeches, Hassan emphasized that the British "have destroyed our religion and made our children their children" and that the Christian Ethiopians in league with the British were bent upon plundering the political and religious freedom of the Somali nation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Saadia Touval|title=Somali Nationalism: International Politics and the Drive for Unity in the Horn of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ycGAAAACAAJ|date=September 1999|publisher=Iuniverse Inc|isbn=978-1-58348-411-1|page=56}}</ref> He soon emerged as "a champion of his country's political and religious freedom, defending it against all Christian invaders".<ref>{{cite book |author1=[[Richard H.

Hassan issued a religious ordinance stipulating that any Somali national who did not accept the goal of unity of Somalia and would not fight under his leadership would be considered to be [[kafir]], or ''gaal''. He soon acquired weapons from the Ottoman Empire, Sudan, other Islamic and Arabian countries, and appointed ministers and advisers to administer different areas or sectors of Somalia. In addition, he gave a clarion call for Somali unity and independence, in the process organizing his forces.

[[File:Mogadishu1936.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central [[Mogadishu]] in [[Italian Somaliland]], 1936.]]
Hassan's Dervish movement had an essentially military character, and the Dervish revolt was fashioned on the model of a Salihiya brotherhood. It was characterized by a rigid hierarchy and centralization. Though Hassan threatened to drive the Christians into the sea, he executed the first attack by launching his first major military offensive with his 1,500 Dervish equipped with 20 modern rifles on the British soldiers stationed in the region. He repulsed the British in four expeditions and had relations with the [[Central Powers]] of the Ottomans and the Germans. In 1920, the Dervish movement collapsed after intensive aerial bombardments by Britain, and Dervish territories were subsequently turned into a protectorate.

The dawn of [[fascism]] in the early 1920s heralded a change of strategy for Italy, as the north-eastern sultanates were soon to be forced within the boundaries of ''La Grande Somalia'' according to the plan of Fascist Italy. With the arrival of Governor [[Cesare Maria De Vecchi]] on 15 December 1923, things began to change for that part of Somaliland known as [[Italian Somaliland]]. Italy had access to these areas under the successive protection treaties, but not direct rule.

The Fascist government had direct rule only over the [[Benadir]] territory. [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]], under [[Benito Mussolini]], attacked Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935, with an aim to colonize it. The invasion was condemned by the [[League of Nations]], but little was done to stop it or to liberate occupied Ethiopia. On 3 August 1940, Italian troops, including Somali colonial units, crossed from Ethiopia to [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|invade British Somaliland]], and by 14 August, succeeded in taking [[Berbera]] from the British.

A British force, including troops from several African countries, launched the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|campaign in January 1941]] from Kenya to liberate British Somaliland and Italian-occupied Ethiopia and conquer Italian Somaliland. By February, most of Italian Somaliland was captured and in March, British Somaliland was retaken from the sea. The forces of the British Empire operating in Somaliland comprised the three divisions of South African, West African, and East African troops. They were assisted by Somali forces led by Abdulahi Hassan with Somalis of the [[Isaaq]], [[Dhulbahante]], and [[Warsangali]] clans prominently participating. The number of [[Italian Somalis]] began to decline after World War II, with fewer than 10,000 remaining in 1960.<ref name="Tripodi1999" />

Following World War II, Britain retained control of both [[British Somaliland]] and Italian Somaliland as protectorates. In 1945, during the [[Potsdam Conference]], the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland as the [[Trust Territory of Somaliland]], on the condition—first proposed by the Somali Youth League (SYL) and other nascent Somali political organizations, such as Hizbia Digil Mirifle Somali (HDMS) and the Somali National League (SNL)—that Somalia achieve independence within ten years.<ref name="Zolberg">{{Harvnb|Zolberg|Suhrke|Aguayo|1989|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=B9_yS_ynvzgC&pg=PA106 106]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Kwame Anthony Appiah|author2=Henry Louis Gates|title=Africana: the encyclopedia of the African and African American experience: the concise desk reference|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cereWkyNJckC|date=26 November 2003|publisher=Running Press|isbn=978-0-7624-1642-4|page=1749}}</ref> British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960.<ref name="Tripodi1999">{{cite book |author=Paolo Tripodi|title=The Colonial Legacy in Somalia: Rome and Mogadishu: From Colonial Administration to Operation Restore Hope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJR3RAAACAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Macmillan Press|isbn=978-0-312-22393-9|page=68}}</ref>

To the extent that Italy held the territory by UN mandate, the trusteeship provisions gave the Somalis the opportunity to gain experience in Western political education and self-government. These were advantages that British Somaliland, which was to be incorporated into the new Somali state, did not have. Although in the 1950s British colonial officials attempted, through various administrative development efforts, to make up for past neglect, the protectorate stagnated. The disparity between the two territories in economic development and political experience would later cause serious difficulties integrating the two parts.<ref>Helen Chapin Metz, ed.

Britain included the conditional provision that the Somali residents would retain their autonomy, but Ethiopia immediately claimed sovereignty over the area.

A [[French Somaliland overseas territory referendum, 1958|referendum]] was held in neighbouring [[Djibouti]] (then known as [[French Somaliland]]) in 1958, on the eve of Somalia's independence in 1960, to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France. The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable [[Afar people|Afar]] ethnic group and resident Europeans.<ref name="Barrington2006" /> There was also widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls.<ref>Kevin Shillington (2005) ''Encyclopedia of African history'', CRC Press, p. 360, {{ISBN|1-57958-245-1}}.</ref>

The majority of those who voted 'no' were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council.

His assassination was quickly followed by a military [[coup d'état]] on 21 October 1969 (the day after his funeral), in which the [[Military of Somalia|Somali Army]] seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover. The putsch was spearheaded by Major General [[Siad Barre|Mohamed Siad Barre]], who at the time commanded the army.<ref>Moshe Y.

The revolutionary army established large-scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural [[literacy]] campaign, which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate. In addition to a nationalization program of industry and land, the new regime's foreign policy placed an emphasis on Somalia's traditional and religious links with the [[Arab world]], eventually joining the [[Arab League]] (AL) in 1974.<ref>Benjamin Frankel (1992) ''The Cold War, 1945–1991: Leaders and other important figures in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, China, and the Third World'', Gale Research, p. 306 {{ISBN|0-8103-8928-2}}.</ref> That same year, Barre also served as chairman of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), the predecessor of the [[African Union]] (AU).<ref>Oihe Yang (2000) ''Africa South of the Sahara 2001'', 30th ed., Taylor and Francis, p. 1025 {{ISBN|1-85743-078-6}}.</ref>

In July 1976, Barre's SRC disbanded itself and established in its place the [[Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party]] (SRSP), a one-party government based on [[scientific socialism]] and Islamic tenets. The SRSP was an attempt to reconcile the official state ideology with the official state religion by [[Revisionism (Marxism)|adapting Marxist precepts]] to local circumstances. Emphasis was placed on the Muslim principles of social progress, equality and justice, which the government argued formed the core of scientific socialism and its own accent on self-sufficiency, public participation and popular control, as well as direct ownership of the means of production. While the SRSP encouraged private investment on a limited scale, the administration's overall direction was essentially [[Communism|communist]].<ref name="Pjdlfw"/>

In July 1977, the [[Ogaden War]] broke out after Barre's government used a plea for national unity to justify an [[War of aggression|aggressive]] incorporation of the predominantly Somali-inhabited [[Ogaden]] region of Ethiopia into a Pan-Somali [[Greater Somalia]], along with the rich agricultural lands of south-eastern Ethiopia, infrastructure, and strategically important areas as far north as Djibouti.<ref>{{Harvnb|Tareke|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dRIfYPTZxJsC&pg=PA182 182–6]}}. The areas concerned amount to about a third of Ethiopia.</ref> In the first week of the conflict, Somali armed forces took southern and central Ogaden and for most of the war, the Somali army scored continuous victories on the Ethiopian army and followed them as far as [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]]. By September 1977, Somalia controlled 90% of the Ogaden and captured strategic cities such as [[Jijiga]] and put heavy pressure on [[Dire Dawa]], threatening the train route from the latter city to Djibouti. After the siege of Harar, a massive unprecedented Soviet intervention consisting of 20,000 [[Cuba]]n forces and several thousand Soviet experts came to the aid of Ethiopia's communist [[Derg]] regime. By 1978, the Somali troops were ultimately pushed out of the Ogaden. This shift in support by the Soviet Union motivated the Barre government to seek allies elsewhere. It eventually settled on the Soviets' [[Cold War]] arch-rival, the [[United States]], which had been courting the Somali government for some time. All in all, Somalia's initial friendship with the Soviet Union and later partnership with the United States enabled it to build the largest army in Africa.<ref name="Ramsbotham 222">{{cite book |author=Oliver Ramsbotham |author2=Tom Woodhouse |year=1999 |title=Encyclopedia of international peacekeeping operations |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=222 |isbn=0-87436-892-8}}</ref>
[[File:Abdulrahman Jama Barre.JPG|thumb|[[Abdulrahman Jama Barre]], former Foreign Minister, 1st Deputy Prime Minister, and Finance Minister of the Somali Democratic Republic.]]
A new constitution was promulgated in 1979 under which elections for a People's Assembly were held. However, Barre's Somali Revolutionary Socialist Party [[politburo]] continued to rule.<ref name="Grolierenc"/> In October 1980, the SRSP was disbanded, and the Supreme Revolutionary Council was re-established in its place.<ref name="Pjdlfw"/> By that time, Barre's government had become increasingly unpopular. Many Somalis had become disillusioned with life under military dictatorship.

The regime was weakened further in the 1980s as the Cold War drew to a close and Somalia's strategic importance was diminished. The government became increasingly [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], and [[resistance movement]]s, encouraged by Ethiopia, sprang up across the country, eventually leading to the [[Somali Civil War]]. Among the militia groups were the [[Somali Salvation Democratic Front]] (SSDF), [[United Somali Congress]] (USC), [[Somali National Movement]] (SNM) and the [[Somali Patriotic Movement]] (SPM), together with the non-violent political oppositions of the [[Somali Democratic Movement]] (SDM), the [[Factions in the Somali Civil War#Somali Democratic Alliance (SDA)|Somali Democratic Alliance]] (SDA) and the Somali Manifesto Group (SMG).

During 1990, in the capital city of Mogadishu, the residents were prohibited from gathering publicly in groups greater than three or four. Fuel shortages caused long lines of cars at petrol stations. Inflation had driven the price of pasta (ordinary dry Italian noodles, a staple at that time) to five U.S. dollars per kilogram. The price of [[khat]], imported daily from Kenya, was also five U.S. dollars per standard bunch. Paper currency notes were of such low value that several bundles were needed to pay for simple restaurant meals.

A thriving black market existed in the centre of the city as banks experienced shortages of local currency for exchange. At night, the city of Mogadishu lay in darkness. Close monitoring of all visiting foreigners was in effect. Harsh [[exchange control]] regulations were introduced to prevent export of foreign currency. Although no travel restrictions were placed on foreigners, photographing many locations was banned. During daytime in Mogadishu, the appearance of any government military force was extremely rare. Alleged late-night operations by government authorities, however, included "disappearances" of individuals from their homes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Focus on the Horn, Issues 7–9|year=1989|publisher=Horn of Africa Information Committee|page=37}}</ref>

===Somali Civil War===
{{Main|Somali Civil War|History of Somalia (1991–2006)}}
In 1991, the Barre administration was ousted by a coalition of clan-based opposition groups, backed by Ethiopia's then-ruling [[Derg]] regime and [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya|Libya]].<ref>Columbia University, School of International Affairs, ''Journal of international affairs'', Volume 40 (1986), p. 165.</ref> Following a meeting of the [[Somali National Movement]] and northern clans' elders, the northern former British portion of the country declared its independence as Somaliland in May 1991.

Many of the opposition groups subsequently began competing for influence in the power vacuum that followed the ouster of Barre's regime. In the south, armed factions led by USC commanders General [[Mohamed Farah Aidid]] and [[Ali Mahdi Mohamed]], in particular, clashed as each sought to exert authority over the capital.<ref>Library Information and Research Service, ''The Middle East: Abstracts and index'', Volume 2, (Library Information and Research Service: 1999), p.327.</ref> In 1991, a multi-phased international conference on Somalia was held in neighbouring Djibouti.

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 733|UN Security Council Resolution 733]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 746|UN Security Council Resolution 746]] led to the creation of [[United Nations Operation in Somalia I|UNOSOM I]], the first mission to provide humanitarian relief and help restore order in Somalia after the dissolution of its central government. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 794]] was unanimously passed on 3 December 1992, which approved a coalition of [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeepers]] led by the United States. Forming the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), the alliance was tasked with assuring security until humanitarian efforts aimed at stabilizing the situation were transferred to the UN.

The Transitional Federal Government (TFG) was the internationally recognised government of Somalia until 20 August 2012, when its tenure officially ended.<ref name="Fcacsunesinpshm"/> It was established as one of the [[Transitional Federal Institutions]] (TFIs) of government as defined in the [[Transitional Federal Charter]] (TFC) adopted in November 2004 by the [[Transitional Federal Parliament]] (TFP).

In 2006, the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU), an [[Islamism|Islamist]] organization, assumed control of much of the southern part of the country and promptly imposed [[Shari'a|Shari'a law]]. The Transitional Federal Government sought to reestablish its authority, and, with the assistance of [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|Ethiopian troops]], African Union peacekeepers and air support by the United States, managed to drive out the rival ICU and solidify its rule.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26334.html |title=Ethiopian Invasion of Somalia |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>

On 8 January 2007, as the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]] raged, TFG President and founder Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, a former colonel in the [[Somali Army]] and decorated war hero, entered Mogadishu with the Ethiopian military support for the first time since being elected to office.

Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]], regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured Baidoa but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html |title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 – The Commission's Watch List: Somalia |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005900/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher%2CUSCIRF%2C%2C%2C4a4f272bc%2C0.html |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Due to a lack of funding and human resources, an [[arms embargo]] that made it difficult to re-establish a national security force, and general indifference on the part of the international community, President Yusuf found himself obliged to deploy thousands of troops from Puntland to Mogadishu to sustain the battle against insurgent elements in the southern part of the country. Financial support for this effort was provided by the autonomous region's government. This left little revenue for Puntland's own security forces and civil service employees, leaving the territory vulnerable to piracy and terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Guide_to_Puntland_Election_2009_printer.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928150305/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Guide_to_Puntland_Election_2009_printer.shtml|archivedate=28 September 2013 |title=Somalia: Guide to Puntland Election 2009 |publisher=Garoweonline.com |date=25 December 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2005/ga10386.html |title=Opening Annual General Assembly Debate, Secretary-General Urges Member States to Press in Tackling Poverty, Terrorism, Human Rights Abuses, Conflicts |publisher=Unis.unvienna.org |accessdate=12 June 2011}}</ref>

On 29 December 2008, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed announced before a united parliament in Baidoa his resignation as President of Somalia. In his speech, which was broadcast on national radio, Yusuf expressed regret at failing to end the country's seventeen-year conflict as his government had been mandated to do.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7802622.stm "Somalia's president quits office"], [[BBC News]], 29 December 2008.</ref> He also blamed the international community for their failure to support the government, and said that the speaker of parliament would succeed him in office per the [[Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic|Charter of the Transitional Federal Government]].<ref>[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a790e984-d590-11dd-a9cc-000077b07658.html "Somali President Yusuf resigns"], Reuters (FT.com), 29 December 2008.</ref>

Between 31 May and 9 June 2008, representatives of Somalia's federal government and the moderate Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia (ARS) group of Islamist rebels participated in peace talks in Djibouti brokered by the former United Nations Special Envoy to Somalia, [[Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah]]. The conference ended with a signed agreement calling for the withdrawal of Ethiopian troops in exchange for the cessation of armed confrontation. Parliament was subsequently expanded to 550 seats to accommodate ARS members, which then elected [[Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed]], the former ARS chairman, to office. President Sharif shortly afterwards appointed [[Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], the son of slain former President [[Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke]], as the nation's new Prime Minister.<ref name="factbook"/>

With the help of a small team of African Union troops, the coalition government also began a [[War in Somalia (2009-)|counteroffensive]] in February 2009 to assume full control of the southern half of the country. To solidify its rule, the TFG formed an alliance with the Islamic Courts Union, other members of the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia, and [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]], a moderate [[Sufism|Sufi]] militia.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kamaal |url=http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/22/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928234017/http://horseedmedia.net/2010/05/22/un-boss-urges-support-for-somalia-ahead-of-istanbul-summit/ |archivedate=28 September 2013 |title=UN boss urges support for Somalia ahead of Istanbul summit |publisher=Horseedmedia.net |date=22 May 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> Furthermore, Al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam, the two main Islamist groups in opposition, began to fight amongst themselves in mid-2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8318798.stm |title=Islamists break Somali port truce |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=21 October 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>

As a truce, in March 2009, Somalia's coalition government announced that it would re-implement Shari'a as the nation's official judicial system.<ref>[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&section=0&article=119757&d=1&m=3&y=2009 Shariah in Somalia] – ''[[Arab News]]''</ref> However, conflict continued in the southern and central parts of the country. Within months, the coalition government had gone from holding about 70% of south-central Somalia's conflict zones, territory that it had inherited from the previous Yusuf administration, to losing control of over 80% of the disputed territory to the Islamist insurgents.<ref name="Gosppsdott"/>

During the coalition government's brief tenure and one year afterwards, due to the protracted lack of a permanent central authority, the [[Fund For Peace]]'s [[Fragile States Index]] (FSI; formerly known as the Failed States Index) listed Somalia on top for six consecutive years between 2008 and 2013.<ref name="Fsitf"/> In 2009, [[Transparency International]] ranked the nation in last place on its annual [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] (CPI), a metric that purports to show the prevalence of corruption in a country's public sector.<ref>{{cite web |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2009|url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table|publisher=Transparency International|accessdate=12 July 2010}}</ref> In mid-2010, the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]] also ranked Somalia in the next-to-last position in between war-afflicted Iraq and Afghanistan on its [[Global Peace Index]].

===Location===
[[File:Almadow Overview.JPG|thumb|The [[Cal Madow]] mountain range in northern Somalia features the nation's highest peak, [[Shimbiris]].]]
Somalia is bordered by Djibouti to the northwest, Kenya to the southwest, the [[Gulf of Aden]] to the north, the [[Guardafui Channel]] and Indian Ocean to the east, and Ethiopia to the west. It lies between latitudes [[2nd parallel south|2°S]] and [[12th parallel north|12°N]], and longitudes [[41st meridian east|41°]] and [[52nd meridian east|52°E]]. Strategically located at the mouth of the [[Bab el Mandeb]] gateway to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Suez Canal]], the country occupies the tip of a region that, due to its resemblance on the map to a [[rhinoceros]]' horn, is commonly referred to as the Horn of Africa.<ref name="factbook"/><ref name="Hadden">Hadden, Robert Lee. 2007.

[[File:Juba river downstream Jamaame.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Jubba River]]]]

===Habitat===
In the north, a scrub-covered, semi-desert plain referred as the ''[[Guban]]'' lies parallel to the Gulf of Aden [[littoral zone|littoral]]. With a width of twelve kilometres in the west to as little as two kilometres in the east, the plain is bisected by watercourses that are essentially beds of dry sand except during the rainy seasons. When the rains arrive, the Guban's low bushes and grass clumps transform into lush vegetation.<ref name="Hadden"/> This coastal strip is part of the [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] [[ecoregion]].
[[File:Laaglakeinnortheastrenprovince2016.jpg|thumb|Laag lake in the northeastern [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] province.]]
[[Cal Madow]] is a [[mountain range]] in the northeastern part of the country. Extending from several kilometres west of the city of [[Bosaso]] to the northwest of [[Erigavo]], it features Somalia's highest [[Summit (topography)|peak]], [[Shimbiris]], which sits at an elevation of about {{convert|2,416|m|ft}}.<ref name="factbook"/> The rugged east-west ranges of the Karkaar Mountains also lie to the interior of the Gulf of Aden littoral.<ref name="Hadden"/> In the central regions, the country's northern mountain ranges give way to shallow plateaus and typically dry watercourses that are referred to locally as the ''Ogo''. The Ogo's western plateau, in turn, gradually merges into the [[Haud]], an important grazing area for livestock.<ref name="Hadden"/>

Somalia has only two permanent rivers, the [[Jubba River|Jubba]] and [[Shebelle River|Shabele]], both of which begin in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. These rivers mainly flow southwards, with the Jubba River entering the Indian Ocean at [[Kismayo]]. The Shabele River at one time apparently used to enter the sea near [[Merca]], but now reaches a point just southwest of Mogadishu. After that, it consists of swamps and dry reaches before finally disappearing in the desert terrain east of [[Jilib]], near the Jubba River.<ref name="Hadden"/>

===Environment===
[[File:Somcoralreef.jpg|thumb|Somalia's [[coral reef]]s, ecological parks and protected areas]]
Somalia is a [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] country with about 1.64% [[arable land]].<ref name="factbook"/> The first local environmental organizations were Ecoterra Somalia and the Somali Ecological Society, both of which helped promote awareness about ecological concerns and mobilized environmental programs in all governmental sectors as well as in civil society. From 1971 onward, a massive tree-planting campaign on a nationwide scale was introduced by the Siad Barre government to halt the advance of thousands of acres of wind-driven [[sand dune]]s that threatened to engulf towns, roads and farm land.<ref>''National Geographic'', Vol. 159, National Geographic Society, 1981, p. 765.</ref> By 1988, 265 hectares of a projected 336 hectares had been treated, with 39 range reserve sites and 36 forestry plantation sites established.<ref name="Hadden"/> In 1986, the Wildlife Rescue, Research and Monitoring Centre was established by Ecoterra International, with the goal of sensitizing the public to ecological issues. This educational effort led in 1989 to the so-called "Somalia proposal" and a decision by the Somali government to adhere to the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), which established for the first time a worldwide ban on the trade of elephant [[ivory]].

In 1999, Horn Relief coordinated a peace march in the northeastern Puntland region of Somalia to put an end to the so-called "charcoal wars". As a result of Jibrell's lobbying and education efforts, the Puntland government in 2000 prohibited the exportation of charcoal.

Following the massive [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami of December 2004]], there have also emerged allegations that after the outbreak of the [[Somali Civil War]] in the late 1980s, Somalia's long, remote shoreline was used as a dump site for the disposal of toxic waste. The huge waves that battered northern Somalia after the tsunami are believed to have stirred up tons of nuclear and toxic waste that might have been dumped illegally in the country by foreign firms.<ref name="Toxic">{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article418665.ece |title=Somalia's secret dumps of toxic waste washed ashore by tsunami |work=The Times |date= 4 March 2005|accessdate=25 February 2009|location=London|author=Jonathan Clayton}}</ref>

The [[European Green Party]] followed up these revelations by presenting before the press and the [[European Parliament]] in [[Strasbourg]] copies of contracts signed by two European companies — the Italian Swiss firm, Achair Partners, and an Italian [[waste broker]], Progresso — and representatives of the then President of Somalia, the faction leader Ali Mahdi Mohamed, to accept 10 million tonnes of toxic waste in exchange for $80 million (then about £60 million).<ref name="Toxic"/>

According to reports by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), the waste has resulted in far higher than normal cases of respiratory infections, mouth ulcers and bleeding, abdominal haemorrhages and unusual skin infections among many inhabitants of the areas around the northeastern towns of [[Hobyo]] and [[Benadir]] on the Indian Ocean coast — diseases consistent with radiation sickness. UNEP adds that the current situation along the Somali coastline poses a very serious environmental hazard not only in Somalia, but also in the eastern Africa sub-region.<ref name="Toxic"/>

===Climate===
[[File:Horses3.jpg|thumb|[[Arabian horse]]s, referred to as ''faras'', seen here in the arid plains of [[Dhahar]]]]
Due to Somalia's proximity to the [[equator]], there is not much seasonal variation in its climate. Hot conditions prevail year-round along with periodic [[monsoon]] winds and irregular rainfall. Mean daily maximum temperatures range from {{convert|30|to|40|C|F}}, except at higher elevations along the eastern seaboard, where the effects of a cold offshore current can be felt. In Mogadishu, for instance, average afternoon highs range from {{convert|28|to|32|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in April. Some of the highest mean annual temperatures in the world have been recorded in the country; [[Berbera]] on the northwestern coast has an afternoon high that averages more than {{convert|38|°C|°F|abbr=on}} from June through September. Nationally, mean daily minimums usually vary from about {{convert|15|to|30|C|F}}.<ref name="Hadden"/> The greatest range in climate occurs in northern Somalia, where temperatures sometimes surpass {{convert|45|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in July on the littoral plains and drop below the freezing point during December in the highlands.<ref name="ClimateSom"/><ref name="Hadden"/> In this region, relative humidity ranges from about 40% in the mid-afternoon to 85% at night, changing somewhat according to the season.<ref name="Hadden"/>[[File:Somalia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Somalia map of Köppen climate classification.|alt=|left|420x420px]]Unlike the climates of most other countries at this latitude, conditions in Somalia range from arid in the northeastern and central regions to [[Semi-arid climate|semiarid]] in the northwest and south. In the northeast, annual rainfall is less than {{convert|4|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}}; in the central plateaus, it is about {{convert|8|to|12|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The northwestern and southwestern parts of the nation, however, receive considerably more rain, with an average of {{convert|20|to|24|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} falling per year. Although the coastal regions are hot and humid throughout the year, the hinterland is typically dry and hot.<ref name="Hadden"/>

There are four main seasons around which pastoral and agricultural life revolve, and these are dictated by shifts in the wind patterns. From December to March is the ''Jilal'', the harshest dry season of the year. The main rainy season, referred to as the ''Gu'', lasts from April to June. This period is characterized by the southwest monsoons, which rejuvenate the pasture land, especially the central plateau, and briefly transform the desert into lush vegetation. From July to September is the second dry season, the ''Xagaa'' (pronounced "Hagaa"). The ''Dayr'', which is the shortest rainy season, lasts from October to December.<ref name="Hadden"/> The ''tangambili'' periods that intervene between the two monsoons (October–November and March–May) are hot and humid.<ref name="Hadden"/>

=== Agriculture ===
{{See also|Agriculture in Somalia}}
Agriculture is the most important economic sector of Somalia. It accounts for about 65% of the GDP and employs 65% of the workforce.<ref name="Brcc" /> Livestock contributes about 40% to GDP and more than 50% of export earnings.<ref name="factbook" /> Other principal exports include [[fish]], [[charcoal]] and [[banana]]s; [[sugar]], [[sorghum]] and [[Maize|corn]] are products for the domestic market.<ref name="factbook" /> According to the Central Bank of Somalia, imports of goods total about $460 million per year, surpassing aggregate imports prior to the start of the civil war in 1991. Exports, which total about $270 million annually, have also surpassed pre-war aggregate export levels. Somalia has a trade deficit of about $190 million per year, but this is exceeded by remittances sent by Somalis in the diaspora, estimated to be about $1 billion.<ref name="Cbsef" />

With the advantage of being located near the Arabian Peninsula, Somali traders have increasingly begun to challenge [[Australia]]'s traditional dominance over the Gulf Arab livestock and meat market, offering quality animals at very low prices.

Prior to the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, the roughly 53 state-owned small, medium and large manufacturing firms were foundering, with the ensuing conflict destroying many of the remaining industries.

===Monetary and payment system===
{{Main|Central Bank of Somalia|Somali shilling}}
[[File:Somalia (Somaliland)(023).jpg|thumb|A [[Dahabshiil]] bank branch in Hargeisa.]]
The Central Bank of Somalia is the official [[Central bank|monetary authority]] of Somalia.<ref name="Cbsef"/> In terms of financial management, it is in the process of assuming the task of both formulating and implementing [[monetary policy]].<ref name="Monpol">{{cite web|url=http://www.somalbanca.org/monetary-policy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125062011/http://somalbanca.org/monetary-policy.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 January 2009|title=Central Bank of Somalia – Monetary policy|publisher=Somalbanca.org|accessdate=30 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Owing to a lack of confidence in the local currency, the [[United States dollar|US dollar]] is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. [[Dollarization]] notwithstanding, the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fuelled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. According to the Central Bank, this inflationary environment is expected to come to an end as soon as the bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.<ref name="Monpol"/>

Although Somalia has had no central monetary authority for more than 15 years between the outbreak of the civil war in 1991 and the subsequent re-establishment of the Central Bank of Somalia in 2009, the nation's payment system is fairly advanced primarily due to the widespread existence of private [[Economy of Somalia#Finance|money transfer operators]] (MTO) that have acted as informal banking networks.<ref name="Paysys">{{cite web|url=http://somalbanca.org/payment-system.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122232449/http://somalbanca.org/payment-system.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=22 January 2009|title=Central Bank of Somalia – Payment system|publisher=Somalbanca.org|accessdate=30 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

These remittance firms (''[[hawala]]s'') have become a large industry in Somalia, with an estimated US$1.6 billion annually remitted to the region by [[Somali people|Somalis]] in the diaspora via money transfer companies.<ref name="factbook"/> Most are members of the Somali Money Transfer Association (SOMTA), an umbrella organization that regulates the community's money transfer sector, or its predecessor, the Somali Financial Services Association (SFSA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diaspora-centre.org/DOCS/UK_Somali_Remittan.pdf |title=UK Somali Remittances Survey |format=PDF |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref><ref name="Towhamrec">{{cite news|url=http://www.threcorder.co.uk/content/towerhamlets/recorder/news/story.aspx?brand=REConline&category=newsTowerHam&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=newstower&itemid=WeED13%20Apr%202010%2010%3A02%3A08%3A730 |title=Decades of community service recognised with award |newspaper=Tower Hamlets Recorder |date=13 April 2007 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511205333/http://www.threcorder.co.uk/content/towerhamlets/recorder/news/story.aspx?brand=REConline&category=newsTowerHam&tBrand=northlondon24&tCategory=newstower&itemid=WeED13%20Apr%202010%2010%3A02%3A08%3A730 |archivedate=11 May 2011 }}</ref> The largest of the Somali MTOs is [[Dahabshiil]], a Somali-owned firm employing more than 2,000 people across 144 countries with branches in [[London]] and [[Dubai]].<ref name="Towhamrec"/>

As the reconstituted Central Bank of Somalia fully assumes its monetary policy responsibilities, some of the existing money transfer companies are expected in the near future to seek licenses so as to develop into full-fledged commercial banks. This will serve to expand the national payments system to include formal cheques, which in turn is expected to reinforce the efficacy of the use of monetary policy in domestic [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] management.<ref name="Paysys"/>

With a significant improvement in local security, Somali expatriates began returning to the country for investment opportunities. Coupled with modest foreign investment, the inflow of funds have helped the Somali shilling increase considerably in value. By March 2014, the currency had appreciated by almost 60% against the U.S. dollar over the previous 12 months. The Somali shilling was the strongest among the 175 global currencies traded by [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], rising close to 50 percentage points higher than the next most robust global currency over the same period.<ref>{{cite news |last=Derby|first=Ron|title=The curious tale of the world-beating Somali shilling|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/03/20/the-curious-tale-of-the-world-beating-somali-shilling/|accessdate=27 March 2014|newspaper=Financial Times|date=26 March 2014}}</ref>

A sizable Somali diaspora exists in various [[Western world|Western countries]], such as the [[United States]] (in particular in the state of [[Minnesota]]) and in the [[United Kingdom]] (particularly in [[London]]), [[Sweden]], [[Canada]], [[Norway]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Australia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], and [[Italy]], as well on the Arabian peninsula, and several African nations, such as [[Uganda]] and [[South Africa]]. The Somali diaspora is deeply involved in the politics and development of Somalia. The current president of Somalia, [[Farmaajo|Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed]], was a former diaspora Somali and still holds [[Citizenship of the United States|US citizenship]].

Somalia's population is expanding at a growth rate of 1.75% per annum and a birth rate of 40.87 births per 1,000 people.<ref name="factbook"/> The [[total fertility rate]] of Somalia is 6.08 children born per woman (2014 estimates), the fourth highest in the world, according to the [[CIA World Factbook]].<ref name="factbook"/> Most local residents are young, with a median age of 17.7 years; about 44% of the population is between the ages of 0–14 years, 52.4% is between the ages of 15–64 years, and only 2.3% is 65 years of age or older.<ref name="factbook"/> The [[Sex ratio|gender ratio]] is roughly balanced, with proportionally about as many men as women.<ref name="factbook"/>

There is little reliable statistical information on [[urbanization]] in Somalia. Rough estimates have been made indicating a rate of urbanization of 4.79% per annum (2005–2010 est.), with many towns quickly growing into cities.<ref name="factbook"/> Many ethnic minorities have also moved from rural areas to urban centres since the onset of the civil war, particularly to [[Mogadishu]] and [[Kismayo]].<ref>[http://www.persee.fr/articleAsPDF/ethio_0066-2127_2003_num_19_1_1051/article_ethio_0066-2127_2003_num_19_1_1051.pdf Bantu ethnic identities in Somalia]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Somalia}}
[[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are the official languages of Somalia.<ref name="Frspc" /> The Somali language is the mother tongue of the [[Somali people]], the nation's most populous ethnic group.<ref name="factbook" /> It is a member of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family, and its nearest relatives are the [[Oromo language|Oromo]], [[Afar language|Afar]] and [[Saho language|Saho]] languages.<ref>I. M. Lewis (1998) ''Peoples of the Horn of Africa: Somali, Afar and Saho'', Red Sea Press, p. 11, {{ISBN|1-56902-104-X}}.</ref> Somali is the best documented of the Cushitic languages,<ref>{{Harvnb|Lecarme|Maury|1987|p=22}}.</ref> with academic studies of it dating from before 1900.
[[File:Ciismaniya.jpg|thumb|The [[Osmanya alphabet|Osmanya]] writing script]]
Somali [[dialect]]s are divided into three main groups: Northern, Benadir and [[Maay language|Maay]]. Northern Somali (or Northern-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali. Benadir (also known as Coastal Somali) is spoken on the [[Benadir]] coast, from [[Adale]] to south of [[Merca]] including Mogadishu, as well as in the immediate hinterland. The coastal dialects have additional [[phoneme]]s that do not exist in Standard Somali. Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle ([[Rahanweyn]]) clans in the southern areas of Somalia.<ref>Andrew Dalby (1998) ''Dictionary of languages: the definitive reference to more than 400 languages'', Columbia University Press, p. 571, {{ISBN|0-7136-7841-0}}.</ref>

A number of [[writing system]]s have been used over the years for transcribing the Somali language. Of these, the [[Somali alphabet]] is the most widely used, and has been the official writing script in Somalia since the Supreme Revolutionary Council formally introduced it in October 1972.<ref>Economist Intelligence Unit (Great Britain) ''Middle East annual review'' (1975) p. 229</ref> The script was developed by the Somali [[Linguistics|linguist]] [[Shire Jama Ahmed]] specifically for the Somali language, and uses all letters of the English Latin alphabet except ''p'', ''v'' and ''z''. Besides Ahmed's Latin script, other orthographies that have been used for centuries for writing Somali include the long-established [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic script]] and [[Wadaad writing]]. Indigenous writing systems developed in the 20th century include the [[Osmanya alphabet|Osmanya]], [[Borama alphabet|Borama]] and [[Kaddare alphabet|Kaddare]] scripts, which were invented by [[Osman Yusuf Kenadid]], Sheikh [[Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur]] and [[Hussein Sheikh Ahmed Kaddare]], respectively.<ref>{{Harvnb|Laitin|1977|pp=86–7}}.</ref>

In addition to Somali, Arabic, which is also an Afro-Asiatic tongue,<ref name="Dubnov">Helena Dubnov (2003) ''A grammatical sketch of Somali'', Kِppe, pp. 70–71.</ref> is an official national language in Somalia.<ref name="Frspc"/> Many Somalis speak it due to centuries-old ties with the [[Arab world]], the far-reaching influence of the Arabic media, and religious education.<ref name="Dubnov"/><ref>Diana Briton Putman, Mohamood Cabdi Noor (1993) ''The Somalis: their history and culture'', Center for Applied Linguistics, p. 15.: "Somalis speak Somali. Many people also speak Arabic, and educated Somalis usually speak either English or Italian as well. Swahili may also be spoken in coastal areas near Kenya."</ref><ref>Fiona MacDonald et al. (2000) ''Peoples of Africa'', Vol. 10, Marshall Cavendish, p. 178.</ref>

[[English language|English]] is widely spoken and taught. It used to be a working language in the British Somaliland protectorate. [[Italian language|Italian]] was an official language in Italian Somaliland and during the trusteeship period, but its use significantly diminished following independence. It is now most frequently heard among older generations, government officials, and in educated circles.<ref name="Dubnov"/><ref>https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ita</ref> Other minority languages include [[Bravanese dialect|Bravanese]], a variant of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Swahili language]] that is spoken along the coast by the [[Bravanese people]], as well as [[Bajuni dialect|Kibajuni]], a Swahili dialect that is the mother tongue of the [[Bajuni people|Bajuni]] minority ethnic group.

According to the [[Pew Research Center]], 99.8% of Somalia's population is [[Muslim]].<ref name="Pew"/> The majority belong to the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch of [[Islam]] and the [[Shafi'i]] school of [[Islamic jurisprudence]].<ref name="Abdullahi 2001 1"/> [[Sufism]], the [[mysticism|mystical]] sect of Islam, is also well established, with many local ''jama'a'' (''[[Zaouia|zawiya]]'') or congregations of the various ''[[Tariqah|tariiqa]]'' or Sufi orders.<ref>I. M. Lewis (1998) ''Saints and Somalis: Popular Islam in a Clan-based Society'', The Red Sea Press, pp. 8–9, {{ISBN|1-56902-103-1}}.</ref> The constitution of Somalia likewise defines Islam as the state religion of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and Islamic [[sharia]] law as the basic source for national legislation.

Islam entered the region very early on, as a group of persecuted Muslims had sought refuge across the [[Red Sea]] in the Horn of Africa at the urging of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].<ref>Rafiq Zakaria (1991) ''Muhammad and The Quran,'' New Delhi: Penguin Books, pp. 403–4. {{ISBN|0-14-014423-4}}</ref> Islam may thus have been introduced into Somalia well before the faith even took root in its place of origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+so0014) |title=A Country Study: Somalia from The Library of Congress |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>

In addition, the Somali community has produced numerous important Islamic sheikhs and clerics over the centuries, many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Muslim learning and practice in the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and well beyond. Among these Islamic scholars is the 14th-century Somali [[theologian]] and [[jurist]] [[Uthman bin Ali Zayla'i]] of [[Zeila]], who wrote the single most authoritative text on the [[Hanafi]] school of Islam, consisting of four volumes known as the ''Tabayin al-Haqa'iq li Sharh Kanz al-Daqa'iq''.

[[Christianity]] is a minority religion in Somalia, with adherents representing less than 0.1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research Center.<ref name="Pew"/> There is one [[Catholicism|Catholic]] diocese for the whole country, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Mogadiscio|Diocese of Mogadishu]], which estimates that there were only about one hundred Catholic practitioners in 2004.<ref>{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dmgds|Diocese of Mogadiscio|23 January 2015}}</ref>

In 1913, during the early part of the colonial era, there were virtually no Christians in the Somali territories, with only about 100–200 followers coming from the schools and orphanages of the few Catholic missions in the [[British Somaliland]] [[protectorate]].<ref>Charles George Herbermann (1913) ''The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference on the Constitution, Doctrine, Discipline, and History of the Catholic Church'', Vol. 14, Robert Appleton Co., p. 139.</ref> There were also no known Catholic missions in Italian Somaliland during the same period.<ref>Charles Henry Robinson (2007) [1915], ''History of Christian Missions'', Read Books, p. 356.</ref> In the 1970s, during the reign of Somalia's then [[Marxism|Marxist]] government, church-run schools were closed and [[Missionary|missionaries]] sent home. There has been no [[archbishop]] in the country since 1989, and the [[Mogadishu Cathedral|cathedral]] in Mogadishu was severely damaged during the civil war. In December 2013, the Ministry of Justice and Religious Affairs also released a directive prohibiting the celebration of Christian festivities in the country.<ref>{{cite news |last=Khalif|first=Abdulkadir|title=Somalia bans Christmas celebrations|url=http://mobile.nation.co.ke/news/Somalia-bans-Christmas-celebrations/-/1950946/2125192/-/format/xhtml/-/774d8c/-/index.html|accessdate=3 January 2014|newspaper=Daily Nation|date=25 December 2013}}</ref>

According to the Pew Research Center, less than 0.1% of Somalia's population in 2010 were adherents of [[folk religion]]s.<ref name="Pew"/> These mainly consisted of some non-Somali ethnic minority groups in the southern parts of the country, who practice [[animism]].

===Health===
{{Main|Healthcare in Somalia}}
Until the collapse of the federal government in 1991, the organizational and administrative structure of Somalia's [[healthcare]] sector was overseen by the Ministry of Health. Regional medical officials enjoyed some authority, but healthcare was largely centralized. The [[Socialism|socialist]] government of former President of Somalia [[Siad Barre]] had put an end to private medical practice in 1972.<ref>Maxamed Siyaad Barre (1970) ''My country and my people: the collected speeches of Major-General Mohamed Siad Barre'', President, the Supreme Revolutionary Council, Somali Democratic Republic, Vol. 3, Ministry of Information and National Guidance, p. 141.</ref> Much of the national budget was devoted to military expenditure, leaving few resources for healthcare, among other services.<ref name="Petletbet">{{cite web |url=http://www.peterleeson.com/Better_Off_Stateless.pdf |title=Better Off Stateless: Somalia Before and After Government Collapse|format=PDF |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Somalia}}<!-- northwest; northeast and south-central below -->
Following the outbreak of the civil war in 1991, the task of running schools in Somalia was initially taken up by community education committees established in 94% of the local schools.<ref>{{cite web| author =Noel Ihebuzor| title =EC and UNICEF join hands to support education in Somalia| publisher =United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)| date = 31 January 2005| url =http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/RWB.NSF/db900SID/VBOL-696HBA?OpenDocument| accessdate = 9 February 2007}}</ref> Numerous problems had arisen with regard to access to education in rural areas and along gender lines, quality of educational provisions, responsiveness of school curricula, educational standards and controls, management and planning capacity, and financing. To address these concerns, educational policies are being developed that are aimed at guiding the scholastic process. In the autonomous Puntland region, the latter includes a gender sensitive national education policy compliant with world standards, such as those outlined in the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://education.puntlandgovt.com/education.php |title=Education |accessdate=2015-02-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929135728/http://education.puntlandgovt.com/education.php |archivedate=29 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.

The Ministry of Education is officially responsible for education in Somalia, and oversees the nation's [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]], [[Vocational education|technical and vocational]] schools, as well as primary and technical [[Teacher education|teacher training]] and [[Nonformal learning|non-formal education]]. About 15% of the government's budget is allocated toward scholastic instruction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wes.org/ca/wedb/somalia/soedov.htm |title=Somalia – Education Overview |publisher=Wes.org |date=6 May 2004 |accessdate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511075522/http://www.wes.org/ca/wedb/somalia/soedov.htm |archivedate=11 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The autonomous Puntland and Somaliland macro-regions maintain their own Ministries of Education.

In 2006, Puntland was the second territory in Somalia after Somaliland to introduce free primary schools, with teachers now receiving their salaries from the Puntland administration.<ref>{{cite web| title =Puntland (Somalia) to introduce free primary schools| publisher =Afrol News| url =http://www.afrol.com/articles/16083| date = 6 April 2006| accessdate = 9 February 2007}}</ref> From 2005/2006 to 2006/2007, there was a significant increase in the number of schools in Puntland, up 137 institutions from just one year prior.

The highest class enrollment was observed in the northernmost [[Bari, Somalia|Bari]] region, and the lowest was observed in the under-populated [[Ayn, Somalia|Ayn]] region. The distribution of classrooms was almost evenly split between urban and rural areas, with marginally more pupils attending and instructors teaching classes in urban areas.<ref name="Basic education survey"/>

Higher education in Somalia is now largely private. Several universities in the country, including [[Mogadishu University]], have been scored among the 100 best universities in Africa in spite of the harsh environment, which has been hailed as a triumph for [[grass-roots]] initiatives.<ref name="Somtroap"/> Other universities also offering higher education in the south include [[Benadir University]], the [[Somalia National University]], [[Kismayo University]] and the [[University of Gedo]]. In Puntland, higher education is provided by the [[Puntland State University]] and [[East Africa University]]. In Somaliland, it is provided by [[Amoud University]], the [[University of Hargeisa]], [[Somaliland University of Technology]] and [[Burao University]].

[[Madrasah|Qu'ranic schools]] (also known as ''dugsi quran'' or ''mal'aamad quran'') remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction in Somalia. They provide Islamic education for children, thereby filling a clear religious and social role in the country. Known as the most stable local, non-formal system of education providing basic religious and moral instruction, their strength rests on community support and their use of locally made and widely available teaching materials. The Qu'ranic system, which teaches the greatest number of students relative to other educational sub-sectors, is often the only system accessible to Somalis in nomadic as compared to urban areas. A study from 1993 found, among other things, that about 40% of pupils in Qur'anic schools were female. To address shortcomings in religious instruction, the Somali government on its own part also subsequently established the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs, under which Qur'anic education is now regulated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~ginie/somalia/pdf/koran.pdf |title=Koranic School Project|format=PDF |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Somalia}}

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Somali cuisine}}
[[File:Somali food.jpg|thumb|Various types of popular [[Somali cuisine|Somali dishes]]]]
The cuisine of Somalia, which varies from region to region, is a mixture of diverse culinary influences. It is the product of Somalia's rich tradition of trade and commerce. Despite the variety, there remains one thing that unites the various regional cuisines: all food is served [[halal]]. There are therefore no [[pork]] dishes, [[alcoholic beverages|alcohol]] is not served, nothing that died on its own is eaten, and no blood is incorporated. ''Qaddo'' or lunch is often elaborate.

Varieties of 'bariis' ([[rice]]), the most popular probably being [[basmati]], usually act as the main dish. Spices including [[cumin]], [[cardamom]], [[clove]]s, [[cinnamon]] and [[Salvia officinalis|garden sage]] are used to add aromas to these different rice dishes. Somalis serve dinner as late as 9 pm. During [[Ramadan (calendar month)|Ramadan]], the evening meal is often presented after [[Tarawih]] prayers; sometimes up to 11 pm.

'Xalwo' ([[halva]]) is a popular [[Confectionery|confection]] reserved for special festive occasions, such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions. It is made from [[corn starch]], sugar, cardamom powder, [[nutmeg]] powder and [[ghee]]. [[Peanut]]s are also sometimes added to enhance texture and flavour.<ref>Barlin Ali (2007) ''Somali Cuisine'', AuthorHouse, p. 79, {{ISBN|1-4259-7706-5}}.</ref> After meals, homes are traditionally perfumed using [[frankincense]] (''lubaan'') or [[incense]] (''cuunsi''), which is prepared inside an incense burner referred to as a ''[[dabqaad]]''.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Somalia}}
Somalia has a rich musical heritage centred on traditional Somali [[folklore]]. Most Somali songs are [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]]. That is, they only use five [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] per [[octave]] in contrast to a [[Heptatonic scale|heptatonic]] (seven note) scale like the [[major scale]]. At first listen, Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia, Sudan or the Arabian Peninsula, but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles. Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between [[lyricist]]s (''midho''), [[songwriter]]s (''laxan'') and [[Singing|singers]] (''codka'' or "voice").<ref>{{Harvnb|Abdullahi|2001|pp=170–1}}.</ref>

===Literature===
{{Main|Literature of Somalia}}

Somali scholars have for centuries produced many notable examples of [[Islamic literature]] ranging from poetry to [[Hadith]]. With the adoption of the [[Somali alphabet|Latin alphabet]] in 1972 as the nation's standard orthography, numerous contemporary Somali authors have also released novels, some of which have gone on to receive worldwide acclaim. Of these modern writers, [[Nuruddin Farah]] is the most celebrated. Books such as ''[[From a Crooked Rib]]'' and ''Links'' are considered important literary achievements, works that have earned Farah, among other accolades, the 1998 [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettre-ulysses-award.org/authors03/farah.html |title=Lettre Ulysses Award for the Art of Reportage – Nuruddin Farah |publisher=Lettre-ulysses-award.org |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref> [[Farah Mohamed Jama Awl|Faarax M.J. Cawl]] is another prominent Somali writer who is best known for his [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish era]] novel, ''Ignorance is the enemy of love''.

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Somalia. Important domestic competitions are the [[Somalia League]] and [[Somalia Cup]], with the [[Somalia national football team]] playing internationally.

[[Basketball]] is also played in the country. The [[FIBA Africa Championship 1981]] was hosted in Mogadishu from 15 to 23 December December 1981, during which the [[Somalia national basketball team|national basketball team]] received the bronze medal.<ref>{{cite web |title=1981 African Championship for Men|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/cid/AFMSM/sid/2399/_/1981_African_Championship_for_Men/index.html|publisher=FIBA|accessdate=15 December 2013}}</ref> The squad also takes part in the [[Basketball at the Pan Arab Games|basketball event]] at the [[Pan Arab Games]].

In 2013, a [[Somalia national bandy team]] was formed in [[Borlänge]]. It later participated in the [[Bandy World Championship 2014]] in [[Irkutsk]] and [[Shelekhov]] in [[Russia]].

In the [[martial arts]], [[Faisal Jeylani Aweys]] and [[Mohamed Deq Abdulle]] of the [[Somalia national taekwondo team|national taekwondo team]] took home a silver medal and fourth place, respectively, at the 2013 Open World [[Taekwondo]] Challenge Cup in [[Tongeren]].

===Architecture===
{{Main|Somali architecture}}
[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe]]]]
Somali architecture is a rich and diverse tradition of engineering and design involving multiple types of constructions and edifices, such as [[Stonemasonry|stone cities]], [[castle]]s, [[citadel]]s, [[Fortification|fortresses]], [[mosque]]s, [[mausoleum]]s, [[temple]]s, [[tower]]s, [[monument]]s, [[cairn]]s, [[megalith]]s, [[menhir]]s, [[dolmen]]s, [[tomb]]s, [[Tumulus|tumuli]], [[stele]]s, [[cistern]]s, [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] and [[lighthouse]]s. Spanning the country's ancient, medieval and early modern periods, it also embraces the fusion of Somalo-Islamic architecture with contemporary Western designs.

In ancient Somalia, [[pyramid]]ical structures known in Somali as ''taalo'' were a popular burial style, with hundreds of these [[dry stone]] monuments scattered around the country today. Houses were built of [[Ashlar|dressed stone]] similar to the ones in [[ancient Egypt]].<ref>John G. Jackson, J. Hampden Jackson (1972) ''Man, God and Civilization'', Citadel Press, p. 216, {{ISBN|0-8065-0858-2}}.</ref> There are also examples of courtyards and large stone walls enclosing settlements, such as the Wargaade Wall.

The adoption of Islam in Somalia's early medieval history brought [[Islamic architecture|Islamic architectural influences]] from [[Arabia]] and [[Persia]]. This stimulated a shift in construction from dry stone and other related materials to [[Coral rag|coral]] stone, [[Mudbrick|sun dried bricks]], and the widespread use of [[limestone]] in Somali architecture. Many of the new architectural designs, such as mosques, were built on the ruins of older structures, a practice that would continue over and over again throughout the following centuries.<ref>{{Harvnb|Abdullahi|2001|p=102}}.</ref>

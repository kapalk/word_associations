At the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]] in 1922, the boundaries of Kuwait and [[Najd]] were set; as a result of British interference, Kuwait had no representative at the [[Uqair Protocol of 1922|Uqair conference]]. Ibn Saud persuaded [[Percy Cox|Sir Percy Cox]] to give him two-thirds of Kuwait's territory. More than half of Kuwait was lost due to Uqair. After the Uqair conference, Kuwait was still subjected to a Saudi economic blockade and intermittent Saudi [[raid (military)|raiding]].

[url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/65693/1/39_MichaelHerb.pdf].</ref> unanimously approved a request for Kuwait’s reintegration with Iraq. A year later an armed uprising which had raised the integration banner as its objective was put down by the British.<ref>Batatu, Hanna 1978.

With the end of the world war, and increasing need for oil across the world, Kuwait experienced a period of prosperity driven by oil and its liberal atmosphere. The period of 1946-82 is often termed "the golden period of Kuwait" by western academics.<ref name=venezia>{{cite book |editor-first=Noura |editor-last=Al Sager |url={{google books|201yBgAAQBAJ|page=7|plainurl=yes}} |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait's Modern Era Between Memory and Forgetting|date=2014 |page=7 |publisher=National Council for Culture, Arts and Letters |isbn=9789990604238}}</ref><ref name=pavilion>{{Cite journal |editor-first=Farah |editor-last=Al-Nakib |url=https://www.academia.edu/8186917 |title=Kuwait's Modernity Between Memory and Forgetting |website=Academia.edu |date=2014 |page=7 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806191942/http://www.academia.edu/8186917/_Kuwaits_Modernity_Between_Memory_and_Forgetting_Introduction_to_Acquiring_Modernity_booklet_accompanying_the_Kuwait_Pavilion_at_La_Biennale_di_Venezias_14th_International_Architecture_Exhibition_ |archivedate=6 August 2017  |last1=Al-Nakib |first1=Farah }}</ref><ref name=farid>{{cite web |last=Farid |first=Alia |url=http://www.aliafarid.net/Art-Papers-Nov-Dec-2014 |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait at the 14th International Architecture Exhibition |website=aliafarid.net |date=2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030085747/http://www.aliafarid.net/Art-Papers-Nov-Dec-2014 |archivedate=30 October 2016  }}</ref> In popular discourse, the years between 1946 and 1982 are referred to as the "Golden Era".<ref name=venezia /><ref name=pavilion /><ref name=farid /><ref>{{cite journal |last=Gonzales |first=Desi |date=November–December 2014 |title=Acquiring Modernity: Kuwait at the 14th International Architecture Exhibition |url=http://www.artpapers.org/feature_articles/feature3_2014_1112.html |journal=[[Art Papers]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224135926/http://www.artpapers.org/feature_articles/feature3_2014_1112.html |archivedate=24 December 2014  |access-date=21 February 2015 }}</ref> However, Kuwaiti academics argue that this period was marked by benefits accruing only to the wealthier and connected ruling classes. It saw an increased presence of British, American and French citizens connected with the new oil industry, wealth transfer to people connected with the Emir, the creation of a new privileged upper class of educated Kuwaitis, bankers, and a vast majority of Kuwaitis living a life of penury. This resulted in a growing gulf between the wealthy minority and the majority of common citizens.<ref name="Farah" /> In 1950, a major public-work programme began to enable Kuwaitis to enjoy a modern standard of living. By 1952, the country became the largest oil exporter in the Persian Gulf region. This massive growth attracted many foreign workers, especially from Palestine, India, and Egypt – with the latter being particularly political within the context of the [[Arab Cold War]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|date=2 July 2016|title=Nasser's Educators and Agitators across al-Watan al-'Arabi: Tracing the Foreign Policy Importance of Egyptian Regional Migration, 1952–1967|journal=British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies|volume=43|issue=3|pages=324–341|doi=10.1080/13530194.2015.1102708|issn=1353-0194}}</ref> In June 1961, Kuwait became independent with the end of the [[Sheikhdom of Kuwait#History as a Protected State of Britain|British protectorate]] and the Sheikh [[Abdullah Al-Salim Al-Sabah]] became [[Emir of Kuwait]].

Kuwait has 15 satellite television channels, of which four are controlled by the Ministry of Information. State-owned [[Kuwait Television]] (KTV) offered first colored broadcast in 1974 and operates five television channels. Government-funded Radio Kuwait also offers daily informative programming in several foreign languages including [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Farsi]], [[Urdu]], and English on the [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[Shortwave|SW]].

The [[National Assembly (Kuwait)|National Assembly]] is the [[legislature]] and has oversight authority. The National Assembly consists of fifty elected members, who are chosen in elections held every four years. Since the parliament can conduct inquiries into government actions and pass motions of no confidence, [[checks and balances]] are robust in Kuwait.<ref name="btf">{{cite web|url=https://www.bti-project.org/fileadmin/files/BTI/Downloads/Reports/2010/pdf/BTI_2010_Kuwait.pdf|title=Kuwait Country Report|page=17|work=[[Bertelsmann Foundation]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116225654/https://www.bti-project.org/fileadmin/files/BTI/Downloads/Reports/2010/pdf/BTI_2010_Kuwait.pdf|archivedate=16 November 2016}}</ref> The parliament can be dissolved under a set of conditions based on constitutional provisions.<ref name=pogar /> The Constitutional Court and Emir both have the power to dissolve the parliament, although the Constitutional Court can invalidate the Emir's dissolution.

[[Executive power]] is executed by the government. The Emir appoints the prime minister, who in turn chooses the ministers comprising the government. According to the constitution, at least one minister has to be an elected MP from the parliament. The parliament is often rigorous in holding the [[government accountable]], government ministers are frequently interpellated and forced to resign.<ref name="pogar">{{cite web|url=ftp://pogar.org/LocalUser/pogarp/governance/nbrown/mechanisms.pdf|title=Mechanisms of accountability in Arab governance: The present and future of judiciaries and parliaments in the Arab world|author=Nathan J.

=== Military ===
The [[Military of Kuwait]] traces its original roots to the Kuwaiti cavalrymen and infantrymen that used to protect Kuwait and its wall since the early 1900s. These cavalrymen and infantrymen formed the defense and security forces in metropolitan areas; charged with protecting outposts outside the wall of Kuwait.

The Military of Kuwait consists of several joint defense forces. The governing bodies are the [[Ministry of Defense (Kuwait)|Kuwait Ministry of Defense]], the [[Ministry of Interior (Kuwait)|Kuwait Ministry of Interior]], the [[Kuwait National Guard]] and the Kuwait Fire Service Directorate. The [[Emir of Kuwait]] is the [[commander-in-chief]] of all defense forces by default. Even in the most adverse of all times such as a war, even the military is not allowed to make a single move without the Emir's consent.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

This last group, known as [[Kuwait Towers]], consists of three towers, two of which also serve as water towers.<ref>Kultermann 1981</ref> Water from the desalination facility is pumped up to the tower. The thirty-three towers have a standard capacity of 102,000 cubic meters of water.

Kuwait is a major source of foreign economic assistance to other states through the [[Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development]], an autonomous state institution created in 1961 on the pattern of international development agencies. In 1974, the fund's lending mandate was expanded to include all [[developing countries]] in the world.

In 2018 Kuwait enacted certain measures to regulate foreign labor. Citing security concerns, workers from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] will be subject to heightened scrutiny when applying for entry visas, and an outright ban was being imposed on the entry of domestic workers from [[Guinea-Bissau]] and [[Vietnam]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = Citing Security Concerns, Kuwait Bans Entry to These Nationalities| work = Al Bawaba| accessdate = 8 November 2018| date = 8 November 2018| url = https://www.albawaba.com/business/citing-security-concerns-kuwait-bans-entry-these-nationalities-1210600}}</ref> Workers from [[Bangladesh]] are also banned.<ref>{{Cite web| title = Kuwait Re-Activates Ban on Bangladeshi Workers| work = Al Bawaba| accessdate = 8 November 2018| date = 5 March 2018| url = https://www.albawaba.com/news/kuwait-re-activates-ban-bangladeshi-workers-1097934}}</ref>

===Petroleum===
{{main|Petroleum industry in Kuwait}}
Despite its relatively small territory, Kuwait has proven crude [[List of countries by proven oil reserves#Countries|oil reserves]] of 104&nbsp;billion barrels, estimated to be 10% of the world's reserves.

Kuwait has a large wealth-management industry that stands out in the region.<ref name=wages/> Kuwaiti investment companies administer more assets than those of any other GCC country, save the much larger Saudi Arabia.<ref name=wages/> The Kuwait Financial Centre, in a rough calculation, estimated that Kuwaiti firms accounted for over one-third of the total assets under management in the GCC.<ref name=wages/> The relative strength of Kuwait in the financial industry extends to its stock market.<ref name=wages/> For many years, the total valuation of [[List of companies of Kuwait|all companies]] listed on the [[Kuwait Stock Exchange]] far exceeded the value of those on any other GCC bourse, except Saudi Arabia.<ref name=wages/> In 2011, financial and banking companies made up more than half of the market capitalization of the Kuwaiti bourse; among all the Persian Gulf states, the market capitalization of Kuwaiti financial-sector firms was, in total, behind only that of Saudi Arabia.<ref name=wages/>

In recent years, Kuwaiti investment companies have invested large percentages of their assets abroad, and their foreign assets have become substantially larger than their domestic assets.<ref name=wages/>

===Transport===
{{Main|Transport in Kuwait}}
Kuwait has an extensive and modern network of highways. [[Roads in Kuwait|Roadways]] extended {{convert|5749|km|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|4887|km|0|abbr=on}} is paved. There are more than two million passenger cars, and 500,000 commercial taxis, buses, and trucks in use. On major highways the maximum speed is {{convert|120|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Since there is no railway system in the country, most people travel by automobiles.

[[File:Kuwait highway.jpg|thumb|A highway in Kuwait City]]
The country's public transportation network consists almost entirely of bus routes. The state owned Kuwait Public Transportation Company was established in 1962. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait as well as longer distance services to other [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]]. The main private bus company is CityBus, which operates about 20 routes across the country. Another private bus company, Kuwait Gulf Link Public Transport Services, was started in 2006. It runs local bus routes across Kuwait and longer distance services to neighbouring Arab countries.

There are two airports in Kuwait. [[Kuwait International Airport]] serves as the principal hub for international air travel. State-owned [[Kuwait Airways]] is the largest airline in the country. A portion of the airport complex is designated as Al Mubarak Air Base, which contains the headquarters of the [[Kuwait Air Force]], as well as the Kuwait Air Force Museum. In 2004, the first private airline of Kuwait, [[Jazeera Airways]], was launched. In 2005, the second private airline, [[Wataniya Airways]] was founded.

Kuwait has one of the largest shipping industries in the region. The Kuwait Ports Public Authority manages and operates ports across Kuwait. The country's principal commercial seaports are [[Shuwaikh]] and Shuaiba, which handled combined cargo of 753,334 TEU in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arabianbusiness.com/13916-kuwaits-ports-continue-to-break-records- |title=Kuwait's ports continue to break records – Transportation|work=ArabianBusiness.com|date=4 June 2007|accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref> Mina Al-Ahmadi, the largest port in the country, handles most of Kuwait's oil exports.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/mina-al-ahmadi.htm|title=Mina Al Ahmadi, Kuwait|work=Globalsecurity.org|accessdate=28 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150720012056/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/mina-al-ahmadi.htm|archivedate=20 July 2015}}</ref> Construction of another major port located in [[Bubiyan]] island started in 2007.

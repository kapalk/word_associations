The [[History of Denmark|unified kingdom of Denmark]] emerged in the 10th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the struggle for [[Dominium maris baltici|control of the Baltic Sea]].{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=31}} Denmark, Sweden, and Norway were ruled together under one sovereign ruler in the [[Kalmar Union]], established in 1397 and ending with [[Swedish War of Liberation|Swedish secession]] in 1523. The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, often referred to as the Dano-Norwegian Realm, or simply [[Denmark-Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[19th century in Denmark|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the 1864 [[Second Schleswig War]]. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]]. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Occupation of Denmark#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced [[Kanslergade Agreement|social and labour-market reforms]] in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present [[welfare state]] [[Nordic model|model]] with a highly developed [[mixed economy]].

The [[Constitution of Denmark]] was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the [[absolute monarchy]], which had begun in 1660. It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[capital city|capital]], [[list of cities in Denmark by population|largest city]], and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] influence in the [[Danish Realm]], [[devolution|devolving]] powers to handle internal affairs. [[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands
in 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[Greenlandic self-government referendum, 2008|further autonomy]] in 2009. Denmark became a member of the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union|EU]]) in 1973, but negotiated [[Opt-outs in the European Union|certain opt-outs]]; it retains its own currency, the [[Danish krone|krone]]. It is among the founding members of [[NATO]], the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and the [[United Nations]]; it is also part of the [[Schengen Area]].

Denmark is considered to be one of the most economically and socially developed countries in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/22/denmark-happiest-country_n_4070761.html|title=Denmark Is Considered The Happiest Country.

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Etymology of Denmark}}
The etymology of the word Denmark, and especially the relationship between Danes and Denmark and the unifying of Denmark as one kingdom, is a subject which attracts debate.<ref>Kristian Andersen Nyrup, Middelalderstudier [http://www.nyrups.dk/Historie/MiddelalderIndex.htm Bog IX. Kong Gorms Saga] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109141345/http://www.nyrups.dk/Historie/MiddelalderIndex.htm |date=9 January 2010 }}</ref><ref>''Indvandrerne i Danmarks historie'', Bent Østergaard, Syddansk Universitetsforlag 2007, {{ISBN|978-87-7674-204-1}}, pp. 19–24</ref> This is centered primarily on the prefix ''"Dan"'' and whether it refers to the [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Dani]] or a historical person [[Dan (king)|Dan]] and the exact meaning of the -''"mark"'' ending.

Most handbooks derive the first part of the word, and the name of the people, from a word meaning "flat land",<ref name="et1" /> related to German {{lang|de|Tenne}} "threshing floor", English ''den'' "cave".<ref name="et1">[[Jan de Vries (linguist)|J. de Vries]], ''Altnordisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', 1962, 73; [[:da:Niels Åge Nielsen|N. Å. Nielsen]], ''Dansk etymologisk ordbog'', 1989, 85–96.</ref> The ''-mark'' is believed to mean [[woodland]] or [[border]]land (see [[march (territory)|marches]]), with probable references to the border forests in south [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]].<ref>Navneforskning, Københavns Universitet{{cite web|url=http://navneforskning.ku.dk/stednavne.doc/betydninger.doc |title=Udvalgte stednavnes betydning |accessdate=27 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716144406/http://navneforskning.ku.dk/stednavne.doc/betydninger.doc |archivedate=16 July 2006 |df=dmy }}</ref>

The first recorded use of the word ''Danmark'' within Denmark itself is found on the two [[Jelling stones]], which are [[runestone]]s believed to have been erected by [[Gorm the Old]] ({{circa|955}}) and [[Harald Bluetooth]] ({{circa|965}}). The larger stone of the two is popularly cited as Denmark's "baptismal certificate" ({{lang|da|dåbsattest}}),<ref>{{cite book |last=O'Donoghue |first=Heather |title=Old Norse-Icelandic Literature: A Short Introduction |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lY-g2MTFh9gC&pg=PT27 |year=2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |location= |isbn=978-0-470-77683-4 |page=27}}</ref> though both use the word "Denmark", in the form of [[accusative case|accusative]] {{runic|ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚢᚱᚴ}} {{lang|non|tanmaurk}} ({{IPA|[danmɒrk]}}) on the large stone, and [[genitive case|genitive]] {{runic|ᛏᛅᚾᛘᛅᚱᚴᛅᚱ}} "tanmarkar" (pronounced {{IPA|[danmarkaɽ]}}) on the small stone.<ref>The [[dative case|dative]] form ''tąnmarku'' (pronounced {{IPA|[danmarkʊ]}}) is found on the contemporaneous Skivum stone.</ref> The inhabitants of Denmark are there called {{lang|da|tani}} ({{IPA|[danɪ]}}), or "Danes", in the accusative.

=== Prehistory ===

[[File:Solvognen DO-6865 2000.jpg|thumb|left|The gilded side of the [[Trundholm sun chariot]] dating from the Nordic Bronze Age]]
The earliest [[Archaeology of Denmark|archaeological findings in Denmark]] date back to the [[Eemian|Eem interglacial period]] from 130,000–110,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].<ref>Michaelsen (2002), p. 19.</ref> Denmark has been inhabited since around 12,500 BC and agriculture has been evident since 3900 BC.<ref name="foreign ministry">{{cite web|last=Nielsen|first=Poul Otto|date=May 2003|url=http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-1.asp|title=Denmark: History, Prehistory|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark]]|accessdate=1 May 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051122020555/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-1.asp |archivedate=22 November 2005}}</ref> The [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (1800–600 BC) in Denmark was marked by [[Tumulus|burial mounds]], which left an abundance of findings including [[lur]]s and the [[Trundholm sun chariot|Sun Chariot]].

During the [[Pre-Roman Iron Age]] (500 BC&nbsp;– AD 1), native groups began migrating south, and the first tribal [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] came to the country between the Pre-Roman and the [[Germanic Iron Age]],<ref>Busck and Poulsen (ed.) (2002), p. 20.</ref> in the [[Roman Iron Age]] (AD 1–400).<ref name="foreign ministry" /> The [[Roman province]]s maintained [[trade route]]s and relations with native tribes in Denmark, and [[Roman currency|Roman coins]] have been found in Denmark. Evidence of strong [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] cultural influence dates from this period in Denmark and much of North-West Europe and is among other things reflected in the finding of the [[Gundestrup cauldron]].

The tribal Danes came from the east [[List of islands of Denmark|Danish islands]] ([[Zealand]]) and [[Scania]] and spoke an early form of [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]]. Historians believe that before their arrival, most of [[Jutland]] and the nearest islands were settled by tribal [[Jutes]]. The Jutes migrated to [[Great Britain]] eventually, some as mercenaries of [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] King [[Vortigern]], and were granted the south-eastern territories of [[Kent]], the [[Isle of Wight]] and other areas, where they settled. They were later absorbed or [[ethnic cleansing|ethnically cleansed]] by the invading [[Angles]] and [[Saxons]], who formed the [[Anglo-Saxons]]. The remaining [[Jutes|Jutish]] population in Jutland assimilated in with the settling [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]].

A short note about the ''Dani'' in "[[Getica]]" by the historian [[Jordanes]] is believed to be an early mention of the Danes, one of the [[ethnic group]]s from whom modern [[Danes]] are descended.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jordanes |others=[[Charles C. Mierow]] (trans.) |date=22 April 1997|url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~vandersp/Courses/texts/jordgeti.html#III |title=The Origin and Deeds of the Goths, chapter III|accessdate=1 May 2006}}</ref><ref>Busck and Poulsen (ed.) (2002), p. 19.</ref> The [[Danevirke]] defence structures were built in phases from the 3rd century forward and the sheer size of the construction efforts in AD 737 are attributed to the emergence of a Danish king.<ref name="danevirke">Michaelsen (2002), pp. 122–23.</ref> A [[Younger Futhark|new runic alphabet]] was first used around the same time and [[Ribe]], the oldest town of Denmark, was founded about AD 700.

[[File:Ladbyskibet.jpg|thumb|The [[Ladby ship]], the largest ship burial found in Denmark]]
From the 8th to the 10th century the wider [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] region was the source of [[Vikings]]. They colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of Europe. The Danish Vikings were most active in the eastern and southern [[British Isles]] and [[Western Europe]]. They conquered and settled parts of [[England]] (known as the [[Danelaw]]) under King [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] in 1013, and [[France]] where Danes and Norwegians founded [[Normandy]] with [[Rollo]] as head of state. More [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] [[pence]] of this period have been found in Denmark than in England.<ref name="Lund">*{{cite web|last=Lund |first=Niels |date=May 2003 |url=http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-2.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510174200/http://www.um.dk/Publikationer/UM/English/Denmark/kap6/6-2.asp |archivedate=10 May 2006 |title=Denmark – History – The Viking Age |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Denmark)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark]] |accessdate=24 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>

[[File:Jellingsten stor 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Large stone containing a carved depiction of Jesus Christ|Larger of the two Jelling stones, raised by [[Harald Bluetooth]]]]
Denmark was largely consolidated by the late 8th century and its rulers are consistently referred to in [[Frankish language|Frankish]] sources as kings (''reges''). Under the reign of [[Gudfred]] in 804 the Danish kingdom may have included all the [[Lands of Denmark|lands]] of Jutland, [[Scania]] and the Danish islands, excluding Bornholm.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmFrVUb5DSwC&pg=PA76#v=onepage&q=danish%20kingdom%20king%20godfred|title=Christianization and the Rise of Christian Monarchy: Scandinavia, Central Europe and Rus' c.900–1200|first=Nora|last=Berend|date=22 November 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781139468367}}</ref>
The extant Danish monarchy traces its roots back to [[Gorm the Old]], who established his reign in the early 10th century.{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=31}} As attested by the [[Jelling stones]], the Danes were [[Christianised]] around 965 by [[Harald Bluetooth]], the son of [[Gorm the Old|Gorm]]. It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising [[Holy Roman Empire|Christian power]] in Europe, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case, Harald built six [[fortresses]] around Denmark called [[Viking ring fortress|Trelleborg]] and built a further [[Danevirke]]. In the early 11th century, [[Canute the Great]] won and united Denmark, England, and [[Norway]] for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.<ref name="Lund" />

Throughout the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], Denmark also included [[Skåneland]] (the areas of Scania, [[Halland]], and [[Blekinge]] in present-day south Sweden) and Danish kings ruled [[Danish Estonia]], as well as the [[duchy|duchies]] of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. Most of the latter two now form the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in northern Germany.

In 1397, Denmark entered into a [[personal union]] with [[Norway]] and [[Sweden–Finland|Sweden]], united under Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]].{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=33}} The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union. However, even from the start, Margaret may not have been so idealistic—treating Denmark as the clear "senior" partner of the union.<ref name="Lauring">Lauring, Palle (1960) ''A History of the Kingdom of Denmark'', Host & Son Co.: Copenhagen, p. 108.</ref> Thus, much of the next 125 years of [[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian history]] revolves around this union, with Sweden breaking off and being re-conquered repeatedly. The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as [[List of Swedish monarchs|Swedish King]] [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] conquered the city of [[Stockholm]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the [[Count's Feud]] civil war, [[Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein|Denmark converted]] to [[Lutheranism]] in 1536. Later that year, Denmark entered into a union with Norway.

After Sweden permanently [[Foundation of modern Sweden|broke away]] from the personal union, Denmark tried on several occasions to reassert control over its neighbour. King [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]] attacked Sweden in the 1611–1613 [[Kalmar War]] but failed to accomplish his main objective of forcing it to return to the union. The war led to no territorial changes, but Sweden was forced to pay a [[war reparations|war indemnity]] of 1 million [[silver]] [[riksdaler]] to Denmark, an amount known as the ''[[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Älvsborg ransom]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smb.nu/svenskakrig/1611.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011111014/http://smb.nu/svenskakrig/1611.asp |archivedate=11 October 2007 |title=Kalmarkriget 1611–1613 |accessdate=4 May 2007 |publisher=Svenskt Militärhistoriskt Bibliotek |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> King Christian used this money to found several towns and fortresses, most notably [[Glückstadt]] (founded as a rival to [[Hamburg]]) and [[Oslo|Christiania]]. Inspired by the [[Dutch East India Company]], he founded a similar [[Danish East India Company|Danish company]] and planned to claim [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] as a colony, but the company only managed to acquire [[Tharangambadi|Tranquebar]] on India's [[Coromandel Coast]]. Denmark's large colonial aspirations included a few key [[trading posts]] in [[Africa]] and [[India]]. While Denmark's trading posts in India were of little note, it played an important role in the highly lucrative [[Transatlantic Slave Trade|transatlantic slave trade]], through its trading outposts in [[Osu Castle|Fort Cristiansborg]] in [[Osu, Accra|Osu]], [[Ghana]] though which 1.5 million slaves were traded.<ref name="guardian6nov2018">{{cite news |last1=Rawlinson |first1=Kevin |title=Prince Charles says Britain's role in slave trade was an atrocity |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/05/prince-charles-says-britains-part-in-transatlantic-slave-trade-was-atrocity |accessdate=6 November 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=5 November 2018}}</ref> While the Danish colonial empire was sustained by trade with other major powers, and [[plantation]]s – ultimately a lack of resources led to its stagnation.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-first=James Stuart |editor1-last=Olson |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Shadle |year=1991 |title=Historical Dictionary of European Imperialism |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyqepNdgUWkC&pg=PA167|accessdate=15 May 2014|isbn=9780313262579 }}</ref>

In the [[Thirty Years' War]], Christian tried to become the leader of the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] states in Germany but suffered a crushing defeat at the [[Battle of Lutter]].<ref>Parker, pp. 69–70.</ref> The result was that the Catholic army under [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] was able to invade, occupy, and pillage Jutland, forcing Denmark [[Treaty of Lübeck|to withdraw from the war]].<ref>Parker, p. 70.</ref> Denmark managed to avoid territorial concessions, but King [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Adolphus]]' intervention in Germany was seen as a sign that the military power of Sweden was on the rise while Denmark's influence in the region was declining. In 1643, Swedish armies [[Torstenson War|invaded Jutland]] and claimed Scania in 1644.

[[File:Denmark-Norway in 1780.svg|thumb|Extent of the [[Denmark–Norway|Dano-Norwegian Realm]]. After the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden while Denmark kept the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]].]]
In the 1645 [[Second Treaty of Brömsebro (1645)|Treaty of Brømsebro]], Denmark surrendered Halland, [[Gotland]], the last parts of Danish Estonia, and several provinces in Norway. In 1657, King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]] declared war on Sweden and marched on [[Bremen-Verden]]. This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King [[Charles X Gustav]] of Sweden conquered both [[Jutland]], [[Funen]], and much of [[Zealand]] before signing the [[Treaty of Roskilde|Peace of Roskilde]] in February 1658, which gave Sweden control of Scania, [[Blekinge]], [[Trøndelag]], and the island of [[Bornholm]]. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having wrecked Denmark and in August 1658, he began a two-year-long siege of [[Copenhagen]] but failed to take the capital.{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=35}} In the following peace settlement, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Trøndelag and Bornholm.

Denmark tried to regain control of Scania in the [[Scanian War]] (1675–1679) but it ended in failure. After the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–21), Denmark managed to restore control of the parts of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]] ruled by the house of [[Holstein-Gottorp]] in the 1720 [[Treaty of Frederiksborg]] and the 1773 [[Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo]], respectively. Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the 18th century due to its [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral status]] allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Denmark traded with both [[First French Empire|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and joined the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Sweden, and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=League of Armed Neutrality|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100056830|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|1801]] and [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|1807]], in one case carrying off the [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish fleet]], in the other, burning large parts of the Danish capital. This led to the so-called Danish-British [[Gunboat War]]. British control of the waterways between Denmark and Norway proved disastrous to the union's economy and in 1813 Denmark–Norway went [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]].

The union was dissolved by the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814; the Danish monarchy "irrevocably and forever" renounced claims to the Kingdom of Norway in favour of the Swedish king.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jenssen-Tusch|first=Georg Friedrich|title=Zur Regierungsgeschichte Friedrich VI.

=== Constitutional monarchy (1849–present) ===
[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|left|The National Constitutional Assembly was convened by King [[Frederick VII of Denmark|Frederick VII]] in 1848 to adopt the [[Constitution of Denmark]].]]
A nascent Danish liberal and national movement gained momentum in the 1830s; after the European [[Revolutions of 1848]], Denmark peacefully became a [[constitutional monarchy]] on 5 June 1849. A new constitution established a [[Rigsdagen|two-chamber parliament]]. Denmark faced war against both [[Prussia]] and [[Habsburg Austria]] in what became known as the [[Second Schleswig War]], lasting from February to October 1864. Denmark was defeated and obliged to [[cession|cede]] [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig and Holstein]] to [[Prussia]]. This loss came as the latest in the long series of defeats and territorial loss that had begun in the 17th century. After these events, Denmark pursued a policy of neutrality in Europe.

[[Industrialization|Industrialisation]] came to Denmark in the second half of the 19th century.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tellier|first=Luc-Normand|title=Urban world history an economic and geographical perspective|date=2009|publisher=Presses de l'Université du Québec |location=Québec|isbn=9782760522091|page=457 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cXuCjDbxC1YC&pg=PA457}}</ref> The [[History of rail transport in Denmark|nation's first railways]] were constructed in the 1850s, and improved communications and overseas trade allowed industry to develop in spite of Denmark's lack of natural resources. [[Trade union]]s developed starting in the 1870s. There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.

Denmark maintained its neutral stance during [[World War I]]. After the defeat of Germany, the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles powers]] offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German [[irredentism]], Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a [[plebiscite]]; the two [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively. On 10 July 1920, Northern Schleswig was recovered by Denmark, thereby adding some 163,600 inhabitants and {{convert|3984|km2|sqmi}}.

In 1939 Denmark signed a 10-year non-aggression pact with [[Nazi Germany]] but [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|Germany invaded Denmark]] on 9 April 1940 and the Danish government quickly surrendered. [[Denmark in World War II|World War II in Denmark]] was characterised by economic co-operation with Germany until 1943, when the Danish government refused further co-operation and [[Royal Danish Navy|its navy]] [[Operation Safari|scuttled most of its ships]] and sent many of its officers to Sweden, which was neutral. The [[Danish resistance movement|Danish resistance]] performed a [[Rescue of the Danish Jews|rescue operation]] that managed to evacuate several thousand [[History of the Jews in Denmark|Jews]] and their families to safety in Sweden before the Germans could send them to death camps. Some Danes supported [[Nazism]] by joining the [[National Socialist Workers' Party of Denmark|Danish Nazi Party]] or volunteering to fight with Germany as part of the [[Frikorps Danmark]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rugg |first=Andy |title=Traitor Danes: most soldiers return heroes, but this lot came home total zeroes |url=http://cphpost.dk//culture/through-looking-glass/traitor-danes-most-soldiers-return-heroes-lot-came-home-total-zeroes |work=Copenhagen Post |accessdate=30 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130129130650/http://cphpost.dk/culture/through-looking-glass/traitor-danes-most-soldiers-return-heroes-lot-came-home-total-zeroes |archivedate=29 January 2013 }}</ref> Iceland severed ties to Denmark and [[Founding of the republic of Iceland|became an independent republic]] in 1944; [[Liberation of Denmark|Germany surrendered]] in May 1945; in 1948, the Faroe Islands gained [[home rule]]; in 1949, Denmark became a founding member of [[NATO]].

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|Denmark became a member of the European Union in 1973 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]
Denmark was a founding member of [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). During the 1960s, the EFTA countries were often referred to as the [[Outer Seven]], as opposed to the [[Inner Six]] of what was then the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC).<ref>{{cite news |title=Finland: Now, the Seven and a Half |work=Time |date=7 April 1961 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,874317,00.htm |accessdate=18 July 2009 }}</ref> In 1973, along with Britain and Ireland, Denmark joined the European Economic Community (now the [[European Union]]) after a [[Danish European Communities membership referendum, 1972|public referendum]]. The [[Maastricht Treaty]], which involved further European integration, [[Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum, 1992|was rejected]] by the Danish people in 1992; it was only accepted after a [[Danish Maastricht Treaty referendum, 1993|second referendum]] in 1993, which provided for [[Opt-outs in the European Union|four opt-outs]] from policies. The Danes rejected the euro as the national currency in [[Danish euro referendum, 2000|a referendum in 2000]]. Greenland gained home rule in 1979 and was awarded [[self-determination]] in 2009. Neither the [[Faroe Islands and the European Union|Faroe Islands]] nor [[Greenland–European Union relations#Outside the EU|Greenland]] are members of the European Union, the Faroese having declined membership of the EEC in 1973 and Greenland in 1986, in both cases because of fisheries policies.

Constitutional change in 1953 led to a [[unicameralism|single-chamber]] parliament elected by proportional representation, female accession to the Danish throne, and Greenland becoming an integral part of Denmark. The [[centre-left]] [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] led a string of coalition governments for most of the second half of the 20th century, introducing the [[Nordic model|Nordic welfare model]]. The [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] and the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party]] have also led [[centre-right]] governments. In recent years the [[right-wing populist]]<ref>{{cite book|author=David Arter|title=Democracy in Scandinavia: Consensual, Majoritarian Or Mixed?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLH4C0mUAC4C&pg=PA52|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-7047-1|page=52}}</ref> [[Danish People's Party]] has emerged as a major party—becoming the second-largest following the [[Danish general election, 2015|2015 general election]]—during which time immigration and integration have become major issues of public debate.

Land and water pollution are two of Denmark's most significant [[environmental issue]]s, although much of the country's household and industrial waste is now increasingly filtered and sometimes recycled. The country has historically taken a progressive stance on [[environmental preservation]]; in 1971 Denmark established a [[Ministry of Environment (Denmark)|Ministry of Environment]] and was the first country in the world to implement an [[environmental law]] in 1973.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=NHxwtVy9MKMC&pg=PA323 The law of environmental damage: liability and reparation].

Denmark has an outstanding performance in the global [[Environmental Performance Index]] (EPI) with an overall ranking of 4 out of 180 countries in 2016. This recent and significant increase in ranking and performance is mostly due to remarkable achievements in [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] and reductions in [[CO2 emission]] levels. A future implementation of [[air quality]] improvements are expected. The EPI was established in 2001 by the [[World Economic Forum]] as a global gauge to measure how well individual countries perform in implementing the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. The environmental areas where Denmark performs best (i.e. lowest ranking) are [[sanitation]] (12), [[water resource management]] (13) and health impacts of environmental issues (14), followed closely by the area of biodiversity and habitat. The latter are due to the many protection laws and protected areas of significance within the country even though the EPI is not considering how well these laws and regulations are affecting the current biodiversity and habitats in reality; one of many weaknesses in the EPI.<ref>Nor does the EPI gauge how well the biodiversity is faring compared to a pristine situation.</ref> Denmark performs worst (i.e. highest ranking) in the areas of environmental effects of fisheries (128)<ref>This is 128 out of only 136 countries, as only 136 countries are represented in this area of the EPI report.</ref> and forest management (96).

{{Danish regions|float=right}}
Denmark, with a total area of {{convert|43,094|km2|sqmi|lk=in|sigfig=5}}, is divided into five administrative regions ({{lang-da|regioner}}). The regions are further subdivided into [[List of municipalities of Denmark|98 municipalities]] (''{{lang|da|kommuner}}''). The easternmost land in Denmark, the [[Ertholmene]] archipelago, with an area of 39 hectares (0.16 sq mi), is neither part of a municipality nor a region but belongs to the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonas |last=Michael Kjær |title=Christiansø betaler ikke sundhedsbidrag |date=15 November 2006 |url=http://www.dr.dk/Regioner/Bornholm/Nyheder/Christiansoe/2006/11/15160130.htm |work=dr.dk |accessdate=12 August 2007 |language=da |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011075640/http://dr.dk/Regioner/Bornholm/Nyheder/Christiansoe/2006/11/15160130.htm |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The regions were created on 1 January 2007 to replace the 16 [[Counties of Denmark|former counties]]. At the same time, smaller municipalities were merged into larger units, reducing the number from 270. Most municipalities have a population of at least 20,000 to give them financial and professional sustainability, although a few exceptions were made to this rule.<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/Denmark.html Denmark: Regions, Municipalities, Cities & Major Urban Areas] – Statistics and Maps on ''City Population''.</ref> The administrative divisions are led by directly elected councils, elected proportionally every four years; the most recent [[Danish local elections, 2017|Danish local elections]] were held on 21 November 2017. Other regional structures use the municipal boundaries as a layout, including the [[Police of Denmark|police districts]], the [[courts of Denmark|court districts]] and the [[Ward (country subdivision)|electoral wards]].

=== Regions ===
The governing bodies of the regions are the [[local government|regional councils]], each with forty-one councillors elected for four-year terms. The councils are headed by regional district chairmen (''{{lang|da|regionsrådsformanden}}''), who are elected by the council.<ref name="brief">{{cite book|title=The Danish Regions – in Brief|date=2007|publisher=Danske Regioner|location=Copenhagen|isbn=978-87-7723-471-2|edition=3rd revised}}</ref>
The areas of responsibility for the regional councils are the [[health care in Denmark|national health service]], [[social services]] and [[regional development]].<ref name="brief" /><ref name=regioner>{{cite web|title=Regional Tasks in Denmark|url=http://www.regioner.dk/in+english/regional+denmark/regional+tasks|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140510023358/http://www.regioner.dk/in+english/regional+denmark/regional+tasks|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 May 2014|publisher=Danske Regioner|accessdate=23 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Unlike the counties they replaced, the regions are not allowed to levy taxes and the health service is partly financed by a national health care contribution until 2018 (''{{lang|da|sundhedsbidrag}}''), partly by funds from both government and municipalities.<ref name=taxation1>{{cite web|title=The Danish Tax System|url=http://ias.au.dk/taxation/the-danish-tax-system/|publisher=[[Aarhus University]]|accessdate=23 August 2015}}</ref> From 1 January 2019 this contribution will be abolished, as it is being replaced by higher income tax instead.

The [[area]] and populations of the regions vary widely; for example, the [[Capital Region of Denmark|Capital Region]], which encompasses the [[Copenhagen metropolitan area]] with the exception of the subtracted province East Zealand but includes the [[Baltic Sea]] island of [[Bornholm]], has a population three times larger than that of [[North Denmark Region]], which covers the more sparsely populated area of northern Jutland. Under the county system certain densely populated municipalities, such as [[Copenhagen Municipality]] and [[Frederiksberg Municipality|Frederiksberg]], had been given a status equivalent to that of counties, making them first-level administrative divisions. These ''[[sui generis]]'' municipalities were incorporated into the new regions under the 2007 reforms.

The Kingdom of Denmark is a [[unitary state]] that comprises, in addition to Denmark proper, two [[autonomous administrative division|autonomous]] constituent countries in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]]: [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]. They have been integrated parts of the Danish Realm since the 18th century; however, due to their separate historical and cultural identities, these parts of the Realm have extensive political powers and have assumed [[legislative]] and administrative responsibility in a substantial number of fields.<ref>[http://www.gfbv.it/3dossier/eu-min/autonomy.html The working autonomies in Europe] – Gesellschaft für bedrohte Völker (GFBV).

=== Government ===
{{Main|Folketing|Cabinet of Denmark}}

The Danish Parliament is unicameral and called the Folketing ({{lang-da|Folketinget}}). It is the [[legislature]] of the Kingdom of Denmark, passing [[Act of Parliament|acts]] that apply in Denmark and, variably, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The Folketing is also responsible for adopting the [[government budget|state's budgets]], approving the state's accounts, appointing and exercising control of the Government, and taking part in international co-operation. [[Bill (proposed law)|Bills]] may be initiated by the Government or by [[Member of parliament|members of parliament]]. All bills passed must be presented before the Council of State to receive [[Royal Assent]] within thirty days in order to become law.<ref>"A Bill passed by the Parliament shall become law if it receives the Royal Assent not later than thirty days after it was finally passed."

Danes elect 175 members to the Folketing, with Greenland and the Faroe Islands electing an additional two members each—179 members in total.<ref>{{harvnb|Jørgensen|1995|p=16.}}</ref> Parliamentary elections are held at least every four years, but it is within the powers of the Prime Minister to ask the Monarch to call for an election before the term has elapsed. On a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]], the Folketing may force a single minister or an entire government to resign.<ref>"A Minister shall not remain in office after the Parliament has passed a vote of no confidence in him." [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html The Constitution of Denmark – Section 15.]</ref>

The Government of Denmark operates as a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet government]], where executive authority is exercised—formally, on behalf of the Monarch—by Prime Minister and other [[cabinet minister]]s, who head [[List of Danish government ministries|ministries]]. As the executive branch, the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and internal policies of Denmark. The position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the [[confidence and supply|confidence]] of a majority in the Folketing; this is usually the current leader of the largest [[political party]] or, more effectively, through a [[political alliance|coalition of parties]]. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a cabinet on its own; Denmark has often been ruled by [[coalition governments]], themselves sometimes [[minority government]]s dependent on non-government parties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/din-mening/radikale-ved-historisk-skillevej|title=Radikale ved historisk skillevej|work=[[Berlingske Tidende]]|date=17 June 2007|accessdate=17 August 2007}}</ref>

Following a [[Danish general election, 2015|general election defeat]], in June 2015 [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], leader of the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (''{{lang|da|Socialdemokraterne}}''), resigned as Prime Minister. She was succeeded by [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]], the leader of the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal Party]] (''{{lang|da|Venstre}}''). Rasmussen became the leader of [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen II Cabinet|a cabinet]] that, unusually, consisted entirely of ministers from his own party. In the [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen III Cabinet|next cabinet]], created November 2016, there are several political parties represented.

{{Hatnote|Also related: [[Judiciary of Greenland]]}}
[[File:Supreme Court of Denmark (1697).jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]] presiding over the Supreme Court in 1697 ]]
Denmark has a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system with some references to [[Germanic law]]. Denmark resembles Norway and Sweden in never having developed a [[case-law]] like that of [[English law|England]] and the United States nor comprehensive [[Code (law)|codes]] like those of France and Germany. Much of its law is [[Custom (law)|customary]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Orfield|first1=Lester Bernhardt Orfield|title=The Growth of Scandinavian Law|date=2002|publisher=Lawbook Exchange|location=Union, N.J.|isbn=978-1-58477-180-7|page=14}}</ref>

The judicial system of Denmark is divided between courts with regular civil and [[criminal law|criminal]] jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Articles sixty-two and sixty-four of the Constitution ensure [[judicial independence]] from government and Parliament by providing that judges shall only be guided by the law, including acts, statutes and practice.<ref>"The administration of justice shall always remain independent of the executive power. Rules to this effect shall be laid down by Statute&nbsp;..." [http://www.servat.unibe.ch/icl/da00000_.html The Constitution of Denmark – Sections/Articles 62 and 64.]</ref> The Kingdom of Denmark does not have a single unified judicial system – Denmark has one system, Greenland another, and the Faroe Islands a third.<ref>{{harvnb|Gammelgaard|Sørensen|1998|p=18.}}</ref> However, decisions by the highest courts in Greenland and the Faroe Islands may be appealed to the Danish High Courts.

Denmark's [[armed forces]] are known as the [[Danish Defence]] ({{lang-da|Forsvaret}}). The Minister of Defence is [[commander-in-chief]] of the Danish Defence, and serves as chief [[diplomacy|diplomatic]] official abroad. During peacetime, the [[Ministry of Defence (Denmark)|Ministry of Defence]] employs around 33,000 in total.

Denmark is a long-time supporter of international [[peacekeeping]], but since the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999 and the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]] in 2001, Denmark has also found a new role as a warring nation, participating actively in several wars and invasions.

Denmark has a long tradition of scientific and technological invention and engagement, and has been involved internationally from the very start of the [[scientific revolution]]. In current times, Denmark is participating in many high-profile international science and technology projects, including [[CERN]], [[ITER]], [[ESA]], [[International Space Station|ISS]] and [[E-ELT]].

In the 20th century, Danes have also been innovative in several fields of the technology sector. Danish companies have been influential in the shipping industry with the design of the largest and most energy efficient container ships in the world, the [[Maersk Triple E class]], and Danish engineers have contributed to the design of [[MAN Diesel]] engines. In the software and electronic field, Denmark contributed to design and manufacturing of [[Nordic Mobile Telephone]]s, and the now-defunct Danish company [[DanCall]] was among the first to develop [[GSM]] mobile phones.

[[Life science]] is a key sector with extensive research and development activities. Danish engineers are world-leading in providing [[diabetes]] care equipment and medication products from Novo Nordisk and, since 2000, the Danish [[biotech]] company [[Novozymes]], the world market leader in enzymes for first generation starch based [[bioethanol]], has pioneered development of enzymes for converting waste to [[cellulosic ethanol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianbiomassmagazine.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&Itemid=132&id=3101|title=Novozymes, the world's leading provider of enzymes to the biofuels industry|publisher=Canadian Biomass Magazine |accessdate=7 October 2014}}</ref> ''[[Medicon Valley]]'', spanning the [[Øresund Region]] between Zealand and Sweden, is one of Europe's largest life science [[business cluster|clusters]], containing a large number of life science companies and research institutions located within a very small geographical area.

Private vehicles are increasingly used as a means of transport. Because of the [[car taxation|high registration tax]] (150%), [[VAT]] (25%), and one of the world's highest income tax rates, new cars are very expensive. The purpose of the tax is to discourage car ownership.
In 2007, an attempt was made by the government to favour environmentally friendly cars by slightly reducing taxes on high mileage vehicles. However, this has had little effect, and in 2008 Denmark experienced an increase in the import of fuel inefficient old cars,<ref>{{cite news |title=Tyske miljøzoner sender gamle biler til Danmark |date=9 January 2009 |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE626918/tyske-miljoezoner-sender-gamle-biler-til-danmark/ |work=Politiken.dk |accessdate=29 November 2010 |language=Danish}}</ref> as the cost for older cars—including taxes—keeps them within the budget of many Danes.

Denmark has a [[universal health care|universal]] [[health care system]], characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and, for most of the services, run directly by the regional authorities.

The astronomical discoveries of [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546–1601), [[Ludwig A. Colding]]'s (1815–88) neglected articulation of the principle of [[conservation of energy]], and the contributions to atomic physics of [[Niels Bohr]] (1885–1962) indicate the range of Danish scientific achievement. The fairy tales of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805–1875), the philosophical essays of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] (1813–55), the short stories of [[Karen Blixen]] (penname [[Isak Dinesen]]), (1885–1962), the plays of [[Ludvig Holberg]] (1684–1754), and the dense, aphoristic poetry of [[Piet Hein (scientist)|Piet Hein]] (1905–96), have earned international recognition, as have the symphonies of [[Carl Nielsen]] (1865–1931). From the mid-1990s, Danish films have attracted international attention, especially those associated with [[Dogme 95]] like those of [[Lars von Trier]].

A major feature of Danish culture is [[Jul (Denmark)|Jul]] (Danish [[Christmas]]). The holiday is celebrated throughout December, starting either at the beginning of Advent or on 1 December with a variety of traditions, culminating with the Christmas Eve meal.

Danish [[mass media]] date back to the 1540s, when handwritten fly sheets reported on the news. In 1666, [[Anders Bording]], the father of Danish journalism, began a [[state media|state paper]]. In 1834, the first liberal, factual newspaper appeared, and the 1849 Constitution established lasting [[freedom of the press in Denmark]]. Newspapers flourished in the second half of the 19th century, usually tied to one or another political party or trade union. Modernisation, bringing in new features and mechanical techniques, appeared after 1900. The total circulation was 500,000 daily in 1901, more than doubling to 1.2 million in 1925.<ref name="media1">Kenneth E. Olson, ''The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965'' (LSU Press, 1966) pp 50 – 64, 433</ref> The [[German occupation of Denmark|German occupation]] during World War II brought informal censorship; some offending newspaper buildings were simply blown up by the Nazis.

[[File:LarsVonTrier.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Director [[Lars von Trier]], who co-created the Dogme film movement]]

Danish cinema dates back to 1897 and since the 1980s has maintained a steady stream of product due largely to funding by the state-supported [[Danish Film Institute]]. There have been three big internationally important waves of Danish cinema: erotic melodrama of the [[silent film|silent era]]; the increasingly explicit sex films of the 1960s and 1970s; and lastly, the [[Dogme 95]] movement of the late 1990s, where directors often used hand-held cameras to dynamic effect in a conscious reaction against big-budget studios. Danish films have been noted for their realism, religious and moral themes, sexual frankness and technical innovation. The Danish filmmaker [[Carl Theodor Dreyer|Carl Th. Dreyer]] (1889–1968) is considered one of the greatest directors of [[early cinema]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Carl Dreyer:Day of Wrath, Ordet, Gertrud|url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/29/carldreyer.php|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160517210436/http://brightlightsfilm.com/29/carldreyer.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=17 May 2016|work=Bright Lights Film Journal|accessdate=1 July 2013|date=July 2000}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Robert|title=The Passion of Joan of Arc|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-the-passion-of-joan-of-arc-1928|work=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=1 July 2013|date=16 February 1997|quote=Carl Theodor Dreyer (1889–1968), the Dane who was one of the greatest early directors.}}</ref>

In the modern era, notable filmmakers in Denmark include [[Lars von Trier]], who co-created the Dogme movement, and multiple award-winners [[Susanne Bier]] and [[Nicolas Winding Refn]]. [[Mads Mikkelsen]] is a world-renowned Danish actor, having starred in films such as ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]'', ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', the Danish film ''[[The Hunt (2012 film)|The Hunt]]'', and the American TV series ''[[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]]''. Another renowned Danish actor [[Nikolaj Coster-Waldau]] is internationally known for playing the role of [[Jaime Lannister]] in the HBO series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.

Danish mass media and news programming are dominated by a few large corporations. In printed media [[JP/Politikens Hus]] and [[Berlingske Media]], between them, control the largest newspapers ''[[Politiken]]'', ''[[Berlingske Tidende]]'' and ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' and major tabloids ''[[B.T.

Denmark's architecture became firmly established in the [[Middle Ages]] when first [[Romanesque style|Romanesque]], then [[Gothic style|Gothic]] churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style.
During the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, both in the capital and the provinces. [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] ultimately merged into the 19th-century [[National Romantic style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title=Danish Architecture: An Overview |accessdate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130528/http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}, ''Visit Denmark''.

The 20th century brought along new architectural styles; including [[expressionist architecture|expressionism]], best exemplified by the designs of architect [[Peder Vilhelm Jensen-Klint]], which relied heavily on Scandinavian brick Gothic traditions; and [[Nordic Classicism]], which enjoyed brief popularity in the early decades of the century. It was in the 1960s that Danish architects such as [[Arne Jacobsen]] entered the world scene with their highly successful [[Danish Functionalist style|Functionalist architecture]]. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class masterpieces including [[Jørn Utzon]]'s [[Sydney Opera House]] and [[Johan Otto von Spreckelsen]]'s [[Grande Arche]] de la Défense in Paris, paving the way for a number of contemporary Danish designers such as [[Bjarke Ingels]] to be rewarded for excellence both at home and abroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ambhanoi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/Danish+Culture/Architecture/ |title=Architecture |accessdate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206051248/http://www.ambhanoi.um.dk/en/menu/InfoDenmark/Danish+Culture/Architecture/ |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy }}, Embassy of Denmark, Hanoi.

Danish design is a term often used to describe a style of [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalistic]] design and architecture that was developed in the mid-20th century, originating in Denmark. Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The [[Royal Copenhagen|Royal Porcelain Factory]] is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as [[Børge Mogensen]], [[Finn Juhl]], [[Hans Wegner]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and [[Verner Panton]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522002856/http://en.ddc.dk/denmarkbydesign "Danish by Design"], ''DDC''.

The first known Danish literature is myths and [[Danish folklore|folklore]] from the 10th and 11th century. [[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.

In the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nexø]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Turèll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter Høeg]].

Danish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[Søren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald Høffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S. Grundtvig|Grundtvig]], whose philosophy gave rise to a new form of non-aggressive nationalism in Denmark, and who is also influential for his theological and historical works.

While Danish art was influenced over the centuries by trends in Germany and the Netherlands, the 15th- and 16th-century [[church frescos in Denmark|church frescos]], which can be seen in many of the country's older churches, are of particular interest as they were painted in a style typical of native Danish painters.<ref>[http://www.panoramas.dk/kalkmalerier/ Wall Paintings in Danish Churches from Panoramas.dk].

The [[Danish Golden Age]], which began in the first half of the 19th century, was inspired by a new feeling of nationalism and romanticism, typified in the later previous century by [[History painting|history painter]] [[Nicolai Abildgaard]]. [[Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg]] was not only a productive artist in his own right but taught at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] where his students included notable painters such as [[Wilhelm Bendz]], [[Christen Købke]], [[Martinus Rørbye]], [[Constantin Hansen]], and [[Wilhelm Marstrand]].

In 1871, [[Holger Drachmann]] and [[Karl Madsen]] visited [[Skagen]] in the far north of [[Jutland]] where they quickly built up one of Scandinavia's most successful [[Skagen Painters|artists' colonies]] specialising in [[Naturalism (arts)|Naturalism]] and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] rather than in the traditional approach favoured by the Academy. Hosted by [[Michael Ancher|Michael]] and his wife [[Anna Ancher|Anna]], they were soon joined by [[P.S. Krøyer]], [[Carl Locher]] and [[Laurits Tuxen]]. All participated in painting the natural surroundings and local people.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/skagen Art Encyclopedia: Skagen.] Retrieved 9 December 2008.</ref> Similar trends developed on Funen with the ''[[Fynboerne]]'' who included [[Johannes Larsen]], [[Fritz Syberg]] and [[Peter Hansen (painter)|Peter Hansen]],<ref name=Funish>[http://www.johanneslarsenmuseet.dk/page.asp?sideid=2301&zcs=2200 "The Funish Art Colony"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418012953/http://www.johanneslarsenmuseet.dk/page.asp?sideid=2301&zcs=2200 |date=18 April 2013 }}, ''Johannes Larsen Museet''.

Painting has continued to be a prominent form of artistic expression in Danish culture, inspired by and also influencing major international trends in this area. These include [[impressionism]] and the modernist styles of [[expressionism]], [[abstract painting]] and [[surrealism]]. While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909–1912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948–51), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840–1920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt Sørensen]] (1899–1985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899–1986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907–1993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912–1993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913–2007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914–1973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bjørn Wiinblad]] (1918–2006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg Kærn (b. 1969, superrealism).

Danish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century. Today Danish photographers such as [[Astrid Kruse Jensen]] and [[Jacob Aue Sobol]] are active both at home and abroad, participating in key exhibitions around the world.<ref>[http://www.photography-now.com/popup_ausst_5.php?id_ausstellungen=T50624 Contemporary Danish Photography.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Danish cuisine}}
{{See also|Faroese cuisine|Greenlandic cuisine}}
[[File:Smørrebrød-01.jpg|thumb|left|''Smørrebrød'', a variety of Danish open sandwiches piled high with delicacies]]
The traditional [[cuisine]] of Denmark, like that of the other Nordic countries and of [[Northern Germany]], consists mainly of meat, fish and potatoes. Danish dishes are highly seasonal, stemming from the country's agricultural past, its geography, and its climate of long, cold winters.

The open sandwiches on rye bread, known as ''[[smørrebrød]]'', which in their basic form are the usual fare for lunch, can be considered a national speciality when prepared and decorated with a variety of fine ingredients. Hot meals traditionally consist of [[ground meat]]s, such as ''[[frikadeller]]'' (meat balls of veal and pork) and ''hakkebøf'' (minced beef patties), or of more substantial meat and fish dishes such as ''[[flæskesteg]]'' (roast pork with crackling) and ''kogt torsk'' (poached cod) with mustard sauce and trimmings. Denmark is known for its [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] and [[Tuborg]] beers and for its [[akvavit]] and [[bitters]].

Since around 1970, chefs and restaurants across Denmark have introduced [[gourmet]] cooking, largely influenced by [[French cuisine]]. Also inspired by continental practices, Danish chefs have recently developed a new innovative cuisine and a series of gourmet dishes based on high-quality local produce known as [[New Danish cuisine]].<ref>{{cite web|title=new nordic recipes|url=http://denmark.dk/en/lifestyle/food-drink/new-nordic-recipes|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref> As a result of these developments, Denmark now have a considerable number of internationally acclaimed restaurants of which several have been awarded [[Michelin Guide|Michelin stars]]. This includes [[Geranium (restaurant)|Geranium]] and [[Noma (restaurant)|Noma]] in Copenhagen.

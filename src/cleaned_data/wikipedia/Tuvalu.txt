In 1568, Spanish navigator [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] was the first European to sail through the archipelago, sighting the island of [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]] during his expedition in search of [[Terra Australis]]. The island of [[Funafuti]] was named Ellice's Island in 1819; the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English hydrographer [[Alexander George Findlay]]. The Ellice Islands came into Great Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century, as the result of a treaty between Great Britain and Germany relating to the demarcation of the spheres of influence in the Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Treaty_between_Great_Britain_and_Germany_relating_to_the_Demarcation_of_the_Spheres_of_Influence |title=Declaration between the Governments of Great Britain and the German Empire relating to the Demarcation of the British and German Spheres of Influence in the Western Pacific, signed at Berlin, April 6, 1886, |year=1886 |accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref> Each of the Ellice Islands was declared a [[British protectorates|British Protectorate]] by Captain Gibson of {{HMS|Curacoa|1878|6}} between 9 and 16 October 1892. The Ellice Islands were administered as a British protectorate by a [[Resident Commissioner]] from 1892 to 1916, as part of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]] (BWPT), and then as part of the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] colony from 1916 to 1976.

A [[Ellice Islands self-determination referendum, 1974|referendum was held in December 1974]] to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. As a consequence of the referendum, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony ceased to exist on 1 January 1976, and the separate British colonies of [[Kiribati]] and Tuvalu came into existence. Tuvalu became fully independent within the [[Commonwealth realm|Commonwealth]] on 1 October 1978. On 5 September 2000, Tuvalu became the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1290|189th member of the United Nations]].

{{see also|Timeline of the history of Tuvalu|Outline of Tuvalu}}

===Pre-history===
The [[History of the Polynesian people|origins of the people of Tuvalu]] are addressed in the theories regarding migration into the Pacific that began about 3000 years ago. During pre-European-contact times there was frequent canoe voyaging between the nearer islands including [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].<ref name=Howe>{{cite book |last=Howe |first=Kerry |title=The Quest for Origins |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin |location=New Zealand |isbn=0-14-301857-4 |pages=68, 70 }}</ref> Eight of the nine islands of Tuvalu were inhabited; thus the name, Tuvalu, means "eight standing together" in [[Tuvaluan language|Tuvaluan]] (compare to ''*walo'' meaning "eight" in [[Proto-Austronesian language#Numerals|Proto-Austronesian]]). Possible evidence of fire in the [[Caves of Nanumanga]] may indicate human occupation for thousands of years.

An important [[Tuvaluan mythology|creation myth of the islands of Tuvalu]] is the story of the ''te Pusi mo te Ali'' (the Eel and the Flounder) who created the [[islands of Tuvalu]];<ref name="JREF">{{cite web |last=Resture |first=Jane |title=Tuvalu Mythology: The Story of the Eel and the Flounder |date=June 2007 |url=http://www.janeresture.com/polynesia_myths/tuvalu.htm |accessdate=2 December 2012}}</ref> ''te Ali'' (the [[Bothidae|flounder]]) is believed to be the origin of the flat [[atoll]]s of Tuvalu and the ''te Pusin'' (the Eel) is the model for the [[coconut]] palms that are important in the lives of Tuvaluans. The stories as to the ancestors of the Tuvaluans vary from island to island.

Tuvalu was first sighted by Europeans on 16 January 1568, during the voyage of [[Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira|Álvaro de Mendaña]] from Spain, who sailed past [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]] and charted it as ''Isla de Jesús'' (Spanish for "Island of Jesus") because the previous day was the feast of the [[Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus|Holy Name]]. Mendaña made contact with the islanders but was unable to land.<ref>Maude, H.E. ''Spanish discoveries in the Central Pacific.

Captain [[John Byron]] passed through the islands of Tuvalu in 1764, during his circumnavigation of the globe as captain of the {{HMS|Dolphin|1751|3}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/circumnavigation.htm |title=Circumnavigation: Notable global maritime circumnavigations |publisher=Solarnavigator.net |accessdate=20 July 2009}}</ref> He charted the atolls as ''Lagoon Islands''. Keith S. Chambers and Doug Munro (1980) identified [[Niutao]] as the island that [[Francisco Antonio Mourelle|Francisco Mourelle de la Rúa]] sailed past on 5 May 1781, thus solving what Europeans had called ''The Mystery of Gran Cocal''.<ref name="KSDDM"/><ref name="Laumua Kofe 1983">Kofe, Laumua; Palagi and Pastors in ''Tuvalu: A History'', Ch. 15</ref> Mourelle's map and journal named the island ''El Gran Cocal'' ('The Great Coconut Plantation'); however, the latitude and longitude was uncertain.<ref name="Laumua Kofe 1983"/> Longitude could only be reckoned crudely at the time, as accurate [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]] only became available in the late 18th century.

[[Whaling|Whalers]] began roving the Pacific, although they visited Tuvalu only infrequently because of the difficulties of landing on the atolls. Captain George Barrett of the [[Nantucket]] whaler ''Independence II'' has been identified as the first whaler to hunt the waters around Tuvalu.<ref name="HEMaude86" /> He bartered coconuts from the people of [[Nukulaelae]] in November 1821, and also visited [[Niulakita]].<ref name="KSDDM"/> A shore camp was established on [[Sakalua]] islet of [[Nukufetau]], where coal was used to melt down the whale blubber.<ref name="TAH16">{{cite book |last1=Simati Faanin |first1=Hugh Laracy (ed.) |title=Tuvalu: A History |year=1983 |publisher=Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific and Government of Tuvalu |page=122 |chapter=Chapter 16 – Travellers and Workers}}</ref>

For less than a year between 1862 and 1863, Peruvian ships engaged in the so-called "[[blackbirding]]" trade combed the smaller islands of [[Polynesia]] from [[Easter Island]] in the eastern Pacific to Tuvalu and the southern atolls of the Gilbert Islands (now Kiribati), seeking recruits to fill the extreme labour shortage in Peru.<ref>Maude, H.E. (1981) ''Slavers in Paradise'', Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|0804711062}}.</ref> While some islanders were voluntary recruits, the "blackbirders" were notorious for enticing islanders on to ships with tricks, such as pretending to be Christian missionaries, as well as kidnapping islanders at gunpoint. The Rev. A. W. Murray,<ref>Murray A.W. (1876). ''Forty Years' Mission Work''. London Nisbet</ref> the earliest European missionary in Tuvalu, reported that in 1863 about 170 people were taken from Funafuti and about 250 were taken from Nukulaelae,<ref name="Laumua Kofe 1983"/> as there were fewer than 100 of the 300 recorded in 1861 as living on Nukulaelae.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Newton, W.F. |title=The Early Population of the Ellice Islands |volume=76 |issue=2 |year=1967 |journal=Journal of the Polynesian Society |pages=197–204}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Bedford, Richard |author2=Macdonald, Barrie |author3=Munro, Doug |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Population Estimates for Kiribati and Tuvalu |year=1980 |volume=89 |issue=1 |journal=Journal of the Polynesian Society |page=199}}</ref>

Christianity came to Tuvalu in 1861 when [[Elekana]], a deacon of a [[Congregational church]] in [[Manihiki]], [[Cook Islands]], became caught in a storm and drifted for eight weeks before landing at Nukulaelae on 10 May 1861.<ref name="Laumua Kofe 1983"/><ref name="MGDM">{{cite book |author1=Goldsmith, Michael |author2=Munro, Doug |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The accidental missionary: tales of Elekana |year=2002 |publisher=Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies, University of Canterbury |isbn=1877175331}}</ref> Elekana began [[proselytism|proselytising]] Christianity.

In the later 1890s and into first decade of the 20th century, structural changes occurred in the operation of the Pacific trading companies; they moved from a practice of having traders resident on each island to instead becoming a business operation where the [[supercargo]] (the cargo manager of a trading ship) would deal directly with the islanders when a ship visited an island. From 1900, the numbers of palagi traders in Tuvalu declined; the last of them were [[Fred Whibley]] on Niutao, [[Alfred Restieaux]] on Nukufetau,<ref>{{cite web |first=Jane |last=Resture |url=http://www.janeresture.com/r_to_r/alfred.html |title=From Restieaux to Resture |accessdate=4 November 2012}}</ref> and [[Christian Martin Kleis|Martin Kleis]] on Nui.<ref name="AM1909"/> By 1909 there were no more resident palagi traders representing the trading companies,<ref name="AM1909"/><ref name="Doug Munro 1987"/> although Whibley, Restieaux<ref name="ARMII">{{cite web |last=Resture |first=Jane |title=The Alfred Restieaux Manuscript Part II |url=http://www.janeresture.com/ar3.htm |accessdate=6 August 2011}}</ref> and Kleis<ref name="TPB12">{{cite web|first= |last= |title = Christian Martin Kleis|url= http://stampsoftuvalu.com/newsletter/2012-02.pdf|format= |edition= |series= |volume=|date=|year=2012 |month= |origyear= |publisher= TPB 02/2012 Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau  |accessdate=  19 November 2018}}</ref> remained in the islands until their deaths.

===Colonial administration===
{{Main|British Western Pacific Territories|Gilbert and Ellice Islands}}
The Ellice Islands were administered as a [[British protectorates|British Protectorate]] from 1892 to 1916, as part of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]] (BWPT), by a [[Resident Commissioner]] based in the Gilbert Islands. The administration of the BWTP ended in 1916, and the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] Colony was established, which existed until 1976.

=== Second World War ===
During the [[Pacific War]], Funafuti was used as a base to prepare for the subsequent seaborne attacks on the Gilbert Islands ([[Kiribati]]) that were occupied by Japanese forces.<ref name="PMcQ">{{cite book |last1=McQuarrie |first1=Peter |title=Strategic atolls: Tuvalu and the Second World War |year=1994 |publisher=Macmillan Brown Centre for Pacific Studies, University of Canterbury/ Institute of Pacific Studies, University of the South Pacific |isbn=0958330050}}</ref> The [[United States Marine Corps]] landed on Funafuti on 2 October 1942<ref name="pacificwrecks1">{{cite web |title=Tuvalu (Ellice Islands) |url=http://www.pacificwrecks.com/provinces/tuvalu.html |accessdate=1 June 2012}}</ref> and on Nanumea and Nukufetau in August 1943.

===Post-World War II – transition to independence===

==Government==
{{Main|Politics of Tuvalu}}
[[File:Government office building.jpg|thumb|Government office building]]

===Parliamentary democracy===
{{see also|Human rights in Tuvalu}}

The ''[[Constitution of Tuvalu]]'' states that it is "the supreme law of Tuvalu" and that "all other laws shall be interpreted and applied subject to this Constitution"; it sets out the [[Bill of rights|Principles of the Bill of Rights]] and the Protection of the Fundamental Rights and Freedoms.<ref name="pacliiC">{{cite web |work=The Constitution of Tuvalu |title=PACLII |url=http://www.paclii.org/tv/legis/consol_act/cot277/ |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref><ref name="TI">{{cite web |work=The Constitution of Tuvalu |title=Tuvalu Islands |url=http://www.tuvaluislands.com/const_tuvalu.htm |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>

Tuvalu is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and [[Commonwealth realm]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Tuvalu]]. Since the Queen resides in the United Kingdom, she is represented in Tuvalu by a [[Governor General of Tuvalu|Governor General]], whom she appoints upon the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Tuvalu]].<ref name="IPU81"/> In [[Tuvaluan constitutional referendum, 1986|1986]] and [[Tuvaluan constitutional referendum, 2008|2008]], referenda confirmed the monarchy.

From 1974 (the creation of the British colony of Tuvalu) until independence, the legislative body of Tuvalu was called the ''House of the Assembly'' or ''Fale I Fono''. Following independence in October 1978, the House of the Assembly was renamed the [[Parliament of Tuvalu]] or ''Palamene o Tuvalu''.<ref name="IPU81"/> The [[unicameral]] Parliament has 15 members, with elections held every four years. The members of parliament select the Prime Minister (who is the [[head of government]]) and the [[List of Speakers of the Parliament of Tuvalu|Speaker of Parliament]]. The ministers that form the [[Cabinet of Tuvalu|Cabinet]] are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister. There are no formal political parties; election campaigns are largely based on personal/family ties and reputations.

The [[Tuvalu National Library and Archives]] holds "vital documentation on the cultural, social and political heritage of Tuvalu", including surviving records from the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands|colonial]] administration, as well as Tuvalu government archives.<ref name="bl.uk">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070202161907/http://www.bl.uk/about/policies/endangeredarch/2006/rovery.html "Tuvalu National Archives major project"], British Library</ref>

===Legal system===
There are eight Island Courts and Lands Courts; appeals in relation to land disputes are made to the Lands Courts Appeal Panel. Appeals from the Island Courts and the Lands Courts Appeal Panel are made to the Magistrates Court, which has jurisdiction to hear civil cases involving up to [[Tuvaluan dollar|$T]]10,000. The superior court is the [[High Court of Tuvalu]] as it has unlimited original jurisdiction to determine the [[Law of Tuvalu]] and to hear appeals from the lower courts. Rulings of the High Court can be appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of Tuvalu]]. From the Court of Appeal, there is a right of appeal to Her Majesty in Council, i.e., the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in London.<ref name="SPL">{{cite book |author1=Corrin-Care, Jennifer |author2=Newton, Tess |author3=Paterson, Don |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Introduction to South Pacific Law |year=1999 |publisher=Cavendish Publishing Ltd |location=London}}</ref><ref name="PACLIIct">{{cite web |work=Tuvalu Courts System Information |title=PACLII |url=http://www.paclii.org/tv/courts.html |accessdate=10 March 2013}}</ref>

With regard to the judiciary, "the first female Island Court magistrate was appointed to the Island Court in Nanumea in the 1980s and another in Nukulaelae in the early 1990s." There were 7 female magistrates in the Island Courts of Tuvalu (as of 2007) in comparison "to the past where only one woman magistrate served in the Magistrate Court of Tuvalu."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pacwip.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Women-Place-Chapter-5-Tuvalu-2007.pdf |title=Advancing Women's Political Participation in Tuvalu: A Research Project Commissioned by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (PIFS) |last=Kofe |first=Susie Saitala |last2=Taomia |first2=Fakavae |year=2007 |website= }}</ref>

The [[Law of Tuvalu]] comprises the Acts voted into law by the Parliament of Tuvalu and statutory instruments that become law; certain Acts passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (during the time Tuvalu was either a British protectorate or British colony); the [[common law]]; and [[customary law]] (particularly in relation to the ownership of land).<ref name="SPL"/><ref name="PACLIIct"/> The land tenure system is largely based on ''kaitasi'' (extended family ownership).<ref name="TvAIP2">{{cite web |title=Pacific Aviation Investment Program (PAIP) Environmental Management Plan – Funafuti International Airport(FUN) and Road Interim Working Document |publisher= AECOM |date=13 November 2013 |url=http://tvaip.com//docstation/com_docstation/8/tuvalu_emp_final_draft_rev_f.pdf |accessdate=18 March 2016}}</ref>

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Tuvalu}}
Tuvalu participates in the work of [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community|the Pacific Community (SPC)]] and is a member of the [[Pacific Islands Forum]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the United Nations. It has maintained a mission at the United Nations in New York City since 2000. It is a member of the [[World Bank]] and the [[Asian Development Bank]].

Tuvalu maintains close relations with Fiji, New Zealand, Australia (which has maintained a [[High Commission]] in Tuvalu since 2018), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and the [[European Union]]. It has diplomatic relations with Taiwan; the country maintains one of the two foreign embassies in Tuvalu and has a large assistance programme in the islands.

A major international priority for Tuvalu in the UN, at the 2002 [[Earth Summit]] in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa and in other international fora, is promoting concern about global warming and the possible sea level rising. Tuvalu advocates ratification and implementation of the [[Kyoto Protocol]]. In December 2009, the islands stalled talks on climate change at the [[United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Copenhagen, fearing some other developing countries were not committing fully to binding deals on a reduction in carbon emissions. Their chief negotiator stated, "Tuvalu is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to climate change and our future rests on the outcome of this meeting."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8403745.stm|title=Developing countries split over climate measures|first=Richard|last=Black|work=BBC News|date=9 December 2009|accessdate=18 January 2010}}</ref>

Tuvalu participates in the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), which is a coalition of small island and low-lying coastal countries that have concerns about their vulnerability to the adverse effects of global climate change. Under the [[Majuro Declaration]], which was signed on 5 September 2013, Tuvalu has made a commitment to implement power generation of 100% renewable energy (between 2013 and 2020), which is proposed to be implemented using Solar PV (95% of demand) and biodiesel (5% of demand).

===Defence and law enforcement===
{{Main|Law enforcement in Tuvalu}}

Tuvalu has no regular military forces, and spends no money on the military. Its national police force, the ''[[Law enforcement in Tuvalu|Tuvalu Police Force]]'' headquartered in [[Funafuti]], includes a maritime [[surveillance]] unit, customs, prisons and immigration. Police officers wear [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom|British-style]] [[uniform]]s.

The police have a [[Pacific-class patrol boat]] (HMTSS ''Te Mataili'') provided by Australia in October 1994 under the Pacific Patrol Boat Programme for use in maritime surveillance and [[fishery]] patrol and for search-and-rescue missions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/GEO/tuvalu/tuvalu_brief.html |title=Tuvalu country brief |publisher=Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |accessdate=14 April 2010}}</ref> ("HMTSS" stands for ''His/Her Majesty's Tuvaluan State Ship'' or for ''His/Her Majesty's Tuvalu Surveillance Ship''.)

[[Crime in Tuvalu]] is not a significant social problem due to an effective criminal justice system, also due to the influence of the ''[[Falekaupule]]'' (the traditional assembly of elders of each island) and the central role of [[Religion in Tuvalu|religious institutions]] in the Tuvaluan community.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Islands of Tuvalu}}

Tuvalu consists of six [[atoll]]s and three [[reef]] islands. The smallest, Niulakita, is administered as part of Niutao.

Each island has its own high-chief, or ulu-aliki, and several sub-chiefs ([[aliki]]s). The community council is the ''[[Falekaupule]]'' (the traditional assembly of elders) or ''te sina o fenua'' (literally: "grey-hairs of the land"). In the past, another caste, the priests (tofuga), were also amongst the decision-makers. The ulu-aliki and aliki exercise informal authority at the local level. Ulu-aliki are always chosen based on ancestry. Under the Falekaupule Act (1997),<ref name="pacliiF">{{cite web |work=PACLII |title= Falekaupule Act (1997) |url=http://www.paclii.org/tv/legis/consol_act_2008/fa121/ |accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> the powers and functions of the ''Falekaupule'' are now shared with the ''pule o kaupule'' (elected village presidents; one on each atoll).<ref name="Bennetts">{{cite book |author1=Bennetts, Peter |author2=Wheeler, Tony |title=Time & Tide: The Islands of Tuvalu |year=2001 |isbn=1-86450-342-4 |publisher=Lonely Planet}}</ref>

* [[Funafuti]]
* [[Nanumea]]
* [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]]
* [[Nukufetau]]
* [[Nukulaelae]]
* [[Vaitupu]]
Local government districts consisting of only one island:
* [[Nanumanga]]
* [[Niulakita]]
* [[Niutao]]
Tuvalu has [[ISO 3166-2:TV|ISO 3166-2 codes]] defined for one town council (Funafuti) and seven island councils. Niulakita, which now has its own island council, is not listed, as it is administered as part of Niutao.

===Languages===
{{Main|Tuvaluan language}}
The [[Tuvaluan language]] and English are the national languages of Tuvalu. Tuvaluan is of the Ellicean group of [[Polynesian languages]], distantly related to all other Polynesian languages such as [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]], [[Māori language|Māori]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]], [[Samoan language|Samoan]] and [[Tongan language|Tongan]]. It is most closely related to the languages spoken on the [[Polynesian outlier]]s in Micronesia and northern and central [[Melanesia]]. The Tuvaluan language has borrowed from the Samoan language, as a consequence of Christian missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries being predominantly Samoan.<ref name="MD"/><ref name="Tuvaluan Te 'gana Tūvalu"/>

The [[Tuvaluan language]] is spoken by virtually everyone, while a language very similar to [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]] is spoken on [[Nui (atoll)|Nui]].<ref name="Tuvaluan Te 'gana Tūvalu">{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tuvaluan.htm|title= Tuvaluan (Te 'gana Tūvalu) |publisher=Omniglot |accessdate=6 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/country/TV/languages%7ctitle=Tuvalu%7cwork=Ethnologue |title=Tuvalu |work=Ethnologue}}</ref> English is also an official language but is not spoken in daily use.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Tuvalu}}
The [[cuisine of Tuvalu]] is based on the staple of [[coconut]] and the many species of fish found in the ocean and lagoons of the atolls. Desserts made on the islands include coconut and [[coconut milk]], instead of animal milk. The traditional foods eaten in Tuvalu are [[pulaka]], [[taro]], bananas, [[breadfruit]] and coconut.<ref name="CHC">[[#Hedley|Hedley]], pp. 60–63</ref> Tuvaluans also eat seafood, including [[coconut crab]] and fish from the lagoon and ocean. A traditional food source is seabirds (''taketake'' or [[black noddy]] and ''akiaki'' or [[white tern]]), with pork being eaten mostly at ''fateles'' (or parties with dancing to celebrate events).<ref name="Bennetts"/>

Pulaka is the main source for [[carbohydrate]]s. Seafood provides [[protein]]. Bananas and breadfruit are supplemental crops. Coconut is used for its juice, to make other beverages and to improve the taste of some dishes.<ref name="Bennetts"/>

A 1560-square-metre pond was built in 1996 on [[Vaitupu]] to sustain [[aquaculture in Tuvalu]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Fishery and Aquaculture Country Profile: Tuvalu |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization |url=http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/FI-CP_TV/en |accessdate=2 May 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326031726/http://www.fao.org/fishery/countrysector/FI-CP_TV/en |archivedate=26 March 2009}}</ref>

===Heritage===
The traditional community system still survives to a large extent on Tuvalu. Each family has its own task, or ''salanga'', to perform for the community, such as fishing, house building or defence. The skills of a family are passed on from parents to children.

Most islands have their own ''fusi'', community owned shops similar to convenience stores, where canned foods and bags of rice can be purchased. Goods are cheaper and fusis give better prices for their own produce.<ref name="Bennetts"/>

Another important building is the ''falekaupule'' or [[Maneaba|''maneapa'']] the traditional island meeting hall,<ref name=TKII>{{cite web |url=http://www.sprep.org/att/IRC/eCOPIES/Countries/Tuvalu/42.pdf |title=Te Kakeega II – National Strategies for Sustainable Development 2005–2015 |year=2005 |publisher=Government of Tuvalu |accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> where important matters are discussed and which is also used for wedding celebrations and community activities such as a ''fatele'' involving music, singing and dancing.<ref name="Bennetts"/> ''[[Falekaupule]]'' is also used as the name of the council of elders – the traditional decision making body on each island. Under the Falekaupule Act, ''Falekaupule'' means "traditional assembly in each island...composed in accordance with the Aganu of each island". ''Aganu'' means traditional customs and culture.<ref name=TKII/>

The main island of [[Funafuti]] is the focus of travellers, since the only airport in Tuvalu is the [[Funafuti International Airport]] and Funafuti is the only island that has hotel facilities.<ref>[http://www.timelesstuvalu.com/ Tuvalu's official tourism website]. Timelesstuvalu.com. Retrieved 14 July 2013.</ref> [[Ecotourism]] is a motivation of travellers to Tuvalu. The [[Funafuti Conservation Area]] consists of {{convert|12.74|sqmi|km2|2|abbr=off}} of ocean, reef, lagoon, channel and six uninhabited islets.

The outer atolls can be visited on the two passenger-cargo ships, ''Nivaga III'' and ''Manú Folau'', which provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks. There is guesthouse accommodation on many of the outer islands.

===Telecommunications and media===
{{Main|Telecommunications in Tuvalu}}
{{see also|List of newspapers in Tuvalu}}
The [[Tuvalu Media Corporation|Tuvalu Media Department]] of the Government of Tuvalu operates ''Radio Tuvalu'' which broadcasts from Funafuti.<ref name="pacmas">{{cite web |last=Jo Tacchi, Heather Horst, Evangelia Papoutsaki, Verena Thomas and Joys Eggins |work=Pacific Media Assistance Scheme (PACMAS) |title=State of Media & Communication Report – Tuvalu |date=6 October 2013 |url=http://www.pacmas.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06.-PACMAS_Tuvalu-Country-Report_FINAL.pdf |accessdate=5 January 2015}}</ref> In 2011, the Japanese government provided financial support to construct a new AM broadcast studio. The installation of upgraded transmission equipment allows Radio Tuvalu to be heard on all nine islands of Tuvalu. The new AM radio transmitter on Funafuti replaced the FM radio service to the outer islands and freed up satellite bandwidth for mobile services.<ref name="FTMN" /> ''Fenui – news from Tuvalu'' is a free digital publication of the Tuvalu Media Department that is emailed to subscribers and operates a Facebook page, which publishes news about government activities and news about Tuvaluan events.

The [[Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation]] (TTC), a state-owned enterprise, provides fixed line telephone communications to subscribers on each island, mobile phone services on [[Funafuti]], [[Vaitupu]] and [[Nukulaelae]] and is a distributor of the [[Fiji Television]] service ([[Sky Pacific]] satellite television service).<ref name="FTMN" />

[[Communications in Tuvalu]] rely on satellite dishes for telephone and internet access. The available bandwidth is only 512 kbit/s uplink, and 1.5 Mbit/s downlink. Throughout Tuvalu are more than 900 subscribers who want to use the satellite service, with demand slowing down the speed of the system.<ref name="elearn">{{cite journal |author1=Maui, Atufenua |author2=Kwato'o, Tony |author3=Vetter, Ronald |author4=Chisaki, Yoshifumi |author5=Usagawa, Tsuyoshi |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Preliminary Use of an E-learning Pilot System for Secondary Educational Institutions in Tuvalu: The Initial Implementation |date=June 2012 |journal=International Journal of e-Education, e-Business, e-Management and e-Learning |volume=2 |issue=3 |url=http://www.ijeeee.org/Papers/119-CZ02028.pdf}}</ref>

===Transport===
[[File:Manu Folau off Vaitupu Harbour, Tuvalu.JPG|thumb|right|''Manu Folau'' off [[Vaitupu]] atoll (2006)]]
Transport services in Tuvalu are limited. There are about {{convert|8|km|mi|0|spell=in|abbr=off}} of roads.<ref name=CIA/> The streets of Funafuti were paved in mid-2002, but other roads are unpaved. Tuvalu is among [[List of countries by rail transport network size|a few countries that do not have railroads]].

[[Funafuti]] is the only port, but there is a deep-water berth in the lagoon at [[Nukufetau]]. The [[merchant marine]] fleet consists of two passenger/cargo ships ''Nivaga III'' and ''Manu Folau''. The ''Nivaga III'' and ''Manu Folau'' provide round-trip visits to the outer islands every three or four weeks. and travel between [[Suva]], Fiji and Funafuti three or four times a year. The ''Manu Folau'', a 50-metre vessel, was a gift from Japan to the people of Tuvalu. In 2015, the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) assisted the government of Tuvalu to acquire ''MV Talamoana'', a 30-metre vessel that will be used to implement Tuvalu's [[National Adaptation Programme of Action]] (NAPA) to transport government officials and project personnel to the outer islands.<ref name="UNDP15">{{cite web |title=UNDP Supports Tuvalu Ship |work=Fiji Sun Online |date=15 January 2016 |url=http://fijisun.com.fj/2016/01/15/undp-supports-tuvalu-ship/ |accessdate=15 January 2016}}</ref> In 2015, the ''Nivaga III'' was donated by the government of Japan; it replaced the ''Nivaga II'', which had serviced Tuvalu from 1989.<ref name="FSO0316">{{cite web |last=Moceituba |first=Atasa |title=Brand-new vessel for Tuvalu |work=The Fiji Times |date=3 February 2016 |url=http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=340189 |accessdate=17 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324094852/http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=340189 |archivedate=24 March 2016 |dead-url=yes }}</ref><ref name="PN0507">{{cite web |title=Kiribati private business buys Tuvalu's Nivaga II to operate in Kiribati |work=RADIO KIRIBATI/PACNEWS |date=25 May 2017 |url=http://www.pina.com.fj/index.php?p=pacnews&m=read&o=93141604659265acd9a8aa537778fa |accessdate=25 May 2017}}</ref>

Tuvalu experiences the effects of [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]], which is caused by changes in ocean temperatures in the equatorial and central Pacific. El Niño effects increase the chances of tropical storms and [[cyclones]], while La Niña effects increase the chances of drought. Typically the islands of Tuvalu receive between {{convert|200|to|400|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall per month. However, in 2011, a weak La Niña effect caused a drought by cooling the surface of the sea around Tuvalu.

The eastern shoreline of Funafuti Lagoon  on [[Fongafale]] was modified during World War II when the airfield (now [[Funafuti International Airport]]) was constructed. The coral base of the atoll was used as fill to create the runway. The resulting [[borrow pit]]s impacted the fresh-water [[aquifer]].

=== Water and sanitation ===
Rainwater harvesting is the principal source of fresh water in Tuvalu. Nukufetau, Vaitupu and Nanumea are the only islands with sustainable groundwater supplies. The effectiveness of rainwater harvesting is diminished because of poor maintenance of roofs, gutters and pipes.<ref name="FTMN"/><ref>Kingston, P A (2004).

Reverse osmosis (R/O) desalination units supplement rainwater harvesting on Funafuti. The 65 m<sup>3</sup> desalination plant operates at a real production level of around 40 m<sup>3</sup> per day. R/O water is only intended to be produced when storage falls below 30%, however demand to replenish household storage supplies with tanker-delivered water means that the R/O desalination units are continually operating. Water is delivered at a cost of A$3.50 per m<sup>3</sup>. Cost of production and delivery has been estimated at A$6 per m<sup>3</sup>, with the difference subsidised by the government.<ref name="FTMN"/>

In July 2012, a United Nations Special Rapporteur called on the Tuvalu Government to develop a national water strategy to improve access to safe drinking water and sanitation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pacific.scoop.co.nz/2012/07/un-human-right-to-safe-drinking-water-mission-to-tuvalu/ |title=Mission to Tuvalu – Press Statement United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation |date=19 July 2012 |publisher=Ms. Catarina de Albuquerque, United Nations Special Rapporteur |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-07-20/an-tuvalu-water-and-sanitation/4143036 |title=Tuvalu urged to develop national water strategy |date=19 July 2012 |publisher=Australian Network News |accessdate=15 August 2012}}</ref> In 2012, Tuvalu developed a National Water Resources Policy under the Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) Project and the Pacific Adaptation to Climate Change (PACC) Project, which are sponsored by the Global Environment Fund/SOPAC.

Tuvalu is working with the [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) to implement composting toilets and to improve the treatment of sewage sludge from septic tanks on [[Fongafale]], for septic tanks are leaking into the [[Lens (hydrology)|freshwater lens]] in the sub-surface of the atoll as well as the ocean and lagoon. Composting toilets reduce water use by up to 30%.<ref name="FTMN"/>

* Annual and seasonal mean rainfalls are projected to increase (high confidence).<ref name="CCP2ch15"/>

* The intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall days are projected to increase (high confidence).<ref name="CCP2ch15"/>
* The incidence of drought is projected to decrease (moderate confidence).<ref name="CCP2ch15"/>
* Tropical cyclone numbers are projected to decline in the south-east Pacific Ocean basin (0–40ºS, 170ºE–130ºW) (moderate confidence).<ref name="CCP2ch15"/>
* Ocean acidification is projected to continue (very high confidence).<ref name="CCP2ch15"/>
* Mean sea-level rise is projected to continue (very high confidence).<ref name="CCP2ch15"/>

The [[South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission]] (SOPAC) suggests that, while Tuvalu is vulnerable to climate change, environmental problems such as population growth and poor coastal management also affect sustainable development. SOPAC ranks the country as extremely vulnerable using the [[Environmental Vulnerability Index]].

===2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21)===
Prime Minister [[Enele Sopoaga]] said at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP21) that the goal for COP21 should be a global temperature goal of below 1.5 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels, which is the position of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]].<ref name=ASI>{{cite news |last=Sims |first=Alexandra |title=Pacific Island Tuvalu calls for 1.5 degrees global warming limit or faces 'total demise' |work=The Independent |date=2 December 2015 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/pacific-island-tuvalu-calls-for-15-degrees-global-warming-limit-or-face-total-demise-a6756941.html |accessdate=5 December 2015}}</ref>
Prime Minister Sopoaga said in his speech to the meeting of heads of state and government:
{{quote|Tuvalu's future at current warming, is already bleak, any further temperature increase will spell the total demise of Tuvalu&nbsp;... For Small Island Developing States, Least Developed Countries and many others, setting a global temperature goal of below 1.5 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels is critical.

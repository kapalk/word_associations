'''Canada''' ({{IPA-all|kanadɑ|Canadian French:}}) is a country in the northern part of [[North America]]. Its [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]] extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering {{convert|9.98|e6km2|e6sqmi|2|abbr=off}}, making it the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-largest country by total area]]. Canada's southern [[Canada–United States border|border with the United States]] is the world's longest bi-national land border. Its capital is [[Ottawa]], and its three [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|largest metropolitan areas]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], and [[Vancouver]]. As a whole, Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land area being dominated by forest and tundra. Consequently, its population is highly [[Urbanization|urbanized]], with over 80 percent of its inhabitants concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, many near the southern border. [[Temperature in Canada|Canada's climate]] varies widely across its vast area, ranging from [[Climate of the Arctic|arctic weather]] in the north, to hot summers in the southern regions, with four distinct seasons.

Various [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|indigenous peoples]] have inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years prior to European colonization. Beginning in the 16th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored, and later settled, along the Atlantic coast.  As a consequence of [[Military history of Canada|various armed conflicts]], France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[British Dominions|dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] of 1931 and culminated in the [[Canada Act 1982|Canada Act]] of 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[British parliament]].

Canada is a [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Queen of Canada|its queen]] and an elected [[Prime Minister of Canada|prime minister]] who serves as the chairman of the [[Cabinet of Canada|federal cabinet]] and [[Government of Canada|head of government]]. The country is a [[Commonwealth realm|realm]] within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]] and [[Official bilingualism in Canada|officially bilingual]] at the federal level. It [[International rankings of Canada|ranks among the highest]] in international measurements of government transparency, civil liberties, quality of life, economic freedom, and education. It is one of the world's most ethnically diverse and [[Multiculturalism in Canada|multicultural]] nations, the product of [[Immigration to Canada|large-scale immigration]] from many other countries. Canada's [[Canada–United States relations|long and complex relationship]] with the United States has had a significant impact on its [[Economy of Canada|economy]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]].

A [[developed country]], Canada has the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|fifteenth-highest]] nominal per capita income globally as well as the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|twelfth-highest]] ranking in the [[Human Development Index]]. Its advanced economy is the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|tenth-largest in the world]], relying chiefly upon its abundant natural resources and well-developed international trade networks. Canada is part of several major international and intergovernmental institutions or groupings including the [[United Nations]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]] (formerly [[Group of Eight|G8]]), the [[Group of Ten (economics)|Group of Ten]], the [[G20]], the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] and the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] forum.

[[File:Political map of Canada.png|upright=2|thumb|right|A political map of Canada showing its 10 provinces and 3 territories|link=Provinces and territories of Canada]]
Canada is a federation composed of ten provinces and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]]. In turn, these may be grouped into [[List of regions of Canada|four main regions]]: [[Western Canada]], [[Central Canada]], [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Northern Canada]] (''[[Eastern Canada]]'' refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories, having responsibility for social programs such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[Social programs in Canada|welfare]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=G.

Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jason Clemens|author2=Niels Veldhuis|title=Beyond Equalization: Examining Fiscal Transfers in a Broader Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yc6RakXxLy0C&pg=PA8|year=2012|publisher=[[Fraser Institute]]|isbn=978-0-88975-215-3|page=8|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412150638/https://books.google.com/books?id=yc6RakXxLy0C&pg=PA8|archivedate=April 12, 2016}}</ref> The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their power and authority from the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (formerly called the ''[[British North America Acts|British North America Act]], 1867''), whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the [[Parliament of Canada]]. The powers flowing from the Constitution Act are divided between the [[Government of Canada]] (the federal government) and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively. A change to the division of powers between the federal government and the provinces requires a [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|constitutional amendment]], whereas a similar change affecting the territories can be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada or government.<ref name="Nicholson1979">{{cite book|first=Norman L. |last=Nicholson|title=The boundaries of the Canadian Confederation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ek7cloNk3E8C&pg=PA174|year=1979|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP|isbn=978-0-7705-1742-7|pages=174–175}}</ref>

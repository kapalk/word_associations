'''Croatia''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Croatia.ogg|k|r|oʊ|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}, {{respell|kroh|AY|shə}}; {{lang-hr|Hrvatska}}, {{IPA-sh|xř̩ʋaːtskaː|pron}}), officially the '''Republic of Croatia''' ({{lang-hr|Republika Hrvatska|links=no}}, {{Audio|Hr-Republika Hrvatska.oga|listen}}){{efn|IPA transcription of "''Republika Hrvatska''": ({{IPA-sh|ˈrepǔblika ˈxř̩ʋaːtskaː|hr}}).}}, is a country at the crossroads of [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Southeast Europe]], on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].

Inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]], the [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into two duchies by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirović dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian–Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].

Following the Axis [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, most of the Croatian territory was incorporated into the [[Independent State of Croatia|Nazi-backed client-state]] which led to the development of a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] and the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]] which after the war become a founding member and a federal constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.

The  [[sovereign state]] of Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]] and a [[developed country]] with a [[very high standard of living]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008–2009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].

[[Croatia's economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]] and [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture. [[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] is a significant source of revenue, with Croatia ranked among the [[World Tourism rankings|top 20]] most popular tourist destinations in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important [[trading partner]]. Croatia provides a [[social security]], [[Healthcare in Croatia|universal health care]] system, and a tuition-free [[Education in Croatia|primary and secondary education]], while supporting [[Culture of Croatia|culture]] through numerous public institutions and corporate investments in [[Media of Croatia|media]] and [[Croatian literature|publishing]].

{{Main|Name of Croatia}}

[[File:Greda i zabat s natpisom kneza Branimira 879.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Branimir Inscription]] is the oldest preserved monument containing an inscription defining a Croatian medieval ruler as a duke of Croats]]
The [[name of Croatia]] derives from [[Medieval Latin]] ''Croātia''. Itself a derivation of [[North-West Slavic]] ''*Xrovat-'', by [[liquid metathesis]] from Common Slavic period ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Slavic/xorvatъ|*''Xorvat'']]'', from proposed [[Proto-Slavic]] ''*Xъrvátъ'' which possibly comes from [[Old Persian]] ''*xaraxwat-''.<ref name="Gluhak-1993">{{cite book|author=Alemko Gluhak|title=Hrvatski etimološki rječnik|trans-title=Croatian Etymological Dictionary|language=Croatian|publisher=August Cesarec|year=1993|isbn=953-162-000-8}}</ref> The word is attested by the [[Old Iranian]] toponym ''Harahvait-'' which is the native name of [[Arachosia]].

The origin of the name is uncertain, but is thought to be a [[Gothic language|Gothic]] or [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] term assigned to a [[Slavic tribe]].<ref name="KU-Greenberg">{{cite web| publisher=[[University of Kansas]]| author= Marc L.

The first attestation of the Latin term is attributed to a charter of Duke [[Trpimir]] from the year 852. The original is lost, and just a 1568 copy is preserved, leading to doubts over the authenticity of the claim.{{sfn|Mužić|2007|p=27}} The oldest preserved stone inscription is the 9th-century Branimir Inscription found near [[Benkovac]], where Duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]] is styled ''Dux Cruatorvm''. The [[inscription]] is not believed to be dated accurately, but is likely to be from during the period of 879–892, during Branimir's rule.{{sfn|Mužić|2007|p=|pp=195–198}}

Following the end of the war, Croatia faced the challenges of post-war reconstruction, the return of refugees, advancing democratic principles, protection of human rights and general social and economic development. The post-2000 period is characterized by democratization, economic growth and structural and social reforms, as well as problems such as unemployment, corruption and the inefficiency of the public administration.

The hilly northern parts of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]] and the flat plains of Slavonia in the east which is part of the [[Pannonian Basin]] are traversed by major rivers such as [[Danube]], [[Drava]], [[Kupa]], and [[Sava]]. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of [[Vukovar]] in the extreme east and forms part of the border with [[Vojvodina]]. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands.

=== Biodiversity ===
{{Main|Protected areas of Croatia}}

Croatia can be subdivided between a number of [[ecoregion]]s because of its climate and geomorphology. The country is consequently one of the richest in Europe in terms of biodiversity. There are four types of biogeographical regions in Croatia—Mediterranean along the coast and in its immediate hinterland, Alpine in most of Lika and Gorski Kotar, Pannonian along Drava and Danube, and continental in the remaining areas. One of the most significant are [[karst]] habitats which include submerged karst, such as [[Zrmanja]] and [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] canyons and tufa barriers, as well as underground habitats.

[[File:Kopački rit wooden trail.JPG|thumb|right|Wooden trail through [[nature park]] [[Kopački Rit]] in [[Osijek-Baranja County]]]]
The karst geology harbours approximately 7,000 caves and pits, some of which are the habitat of the only known aquatic cave [[vertebrate]]—the [[olm]]. Forests are also significantly present in the country, as they cover {{convert|2490000|ha||abbr=off}} representing 44% of Croatian land surface.

In terms of [[phytogeography]], Croatia is a part of the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is a part of Illyrian and Central European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and the Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Region]]. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] divides Croatia between three ecoregions—Pannonian mixed forests, [[Dinaric Mountains mixed forests]] and [[Illyrian deciduous forests]].<ref name="DU-Sustdev">{{cite web|publisher=6th Dubrovnik Conference on Sustainable Development of Energy, Water and Environment Systems|url=http://www.dubrovnik2011.sdewes.org/venue.php|title=Venue|accessdate=13 October 2011}}</ref>

There are 37,000 known species in Croatia, but their actual number is estimated to be between 50,000 and 100,000.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/> The claim is supported by nearly 400 new taxa of [[invertebrate]]s discovered in Croatia in the first half of the 2000s alone.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/> There are more than a thousand endemic species, especially in Velebit and Biokovo mountains, Adriatic islands and karst rivers. Legislation protects 1,131 species.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/>
The most serious threat to species is loss and degradation of habitats. A further problem is presented by invasive alien species, especially ''[[Caulerpa taxifolia]]'' algae.

The invasive algae are regularly monitored and removed to protect the [[benthic habitat]]. Indigenous sorts of cultivated plants and breeds of domesticated animals are also numerous. Those include five breeds of horses, five breeds of cattle, eight breeds of sheep, two breeds of pigs, and a poultry breed. Even the indigenous breeds include nine endangered or critically endangered ones.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/> There are 444 [[protected areas of Croatia]], encompassing 9% of the country. Those include eight [[List of national parks of Croatia|national parks]], two strict reserves, and ten [[nature park]]s. The most famous protected area and the oldest [[national park]] in Croatia is the [[Plitvice Lakes National Park]], a [[World Heritage Sites in Croatia|UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. Velebit Nature Park is a part of the UNESCO [[Man and the Biosphere Programme]]. The strict and special reserves, as well as the national and nature parks, are managed and protected by the central government, while other protected areas are managed by counties. In 2005, the National Ecological Network was set up, as the first step in the preparation of the EU accession and joining of the [[Natura 2000]] network.<ref name="MCult-Biodiversity"/>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Winter bora in Senj.jpg|thumb|[[Bora (wind)|Bora]] is a dry, cold wind which blows from the mainland out to sea, whose gusts can reach hurricane strength, particularly in the channel below [[Velebit]], e.g. in the town of [[Senj]]]]
Most of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy [[continental climate]] as defined by the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Mean monthly temperature ranges between {{convert|-3|°C|°F|lk=on}} in January and {{convert|18|°C|°F|lk=off}} in July. The coldest parts of the country are [[Lika]] and [[Gorski Kotar]] where snowy forested climate is found at elevations above {{convert|1200|m|ft|abbr=off}}. The warmest areas of Croatia are at the Adriatic coast and especially in its immediate hinterland characterised by the [[Mediterranean climate]], as the temperature highs are moderated by the sea. Consequently, temperature peaks are more pronounced in the continental areas. The lowest temperature of {{convert|-35.5|°C|°F|lk=off}} was recorded on 3 February 1919 in [[Čakovec]], and the highest temperature of {{convert|42.8|°C|°F|lk=off}} was recorded on 4 August 1981 in [[Ploče]].{{sfn|Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015||p=42}}<ref name="record temp">{{cite web|title=Najviša izmjerena temperatura zraka u Hrvatskoj za razdoblje od kada postoje meteorološka motrenja|url=http://klima.hr/razno.php?id=priopcenja&param=pr21072017|website=Klima.hr|publisher=[[Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service]]|accessdate=1 August 2017|language=hr|date=21 July 2017}}</ref>

Mean annual precipitation ranges between {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=off}} and {{convert|3500|mm|in|abbr=off}} depending on geographic region and prevailing climate type. The least precipitation is recorded in the outer islands ([[Biševo]], [[Lastovo]], [[Svetac]], [[Vis (island)|Vis]]) and in the eastern parts of Slavonia. However, in the latter case, it occurs mostly during the [[growing season]]. The maximum precipitation levels are observed on the Dinara mountain range and in Gorski kotar.{{sfn|Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015|p=42}}

Prevailing winds in the interior are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and in the coastal area, prevailing winds are determined by local area features. Higher wind velocities are more often recorded in cooler months along the coast, generally as the cool northeasterly [[Bora (wind)|bura]] or less frequently as the warm southerly [[jugo]]. The sunniest parts of the country are the outer islands, Hvar and Korčula, where more than 2700&nbsp;hours of sunshine are recorded per year, followed by the middle and southern Adriatic Sea area in general, and northern Adriatic coast, all with more than 2000&nbsp;hours of sunshine per year.{{sfn|Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Croatia 2015|p=43}}

=== Law and judicial system ===
{{further|Law of Croatia}}
[[File:Ustavni sud RH nakon obnove.jpg|thumb|Seat of the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]] on the [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb]]]]
Croatia has a [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal system in which law arises primarily from written statutes, with judges serving merely as implementers and not creators of law. Its development was largely influenced by German and Austrian legal systems. Croatian law is divided into two principal areas—[[Civil law (Civil law)|private]] and [[public law]]. By the time [[Accession of Croatia to the European Union|EU accession negotiations]] were completed on 30 June 2010, Croatian legislation was fully harmonised with the [[Community acquis]].<ref name="DELHRV-overview">{{cite web|publisher=Delegation of the European Union to the Republic of Croatia|url=http://www.delhrv.ec.europa.eu/?lang=en&content=62|title=Overview of EU–Croatia relations|accessdate=14 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326105744/http://www.delhrv.ec.europa.eu/?lang=en&content=62|archivedate=26 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The main law in the county is the Constitution adopted on December 22, 1990.

The main national courts are the [[Constitutional Court of Croatia|Constitutional Court]], which oversees violations of the Constitution, and the [[Supreme Court of Croatia|Supreme Court]], which is the highest court of appeal. In addition, there are also Administrative, Commercial, [[County Court|County]], Misdemeanor, and Municipal courts.<ref name="VSRH-about">{{cite web|publisher=[[Croatian Supreme Court]]|url=http://www.vsrh.hr/EasyWeb.asp?pcpid=31|language=Croatian|title=Ustavne odredbe|trans-title=Provisions of the Constitution|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=14 October 2011}}</ref> Cases falling within judicial jurisdiction are in the first instance decided by a single professional judge, while appeals are deliberated in mixed tribunals of professional judges.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Further|Counties of Croatia|NUTS of Croatia}}
Croatia was first subdivided into counties in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="Medieval-Counties">{{cite journal |publisher=[[Školska knjiga]] |journal=Historijski zbornik |volume=5 |issue=1–2 |year=1952 |format=PDF |url=http://www.historiografija.hr/hz/1952/HZ_5_11_MANDIC.pdf |author=Oleg Mandić |language=Croatian |title=O nekim pitanjima društvenog uređenja Hrvatske u srednjem vijeku |trans-title=On some issues of social system of Croatia in the Middle Ages |pages=131–138 |accessdate=9 September 2011}}</ref> The divisions changed over time to reflect losses of territory to Ottoman conquest and subsequent liberation of the same territory, changes of political status of Dalmatia, Dubrovnik, and [[Istria]]. The traditional division of the country into counties was abolished in the 1920s when the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and the subsequent Kingdom of Yugoslavia introduced [[oblast]]s and [[Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovinas]] respectively.{{sfn|Frucht|2005|p=429}}

Communist-ruled Croatia, as a constituent part of post-World War II Yugoslavia, abolished earlier divisions and introduced municipalities, subdividing Croatia into approximately one hundred municipalities. Counties were reintroduced in 1992 legislation, significantly altered in terms of territory relative to the pre-1920s subdivisions. In 1918, the [[Transleithania]]n part of Croatia was divided into eight counties with their seats in [[Bjelovar]], [[Gospić]], [[Ogulin]], [[Osijek]], [[Požega, Croatia|Požega]], [[Varaždin]], Vukovar, and Zagreb, and the 1992 legislation established 14 counties in the same territory.{{sfn|Biondich|2000|p=11}}<ref name="CountiesAct1992">{{cite news|newspaper=[[Narodne novine]] |date=30 December 1992 |accessdate=9 September 2011 |language=Croatian |title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj |trans-title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act |url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_12_90_2333.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828162010/http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/1992_12_90_2333.html |archivedate=28 August 2013 }}</ref>

Since the counties were re-established in 1992, Croatia is divided into 20 [[Counties of Croatia|counties]] and the [[capital city of Zagreb]], the latter having the authority and legal status of a county and a city at the same time. Borders of the counties changed in some instances since, with the latest revision taking place in 2006. The counties subdivide into 127 [[List of cities in Croatia|cities]] and 429 [[Municipalities of Croatia|municipalities]].<ref name="CountiesAct2006">{{cite news|newspaper=Narodne novine|date=28 July 2006|accessdate=9 September 2011|language=Croatian|title=Zakon o područjima županija, gradova i općina u Republici Hrvatskoj|trans-title=Territories of Counties, Cities and Municipalities of the Republic of Croatia Act|url=http://narodne-novine.nn.hr/clanci/sluzbeni/2006_07_86_2045.html}}</ref> [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]] (NUTS) [[division of Croatia]] is performed in several tiers. NUTS 1 level places the entire country in a single unit, while there are three NUTS 2 regions. Those are Northwest Croatia, Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia, and Adriatic Croatia. The latter encompasses all the counties along the Adriatic coast. Northwest Croatia includes Koprivnica-Križevci, Krapina-Zagorje, Međimurje, Varaždin, the city of Zagreb, and Zagreb counties and the Central and Eastern (Pannonian) Croatia includes the remaining areas—Bjelovar-Bilogora, Brod-Posavina, Karlovac, Osijek-Baranja, Požega-Slavonia, Sisak-Moslavina, Virovitica-Podravina, and Vukovar-Syrmia counties. Individual counties and the city of Zagreb also represent NUTS 3 level subdivision units in Croatia. The NUTS [[Local administrative unit]] divisions are two-tiered. LAU 1 divisions match the counties and the city of Zagreb in effect making those the same as NUTS 3 units, while LAU 2 subdivisions correspond to the cities and municipalities of Croatia.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Council of Europe]]|format=PDF|language=Croatian|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/heritage/cemat/confminist1-15/15eCEMAT_National_Report_Croatia_2010_HR.pdf|title=Nacionalno izviješće Hrvatska|trans-title=Croatia National Report|date=January 2010|accessdate=25 February 2012}}</ref>

'''Angola''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Angola-pronunciation.ogg|æ|n|ˈ|ɡ|oʊ|l|ə}}; {{IPA-pt|ɐ̃ˈɡɔlɐ|lang}}), officially the '''Republic of Angola''' ({{lang-pt|República de Angola}}; [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu]] and {{lang-umb|Repubilika ya Ngola}}), is a west-coast country of [[Southern Africa|south]]-[[central Africa]]. It is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]], bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west. Angola has an [[exclave]] province, the province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] that borders the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The capital and largest city of Angola is [[Luanda]].

Although inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Era]], what is now Angola was molded by [[Portuguese colonization of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]]. It began with, and was for centuries limited to, coastal settlements and [[trading post]]s established starting in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. The [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]] that became Angola did not have its present borders until the early 20th century because of resistance by groups such as the Cuamato, the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]].

After a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]], independence was achieved in 1975 as the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[People's Republic of Angola]], a [[one-party state]] supported by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]]. The [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between the ruling [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA) and the insurgent anti-communist [[National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]] (UNITA), supported by the United States and [[South Africa]], lasted until 2002. The [[sovereign state]] has since become a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]], [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic|constitutional republic]].

Angola has vast [[Mineral reserve|mineral]] and [[petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest-growing in the world, especially since the end of the civil war; however, the [[standard of living]] remains low for most of the population, and [[life expectancy]] in Angola is among the lowest in the world, while [[infant mortality]] is among the highest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html}}</ref> Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with most of the nation's [[wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small sector of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|title=Transparency and Accountability in Angola|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=1 April 2016}}</ref>

Angola is a member state of the [[United Nations]], [[OPEC]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]]. A highly multiethnic country, Angola's 25.8 million people span tribal groups, customs, and traditions. Angolan culture reflects centuries of Portuguese rule, in the predominance of the [[Portuguese language]] and of the [[Catholic Church]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Angola'' comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] colonial name ''[[Angola (Portugal)|Reino de Angola]] (Kingdom of Angola)'', which appeared as early as [[Dias de Novais]]'s 1571 charter.<ref>Heywood, Linda M. & Thornton, John K. (2007) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=S42CypbRTlQC&pg=PA82 Central Africans, Atlantic Creoles, and the foundation of the Americas, 1585–1660]''. Cambridge University Press. p. 82. {{ISBN|0521770653}}</ref> The [[toponym]] was derived by the Portuguese from the title ''[[List of Ngolas of Ndongo|ngola]]'' held by the kings of [[Kingdom of Ndongo|Ndongo]]. Ndongo in the [[highland]]s, between the [[Kwanza River|Kwanza]] and [[Lukala River]]s, was nominally a possession of the [[Kingdom of Kongo]], but was seeking greater independence in the 16th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/kingdom-kongo-1390-1914|title=Kingdom of Kongo 1390 – 1914|last=Leander|date=2016-05-18|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-02-25}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Angola}}

===Early migrations and political units===
[[File:KingdomNdongo1711.png|thumb|left|Territory comprising [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], present-day Angola]]
Modern Angola was populated predominantly by [[nomad]]ic [[Khoi]] and [[San people|San]] prior to the first [[Bantu migration]]s. The Khoi and San peoples were neither [[Pastoralism|pastoralist]]s nor [[cultivator]]s, but [[hunter-gatherer]]s.<ref name=Henderson>{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Lawrence|title=Angola: Five Centuries of Conflict|date=1979|pages=40–42|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=978-0812216202}}</ref> They were displaced by [[Bantu peoples]] arriving from the north, most of whom likely originated in what is today northwestern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Niger]].<ref name=Miller1>{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Josep h|title=Kings and Kinsmen: Early Mbundu States in Angola|date=1979|pages=55–56|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=978-0198227045}}</ref> Bantu speakers introduced the cultivation of [[banana]]s and [[taro]], as well as large cattle herds, to Angola's central highlands and the Luanda plain. Hendese Bantu established a number of political entities; the best-known of these was the [[Kingdom of the Kongo]], based in Angola, which extended northward to what is now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Gabon]]. It established [[trade route]]s with other city-states and civilisations up and down the coast of southwestern and western Africa and even with [[Great Zimbabwe]] and the [[Mutapa Empire]], although it engaged in little or no transoceanic trade.<ref name="The Story of Africa">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page45.shtml|title=The Story of Africa|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> To its south lay the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]], from which the area of the later Portuguese colony was sometimes known as ''Dongo''.{{sfnp|EB|1878}}

===Portuguese colonisation===
{{Main|Colonial history of Angola|Portuguese Angola|Dutch Loango-Angola}}
[[File:Queen Nzinga 1657.png|thumb|[[Queen Nzinga]] in peace negotiations with the Portuguese governor in [[Luanda]], 1657.]]
[[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Age of Discovery|explorer]] [[Diogo Cão]] reached the area in 1484.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} The previous year, the Portuguese had established relations with the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]], which stretched at the time from modern [[Gabon]] in the north to the [[Kwanza River]] in the south. The Portuguese established their primary early trading post at [[Soyo]], which is now the northernmost city in Angola apart from the [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] [[exclave]]. [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded São Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575 with a hundred families of settlers and four hundred soldiers. [[Benguela]] was fortified in 1587 and became a township in 1617.

The Portuguese established several other settlements, forts and trading posts along the Angolan coast, principally trading in [[Slavery in Angola|Angolan slaves]] for [[Captaincies of Brazil|Brazilian]] [[plantations in the American South|plantations]]. Local slave dealers provided a large number of slaves for the [[Portuguese Empire]],<ref name=Fleisch>{{cite encyclopedia|author=Fleisch, Axel|title=Angola: Slave Trade, Abolition of|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History 3-Volume Set|editor-last=Shillington|editor-first=Kevin|volume=1|pages=131–133|publisher=Routledge|year=2004|isbn=1-57958-245-1}}</ref> usually in exchange for manufactured goods from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|title=Angola in the Eighteenth Century: Slave trading in the 1700s|work=Angola President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos Handbook|author=Global Investment and Business Center|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|date=1 January 2006|page=153|isbn=0739716069}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|accessdate=14 May 2016|page=27|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/AFRICAEXT/Resources/africa-brazil-bridging-chapter2.pdf|title=The History of Brazil–Africa Relations|author=World Bank|work=Bridging the Atlantic}}</ref>

Despite Portugal's territorial claims in Angola, its control over much of the country's vast interior was minimal.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} In the 16th century Portugal gained control of the coast through a series of treaties and wars. Life for European colonists was difficult and progress slow. [[John Iliffe (historian)|John Iliffe]] notes that "Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great [[famine]] occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys".<ref>Iliffe, John (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC ''Africans: the history of a continent'']. Cambridge University Press. p. 68. {{ISBN|0-521-68297-5}}. For valuable complements for the 16th and 17th centuries see Beatrix Heintze, ''Studien zur Geschichte Angolas im 16. und 17.

[[File:Kongo audience.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration depicting Portuguese encounter with Kongo Royal family.]]
During the [[Portuguese Restoration War]], the [[Dutch West India Company]] [[Dutch Loango-Angola|occupied]] the principal settlement of Luanda in 1641, using alliances with local peoples to carry out attacks against Portuguese holdings elsewhere.<ref name="Handbook"/> A fleet under [[Salvador de Sá]] retook Luanda in 1648; reconquest of the rest of the territory was completed by 1650. New treaties with the [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]] were signed in 1649; others with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Njinga]]'s Kingdom of [[Matamba]] and [[Ndongo]] followed in 1656. The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed. Colonial outposts also expanded inward from Benguela, but until the late 19th century the inroads from Luanda and Benguela were very limited.{{sfnp|EB|1878}} Hamstrung by a series of political upheavals in the early 1800s, Portugal was slow to mount a large scale annexation of Angolan territory.<ref name="Handbook"/>

The [[slave trade]] was abolished in Angola in 1836, and in 1854 the colonial government freed all its existing slaves.<ref name="Handbook"/> Four years later, a more progressive administration appointed by Lisbon abolished [[slavery]] altogether. However, these decrees remained largely unenforceable, and the Portuguese depended on assistance from the British [[Royal Navy]] to enforce their ban on the slave trade.<ref name="Handbook"/> This coincided with a series of renewed military expeditions into the [[hinterland]]. By the mid-nineteenth century Portugal had established its dominion as far east as the [[Congo River]] and as far south as [[Moçâmedes|Mossâmedes]].<ref name="Handbook"/> Until the late 1880s, Lisbon entertained proposals to link Angola with its [[colony]] in [[Mozambique]] but was blocked by British and Belgian opposition.<ref name=Corrado>{{cite book|last=Corrado|first=Jacopo|title=The Creole Elite and the Rise of Angolan Protonationalism: 1870–1920|date=2008|pages=11–13|publisher=Cambria Press|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=978-1604975291}}</ref> In this period, the Portuguese came up against different forms of armed resistance from various peoples in Angola.<ref>See René Pélissier, ''Les guerres grises: Résistance et revoltes en Angola, (1845-1941)'', Éditions Pélissier, Montamets, 78630 Orgeval (France), 1977</ref>

The [[Berlin Conference]] in 1884–1885 set the colony's borders, delineating the boundaries of Portuguese claims in Angola,<ref name=Corrado/> although many details were unresolved until the 1920s.<ref>See René Pélissier, ''La colonie du Minotaure. Nationalismes et révoltes en Angola (1926–1961)'', éditions Pélissier, Montamets, 78630 Orgeval (France), 1979</ref> Trade between Portugal and her African territories also rapidly increased as a result of protective [[tariff]]s, leading to increased development, and a wave of new Portuguese immigrants.<ref name=Corrado/>

A largely [[Ovimbundu]] guerrilla initiative against the Portuguese in central Angola from 1966 was spearheaded by [[Jonas Savimbi]] and the ''[[UNITA|National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]]'' (UNITA).<ref name="Hanlon"/> It remained handicapped by its geographic remoteness from friendly borders, the ethnic fragmentation of the Ovimbundu, and the isolation of peasants on European plantations where they had little opportunity to mobilise.<ref name="Chabal"/>
[[File:F.N.L.A. in Zaïre.jpg|thumb|left|FNLA insurgents being trained in [[Zaire]] in 1973]]
During the late 1950s, the rise of the Marxist–Leninist ''[[MPLA|Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]]'' (MPLA) in the east and Dembos hills north of Luanda came to hold special significance.

The MPLA attempted to move its headquarters from [[Conakry]] to Léopoldville in October 1961, renewing efforts to create a common front with the FNLA, then known as the ''Union of Angolan Peoples'' (UPA) and its leader [[Holden Roberto]]. Roberto turned down the offer.<ref name="Cornwell"/> When the MPLA first attempted to insert its own insurgents into Angola, the cadres were ambushed and annihilated by UPA partisans on Roberto's orders—setting a precedent for the bitter factional strife which would later ignite the [[Angolan Civil War]].<ref name="Cornwell"/>

On 22 March 2002, Jonas Savimbi was killed in action against government troops. UNITA and the MPLA reached a cease-fire shortly afterwards. UNITA gave up its armed wing and assumed the role of a major opposition party. Although the political situation of the country began to stabilise, regular democratic processes did not prevail until the [[elections in Angola]] in 2008 and 2012 and the adoption of a new [[Constitution of Angola|constitution]] in 2010, all of which strengthened the prevailing [[dominant-party system]].

Angola has a serious humanitarian crisis; the result of the prolonged war, of the abundance of [[minefield]]s, of the continued political (and to a much lesser degree) military activities in favour of the independence of the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] (carried out in the context of the protracted [[Cabinda War|Cabinda conflict]] by the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda|FLEC]]), but most of all, by the depredation of the country's rich mineral resources by the régime.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} While most of the internally displaced have now settled around the capital, in the so-called ''[[wikt:musseque|musseque]]s'', the general situation for Angolans remains desperate.<ref>Lari (2004), Human Rights Watch (2005)</ref><ref>For an overall analysis see Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, Magnificent and Beggar Land: Angola since the Civil War, London: Hurst, 2015</ref>

Angola, although located in a [[tropical zone]], has a climate that is not characterized for this region, due to the confluence of three factors:

*The [[Benguela Current]], cold, along the southern part of the coast;
*The relief in the interior;
*Influence of the [[Namib Desert]] in the southwest.

As a result, Angola's climate is characterized by two seasons: rainfall from October to April and drought, known as ''Cacimbo'', from May to August, drier, as the name implies, and with lower temperatures. On the other hand, while the coastline has high rainfall rates, decreasing from North to South and from {{convert|800|mm|abbr=off}} to {{convert|50|mm|abbr=off}}, with average annual temperatures above {{convert|23|°C}}, the interior zone can be divided into three areas:

*North, with high rainfall and high temperatures;
*Central Plateau, with a dry season and average temperatures of the order of 19&nbsp;°C;
*South with very high thermal amplitudes due to the proximity of the [[Kalahari Desert]] and the influence of masses of tropical air.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Mulenga, Henry Mubanga|year=1999|title=Southern African climate anomalies, summer rainfall and the Angola low|series=PhD Dissertation|publisher=University of Cape Town|oclc=85939351}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Jury, M.

The Angolan government is composed of three branches of government: executive, legislative and judicial. The executive branch of the government is composed of the President, the Vice-Presidents and the Council of Ministers. The legislative branch comprises a 220-seat [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature elected from both provincial and nationwide constituencies. For decades, political power has been concentrated in the presidency.

The [[Constitution of Angola|Constitution of 2010]] establishes the broad outlines of government structure and delineates the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system is based on Portuguese law and customary law but is weak and fragmented, and courts operate in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Angola|url=https://www.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/angola/19488.htm|website=State.gov|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=22 November 2016}}</ref> A Supreme Court serves as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court does not hold the powers of [[judicial review]].<ref name="CIA"/> Governors of the 18 provinces are appointed by the president.

After the end of the civil war the regime came under pressure from within as well as from the international community to become more democratic and less authoritarian. Its reaction was to implement a number of changes without substantially changing its character.<ref>Péclard, Didier (ed.) (2008) ''L'Angola dans la paix: Autoritarisme et reconversions'', special issue of ''Politique africains'' (Paris), p. 110.</ref>

Angola scored poorly on the 2013 [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]]. It was ranked 39 out of 52 [[sub-Saharan Africa]]n countries, scoring particularly badly in the areas of participation and human rights, sustainable economic opportunity and human development. The Ibrahim Index uses a number of variables to compile its list which reflects the state of governance in Africa.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/iiag/| title=Ibrahim Index of African Governance| publisher=Mo Ibrahim Foundation| accessdate=9 August 2014}}</ref>

The [[Constitution of Angola|new constitution]], adopted in 2010, did away with presidential elections, introducing a system in which the president and the vice-president of the political party that wins the parliamentary elections automatically become president and vice-president. Directly or indirectly, the president controls all other organs of the state, so there is ''de facto'' no [[separation of powers]].<ref>Miranda, Jorge (2010) "A Constituição de Angola de 2010", ''O Direito'' (Lisbon), vol. 142.</ref> In the classifications used in constitutional law, this government falls under the category of ''authoritarian regime.'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=Angola Party Politics: Into the African Trend|last=Amundsen|first=Inge|publisher=Chr.

On 16 October 2014, Angola was elected for the second time as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council, with 190 favourable votes out of 193.

[[File:Angolan soldiers training in Russia.png|thumb|[[Angolan Army]] training in Russia. From left to right, the ranks of the men are Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant, and Captain.]]
The Angolan Armed Forces (AAF) are headed by a Chief of Staff who reports to the Minister of Defence. There are three divisions—the Army (Exército), Navy (Marinha de Guerra, MGA) and [[National Air Force of Angola|National Air Force]] (Força Aérea Nacional, FAN). Total manpower is about 110,000.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Its equipment includes Russian-manufactured fighters, bombers and transport planes. There are also Brazilian-made [[EMB-312 Tucano]]s for training, Czech-made L-39s for training and bombing, and a variety of western-made aircraft such as the C-212\Aviocar, Sud Aviation Alouette III, etc. A small number of AAF personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville).

===Police===
The National Police departments are Public Order, Criminal Investigation, Traffic and Transport, Investigation and Inspection of Economic Activities, Taxation and Frontier Supervision, Riot Police and the Rapid Intervention Police. The National Police are in the process of standing up an air wing,{{when|date=November 2017}} to provide helicopter support for operations. The National Police are developing their criminal investigation and forensic capabilities. The force has an estimated 6,000 patrol officers, 2,500 taxation and frontier supervision officers, 182 criminal investigators and 100 financial crimes detectives and around 90 economic activity inspectors.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The National Police have implemented a modernisation and development plan to increase the capabilities and efficiency of the total force. In addition to administrative reorganisation, modernisation projects include procurement of new vehicles, aircraft and equipment, construction of new police stations and forensic laboratories, restructured training programmes and the replacement of [[AKM rifle]]s with 9&nbsp;mm [[Uzi]]s for officers in urban areas.

===Justice===
A Supreme Court serves as a court of appeal. The Constitutional Court is the supreme body of the constitutional jurisdiction, established with the approval of Law no. 2/08, of 17 June – Organic Law of the Constitutional Court and Law n. 3/08, of 17 June – Organic Law of the Constitutional Process. The legal system is based on Portuguese and customary laws, but it is weak and fragmented. There are only 12 courts in more than 140 counties in the country. Its first task was the validation of the candidacies of the political parties to the legislative elections of 5 September 2008. Thus, on 25 June 2008, the Constitutional Court was institutionalized and its Judicial Counselors assumed the position before the President of the Republic. Currently, seven advisory judges are present, four men and three women.

In 2014, a new penal code took effect in Angola. The classification of [[money-laundering]] as a crime is one of the novelties in the new legislation.<ref>[http://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/280463/angola-com-novo-codigo-penal-ainda-este-ano Angola com novo Código Penal ainda este ano], Notícias ao Minuto, 24 September 2014</ref>

===Exclave of Cabinda===
{{Main|Cabinda (province)|l1=Cabinda|Republic of Cabinda}}
[[File:Flag of Cabinda (FLEC propose).svg|thumb|left|Flag of the [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda|Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda (FLEC)]]]]
With an area of approximately {{convert|7283|km2|sqmi}}, the Northern Angolan province of Cabinda is unusual in being separated from the rest of the country by a strip, some {{convert|60|km}} wide, of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] along the lower [[Congo River]]. Cabinda borders the [[Congo Republic]] to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population centre.

According to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighbouring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, "the Kuwait of Africa". Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output.<ref>{{cite news|title=Angola profile|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732| publisher=BBC News| date=22 December 2013}}</ref> Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese rule]] by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.

Ever since [[Portugal]] handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the [[Government of Angola]] (which has employed its armed forces, the FAA—Forças Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]]-[[Forças Armadas de Cabinda|Armed Forces of Cabinda]] (FLEC-FAC) announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago. One of the characteristics of the Cabindan independence movement is its constant fragmentation, into smaller and smaller factions.

Angola has diamonds, oil, gold, copper and a rich wildlife (dramatically impoverished during the civil war), forest and fossil fuels. Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource. Smallholder and [[plantation]] agriculture dramatically dropped in the [[Angolan Civil War]], but began to recover after 2002. The transformation industry{{clarify|date=November 2017}} of the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but it has begun to re-emerge with updated technologies, partly because of an influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs. Similar developments have taken place in the service sector.

Angola's economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by a quarter-century of [[Angolan civil war]] to become the fastest-growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest-growing in the world, with an average [[GDP]] growth of 20% between 2005 and 2007.<ref>[http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html Angola Financial Sector Profile: MFW4A – Making Finance Work for Africa].

China is Angola's biggest trade partner and [[export]] destination as well as the fourth-largest source of [[import]]s. Bilateral trade reached $27.67&nbsp;billion in 2011, up 11.5% year-on-year. China's imports, mainly [[crude oil]] and diamonds, increased 9.1% to $24.89&nbsp;billion while China's exports to Angola, including mechanical and electrical products, machinery parts and construction materials, surged 38.8%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://globaltradelogistic.com/logistics/africa/angola/|title=Angolo|last=|first=|date=|website=Global Trade Logistic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref> The oil [[Overproduction|glut]] led to a local [[price]] for unleaded gasoline of [[Pound sterling|£]]0.37 a gallon.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/8632811/Luanda-capital-of-Angola-retains-title-of-worlds-most-expensive-for-expats.html Luanda, capital of Angola, retains title of world's most expensive for expats.

The Angolan economy grew 18% in 2005, 26% in 2006 and 17.6% in 2007. Due to the global [[recession]] the economy contracted an estimated −0.3% in 2009.<ref name=CIA/> The security brought about by the 2002 peace settlement has allowed the resettlement of 4&nbsp;million displaced persons and a resulting large-scale increases in agriculture production.

Although the country's economy has grown significantly since Angola achieved political stability in 2002, mainly due to fast-rising earnings in the oil sector, Angola faces huge social and economic problems. These are in part a result of almost continual armed conflict from 1961 on, although the highest level of destruction and socio-economic damage took place after the 1975 independence, during the long years of [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]]. However, high [[poverty rate]]s and blatant [[social inequality]] chiefly stem from persistent [[authoritarianism]], "neo-patrimonial" practices at all levels of the political, administrative, military and economic structures, and of [[Corruption in Angola|a pervasive corruption]].<ref>Anti-corruption watchdog [[Transparency International]] rates Angola one of the 10 most corrupt countries in the world.</ref><ref>Dolan, Kerry A.

"Secondary beneficiaries" are the middle strata which are about to become [[social class]]es. However, almost half the population has to be considered poor, with dramatic differences between the countryside and the cities (where by now slightly more than 50% of the people live).

A study carried out in 2008 by the Angolan Instituto Nacional de Estatística found that in rural areas roughly 58% must be classified as "poor" according to UN norms, but in the urban areas only 19%, and an overall rate of 37%.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131026082704/http://www.exameangola.com/pt/?det=16943&id=2000&mid= País ao raios X].

The council of foreign affairs states that the World Bank mentioned that Sonangol " is a taxpayer, it carries out quasi-fiscal activities, it invests public funds, and, as concessionaire, it is a sector regulator. This multifarious work programme creates conflicts of interest and characterises a complex relationship between Sonangol and the government that weakens the formal budgetary process and creates uncertainty as regards the actual fiscal stance of the state."<ref>"Angola's political and economical development" [http://www.cfr.org/world/angolas-political-economic-development/p16820 (Council of Foreign Relation)http://www.cfr.org/world/angolas-political-economic-development/p16820]</ref>

Before independence in 1975, [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] was a breadbasket of southern Africa and a major exporter of [[banana]]s, coffee and [[sisal]], but [[Angolan Civil War|three decades of civil war]] (1975–2002) destroyed fertile countryside, left it littered with [[landmine]]s and drove millions into the cities. The country now depends on expensive food imports, mainly from South Africa and [[Portugal]], while more than 90% of farming is done at the family and subsistence level. Thousands of Angolan small-scale farmers are trapped in poverty.<ref>Redvers, Louise [http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=47123 POVERTY-ANGOLA: Inter Press Service News Agency – NGOs Sceptical of Govt's Rural Development Plans] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512215958/http://ipsnews.net/africa/nota.asp?idnews=47123|date=12 May 2010}}.</ref>

The enormous differences between the regions pose a serious structural problem for the Angolan economy, illustrated by the fact that about one third of economic activities are concentrated in Luanda and neighbouring Bengo province, while several areas of the interior suffer economic stagnation and even regression.<ref>Manuel Alves da Rocha (2010) [http://www.ceic-ucan.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/desigualdades-e-assimetrias-regionais-em-angola.pdf ''Desigualdades e assimetrias regionais em Angola: Os factores da competitividade territorial''], Luanda: Centro de Estudos e Investigação Científica da Universidade Católica de Angola.</ref>

One of the economic consequences of the social and regional disparities is a sharp increase in Angolan private investments abroad. The small fringe of Angolan society where most of the asset accumulation takes place seeks to spread its assets, for reasons of security and profit. For the time being, the biggest share of these investments is concentrated in Portugal where the [[Angolans in Portugal|Angolan presence]] (including the family of the state president) in banks as well as in the domains of energy, [[Telecommunications in Angola|telecommunications]], and [[mass media]] has become notable, as has the acquisition of vineyards and orchards as well as of touristic enterprises.<ref>"A força do kwanza", ''Visão'' (Lisbon), 993, 15 May 2012, pp. 50–54</ref>

According to this report, just slightly more than ten years after the end of the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] Angola's standard of living has overall greatly improved. Life expectancy, which was just 46 years in 2002, reached 51 in 2011. Mortality rates for children fell from 25 percent in 2001 to 19 percent in 2010 and the number of students enrolled in primary school has tripled since 2001.<ref>[https://www.bcgperspectives.com/Images/BCG_The_New_Prosperity_tcm80-133457.pdf The New Prosperity: Strategies for Improving Well-Being in Sub-Saharan Africa] Report by The Boston Consulting Group and Tony Blair Africa Governance Initiative, May 2013</ref> However, at the same time the social and economic inequality that has characterised the country since long has not diminished, but on the contrary deepened in all respects.

With a stock of assets corresponding to 70&nbsp;billion Kz (US$6.8&nbsp;billion), Angola is now the third largest financial market in sub-Saharan Africa, surpassed only by [[Nigeria]] and South Africa. According to the Angolan Minister of Economy, Abraão Gourgel, the financial market of the country grew modestly from 2002 and now lies in third place at the level of sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>[http://www.macauhub.com.mo/en/2014/07/23/angola-is-the-third-largest-sub-saharan-financial-market/ Angola is the third-largest sub-Saharan financial market], MacauHub, 23 July 2014</ref>

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Angola}}
Agriculture and forestry is an area of potential opportunity for the country. The African Economic Outlook organization states that "Angola requires 4.5 million tonnes a year of grain but grows only about 55% of the [[corn]] it needs, 20% of the [[rice]] and just 5% of its required [[wheat]]".<ref>Muzima, Joel.

===Transport===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Cargamento de mineirios, Namibe.JPG|thumb|Ship loading minerals at Namibe harbour, Angola.]]
Transport in Angola consists of:
*Three separate [[Rail transport in Angola|railway systems]] totalling {{convert|2,761|km|mi|abbr=on}}
*{{convert|76626|km|0|abbr=on}} of highway of which {{convert|19156|km|0|abbr=on}} is paved
*1,295 navigable inland waterways
*Eight major [[sea port]]s
*243 [[List of airports in Angola|airports]], of which 32 are paved.

Travel on highways outside of towns and cities in Angola (and in some cases within) is often not best advised for those without four-by-four vehicles. While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made.

Transport is an important aspect in Angola because it is strategically located and it could become a regional logistics hub. In addition Angola has some of the most important and biggest ports and so it is vital to connect them to the interior of the country as well as to neighbouring countries.

[[Tourism in Angola|Tourism]] is restarting on the heels of the long ended stop in the civil war, and very few tourists venture anywhere in Angola yet due to lack of infrastructure.

The languages in Angola are those originally spoken by the different ethnic groups and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], introduced during the Portuguese colonial era. The most widely spoken indigenous languages are [[Umbundu]], [[Kimbundu]] and [[Kikongo]], in that order. Portuguese is the official language of the country.

Although the exact numbers of those fluent in Portuguese or who speak Portuguese as a first language are unknown, a 2012 study mentions that Portuguese is the first language of 39% of the population.<ref>Silva, José António Maria da Conceição (2004) [http://poing.me/layar/Colombia/brochuranoCrop.pdf Angola]. 7th World Urban Forum</ref> In 2014, a census carried out by the Instituto Nacional de Estatística in Angola mentions that 71.15% of the nearly 25.8 million inhabitants of Angola (meaning around 18.3 million people) use Portuguese as a first or second language.<ref name="Angola: português é falado por 71,15% de angolanos">{{cite web|title=Angola: português é falado por 71,15% de angolanos|url=http://aiangola.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Publica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Resultados-Definitivos-Censo-Geral-2014_Vers%C3%A3o-22032016_DEFINITIVA-18H17.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226100353/http://aiangola.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Publica%C3%A7%C3%A3o-Resultados-Definitivos-Censo-Geral-2014_Vers%C3%A3o-22032016_DEFINITIVA-18H17.pdf|archivedate=26 December 2016}}</ref>

Foreign [[Missionary|missionaries]] were very active prior to independence in 1975, although since the beginning of the anti-colonial fight in 1961 the Portuguese colonial authorities expelled a series of Protestant missionaries and closed mission stations based on the belief that the missionaries were inciting pro-independence sentiments. Missionaries have been able to return to the country since the early 1990s, although security conditions due to the civil war have prevented them until 2002 from restoring many of their former inland mission stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5511.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report – Angola|publisher=U.S. Department of State|date=1 January 2004|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>

The diverse ethnic communities – the [[Ovimbundu]], [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]], [[Bakongo]], [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]], [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]] and other peoples – to varying degrees maintain their own cultural traits, traditions and languages, but in the cities, where slightly more than half of the population now lives, a mixed culture has been emerging since colonial times; in [[Luanda]], since its foundation in the 16th century. In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. African roots are evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of [[Angolan literature|Angolan authors]].

In 2014, Angola resumed the National Festival of Angolan Culture after a 25-year break. The festival took place in all the provincial capitals and lasted for 20 days, with the theme ''Culture as a Factor of Peace and Development''.<ref>[http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/lazer-e-cultura/2014/11/51/Retrospect2014-Fenacult-marks-cultural-year,58a0fcae-b594-4edd-bc8b-1d7e2e798f14.html Retrospect2014: Fenacult marks cultural year] Angola Press Agency, 18 December 2014</ref>

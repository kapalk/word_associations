Costa Rica was sparsely inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples of Costa Rica|indigenous peoples]] before coming under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] in the 16th century. It remained a peripheral colony of the empire until independence as part of the [[First Mexican Empire]], followed by membership in the [[United Provinces of Central America]], from which it formally declared independence in 1847. Since then, Costa Rica has remained among the most stable, prosperous, and progressive{{peacock term|date=October 2018}} nations in Latin America. Following the brief [[Costa Rican Civil War]], it permanently [[Military of Costa Rica|abolished its army]] in 1949, becoming one of only a few sovereign [[List of countries without armed forces|nations without a standing army]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elespiritudel48.org/docu/h013.htm|author=El Espíritu del 48|title=Abolición del Ejército|accessdate=9 March 2008|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=9 June 2009 |url=http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/CR/defense.html |title=Costa Rica |publisher=World Desk Reference |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211185659/http://dev.prenhall.com/divisions/hss/worldreference/CR/defense.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=9 June 2009|url=http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=39&regionSelect=4-Central_Americas|title=Costa Rica|publisher=Uppsala University}}</ref>

{{Main|History of Costa Rica}}
[[File:Stone sphere.jpg|thumb|A stone sphere created by the [[Diquis]] culture at the [[Museo Nacional de Costa Rica|National Museum of Costa Rica]]. [[Stone spheres of Costa Rica|The sphere]] is the icon of the country's cultural identity.]]

=== Pre-Columbian period ===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian history of Costa Rica}}
Historians have classified the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] of Costa Rica as belonging to the [[Intermediate Area]], where the peripheries of the [[Mesoamerican]] and [[Andean]] native cultures overlapped. More recently, [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] Costa Rica has also been described as part of the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].

Stone tools, the oldest evidence of human occupation in Costa Rica, are associated with the arrival of various groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s about 10,000 to 7,000 years [[Before Common Era|BCE]] in the [[Turrialba|Turrialba Valley]]. The presence of [[Clovis culture]] type spearheads and arrows from [[South America]] opens the possibility that, in this area, two different cultures coexisted.<ref name=precolumbian1>{{harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| pp=30–31|sp=yes}}</ref>

Agriculture became evident in the populations that lived in Costa Rica about 5,000 years ago. They mainly grew [[tubers]] and roots. For the first and second millennia BCE there were already settled farming communities. These were small and scattered, although the timing of the transition from [[hunter-gatherer|hunting]] and gathering to agriculture as the main livelihood in the territory is still unknown.<ref name=precolumbian2>{{harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| p=32|sp=yes}}</ref>

The earliest use of [[pottery]] appears around 2,000 to 3,000 BCE. Shards of pots, cylindrical vases, platters, gourds and other forms of vases decorated with grooves, prints, and some modelled after animals have been found.<ref name=precolumban3>{{harvnb|Botey Sobrado|2002| pp=32–33|sp=sí}}</ref>

The impact of indigenous peoples on modern Costa Rican culture has been relatively small compared to other nations, since the country lacked a strong native civilization to begin with. Most of the native population was absorbed into the Spanish-speaking [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial society]] through inter-marriage, except for some small remnants, the most significant of which are the [[Bribri people|Bribri]] and [[Boruca people|Boruca]] tribes who still inhabit the mountains of the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]], in the southeastern part of Costa Rica, near the frontier with [[Panama]].

=== Spanish colonization ===
The name {{lang|es|la costa rica}}, meaning "rich coast" in the Spanish language, was in some accounts first applied by [[Christopher Columbus]], who sailed to the eastern shores of Costa Rica during his final voyage in 1502,<ref name="embassy">{{cite web | title=About Costa Rica | work=Embassy of Costa Rica in Washington DC | url=http://www.costarica-embassy.org/index.php?q=node/19 | accessdate=18 September 2012 }}</ref> and reported vast quantities of gold jewelry worn by natives.<ref name="lp">{{cite web | title=History of Costa Rica | work=Lonely Planet | url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/costa-rica/history | accessdate=18 September 2012 }}</ref> The name may also have come from conquistador [[Gil González Dávila]], who landed on the west coast in 1522, encountered natives, and appropriated some of their gold.<ref name="dk">{{cite book |year=2010 | page=42 |title=DK Eyewitness Travel Guide: Costa Rica}}</ref>

[[File:Iglesia Inmaculada Concepcion Ujarras.jpg|thumb|The {{lang|es|[[Ujarrás]]|italic=no}} historical site in the Orosí Valley, [[Cartago province]]. The church was built between 1686 and 1693.]]
During most of the colonial period, Costa Rica was the southernmost province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], nominally part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. In practice, the captaincy general was a largely autonomous entity within the [[Spanish Empire]]. Costa Rica's distance from the capital of the captaincy in [[Guatemala]], its legal prohibition under Spanish law from trade with its southern neighbor Panama, then part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] (i.e. [[Colombia]]), and lack of resources such as gold and silver, made Costa Rica into a poor, isolated, and sparsely-inhabited region within the Spanish Empire.<ref>{{cite book | title= Claudia Quirós. La Era de la Encomienda. Historia de Costa Rica. Editorial de la Universidad de Costa Rica. 1990.}}</ref> Costa Rica was described as "the poorest and most miserable Spanish colony in all America" by a Spanish governor in 1719.<ref>{{cite book |author=Shafer, D. Michael |title=Winners and losers: how sectors shape the developmental prospects of states |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |year=1994|isbn=978-0-8014-8188-8}}</ref>

Another important factor behind Costa Rica's poverty was the lack of a significant indigenous population available for {{lang|es|[[encomienda]]}} (forced labor), which meant most of the Costa Rican settlers had to work on their own land, preventing the establishment of large {{lang|es|[[hacienda]]s}} (plantations). For all these reasons, Costa Rica was, by and large, unappreciated and overlooked by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Crown]] and left to develop on its own. The circumstances during this period are believed to have led to many of the idiosyncrasies for which Costa Rica has become known, while concomitantly setting the stage for Costa Rica's development as a more egalitarian society than the rest of its neighbors. Costa Rica became a "rural democracy" with no oppressed [[mestizo]] or indigenous class. It was not long before Spanish settlers turned to the hills, where they found rich volcanic soil and a milder climate than that of the lowlands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.costarica.com/Destinations/Cities-and-Towns/Cartago/ |title=Costa Rica – Cartago |publisher=Costarica.com |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

=== Independence ===
{{See also|Free State of Costa Rica|First Costa Rican Republic}}
Like the rest of [[Central America]], Costa Rica never fought for independence from Spain. On 15 September 1821, after the final Spanish defeat in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] (1810–21), the authorities in Guatemala declared the independence of all of Central America. That date is still celebrated as Independence Day in Costa Rica<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mep.go.cr/calendario/aniversario-independencia-nacional |title=Aniversario de la Independencia Nacional |website=Ministerio de Educación Pública |language=es |access-date=13 September 2018 }}</ref> even though, technically, under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] that had been readopted in 1820, [[Nicaragua]] and Costa Rica had become an autonomous province with its capital in [[León, Nicaragua|León]].

Upon independence, Costa Rican authorities faced the issue of officially deciding the future of the country. Two bands formed, the Imperialists, defended by [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] and [[Heredia Province|Heredia cities]] which were in favor of joining the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]], and the Republicans, represented by the cities of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]] and [[Alajuela]] who defended full independence. Because of the lack of agreement on these two possible outcomes, the first civil war of Costa Rica occurred. The [[Battle of Ochomogo]] took place on the Hill of Ochomogo, located in the [[Costa Rican Central Valley|Central Valley]] in 1823. The conflict was won by the Republicans and, as a consequence, the city of [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]] lost its status as the capital, which moved to [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Cartilla Histórica de Costa Rica|publisher = EUNED|year = 2005|isbn = 9789968313759|location = |pages = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = Apuntes para la historia de la ciudad de Alajuela|last = Alarmvogel|publisher = Impr.

[[File:First postal stamp CR 4 Reales 1863.jpg|thumb|The 1849 [[Coat of arms of Costa Rica|national coat of arms]] was featured in the first postal stamp issued in 1862.]]

In 1838, long after the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] ceased to function in practice, Costa Rica formally withdrew and proclaimed itself sovereign. The considerable distance and poor communication routes between [[Guatemala City]] and the Central Plateau, where most of the Costa Rican population lived then and still lives now, meant the local population had little allegiance to the federal government in Guatemala. From colonial times to now, Costa Rica's reluctance to become economically tied with the rest of Central America has been a major obstacle to efforts for greater regional integration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cotf.edu/earthinfo/camerica/caeco.html|title=Central America|website=www.cotf.edu}}</ref>

=== Economic growth in the 19th century ===

[[Coffee]] was first planted in Costa Rica in 1808,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.co.cr/costa-ricas-coffee-tradition/52303/|title=Costa Rica's Coffee Tradition - Costa Rica Star News|date=21 October 2016|publisher=}}</ref> and by the 1820s, it surpassed [[tobacco]], [[sugar]], and [[cacao bean|cacao]] as a primary [[export]].  Coffee production remained Costa Rica's principal source of wealth well into the 20th century, creating a wealthy class of growers, the so-called Coffee Barons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelcostarica.nu/coffee#history|title=Coffee of Costa Rica - el café|website=www.travelcostarica.nu}}</ref> The revenue helped to modernize the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.embassycrsg.com/history-of-coffee-in-costa-rica.html|title=History of Coffee in Costa Rica|website=Embajada de Costa Rica en Singapur}}</ref><ref name="cafeimports.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.cafeimports.com/origin_costarica|title=Cafe Imports - Costa Rica|first=Cafe|last=Imports|website=www.cafeimports.com}}</ref>

Most of the coffee exported was grown around the main centers of population in the Central Plateau and then transported by [[Bullock cart|oxcart]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] port of [[Puntarenas]] after the main road was built in 1846.<ref name="cafeimports.com"/> By the mid-1850s the main market for coffee was Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.anywhere.com/costa-rica/travel-guide/coffee|title=Costa Rica Coffee - Past & Present Coffee Cultivations|website=www.anywhere.com}}</ref> It soon became a high priority to develop an effective transportation route from the Central Plateau to the Atlantic Ocean. For this purpose, in the 1870s, the Costa Rican government contracted with U.S. businessman [[Minor C. Keith]] to build a railroad from San José to the [[Western Caribbean Zone|Caribbean]] port of [[Limón]]. Despite enormous difficulties with construction, disease, and financing, the railroad was completed in 1890.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l9QOAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA310|title=Coffee Production and Processing on a Large Costa Rican Finca|publisher=Bib. Orton IICA / CATIE|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Most Afro-Costa Ricans descend from [[Jamaica]]n immigrants who worked in the construction of that railway and now make up about 3% of Costa Rica's population.<ref>{{cite news| title= Blacks of Costa Rica |url =http://www.everyculture.com/Middle-America-Caribbean/Blacks-of-Costa-Rica.html | work =World Culture Encyclopedia | accessdate = 23 November 2007}}</ref> U.S. convicts, Italians and Chinese immigrants also participated in the construction project. In exchange for completing the railroad, the Costa Rican government granted Keith large tracts of land and a lease on the train route, which he used to produce bananas and export them to the United States. As a result, bananas came to rival coffee as the principal Costa Rican export, while foreign-owned corporations (including the [[United Fruit Company]] later) began to hold a major role in the national economy and eventually became a symbol of the exploitative export economy.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bUM8y5L1h8kC&pg=PA80&dq=costa+rica+history+united+fruit+company'#v=onepage&q=costa+rica+history+united+fruit+company'|title=The History of Costa Rica|first=Monica A.|last=Rankin|date=29 December 2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780313379444}}</ref> The major labor dispute between the peasants and the United Fruit Company (The Great Banana Strike) was a major event in the country's history and was an important step that would eventually lead to the formation of effective [[trade unions in Costa Rica]], as the company was required to sign a collective agreement with its workers in 1938.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YujmDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT135&dq=Great+Banana+strike+1934#v=onepage&q=Great+Banana+strike+1934|title=Bananas and Business: The United Fruit Company in Colombia, 1899-2000|first=Marcelo|last=Bucheli|date=1 February 2005|publisher=NYU Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780814769874}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aflY6uCO1DMC&pg=PA213&dq=Great+Banana+strike+1934+collective+agreement#v=onepage&q=Great+Banana+strike+1934+collective+agreement|title=Winners and Losers: How Sectors Shape the Developmental Prospects of States|first=D.

==== 20th century ====
{{See also|Reform State}}
Historically, Costa Rica has generally enjoyed greater peace and more consistent political stability than many of its fellow Latin American nations. Since the late 19th century, however, Costa Rica has experienced two significant periods of violence. In 1917–19, General [[Federico Tinoco Granados]] ruled as a military dictator until he was overthrown and forced into exile. The unpopularity of Tinoco's regime led, after he was overthrown, to a considerable decline in the size, wealth, and political influence of the Costa Rican military. In 1948, [[José Figueres Ferrer]] led an [[Costa Rican Civil War|armed uprising]] in the wake of a disputed presidential election between [[Rafael Ángel Calderón Guardia]] (who had been president between 1940 and 1944) and [[Otilio Ulate Blanco]].<ref>See [http://reachian.googlepages.com/seniorthesis2 Ian Holzhauer, "The Presidency of Calderón Guardia" (University of Florida History Thesis, 2004)]</ref> With more than 2,000 dead, the resulting 44-day [[Costa Rican Civil War]] was the bloodiest event in Costa Rica during the 20th century.

The victorious rebels formed a government junta that [[military of Costa Rica|abolished the military]] altogether, and oversaw the drafting of a new constitution by a democratically elected assembly.<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/opinion/07kristof.html The Happiest People]". The New York Times. 6 January 2010.</ref> Having enacted these reforms, the junta transferred power to Ulate on 8 November 1949. After the ''coup d'état'', Figueres became a national hero, winning the country's first democratic election under the new constitution [[Costa Rican general election, 1953|in 1953]]. Since then, Costa Rica has held 14 presidential elections, the latest [[Costa Rican general election, 2018|in 2018]].  With uninterrupted democracy dating back to at least 1948, the country is the region's most stable.

[[File:Costa Rica map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Costa Rica map of Köppen climate classification]]
[[File:Arenal Volcano as seen from Monteverde.jpg|thumb|[[Arenal Volcano]]]]
Costa Rica is located on the Central American [[isthmus]], lying between latitudes [[8th parallel north|8°]] and [[12th parallel north|12°N]], and longitudes [[82nd meridian west|82°]] and [[86th meridian west|86°W]]. It borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] (to the east) and the Pacific Ocean (to the west), with a total of {{convert|1290|km|mi}} of coastline, {{convert|212|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the Caribbean coast and {{convert|1016|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the Pacific. Costa Rica also borders [[Nicaragua]] to the north ({{convert|309|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}} of border) and [[Panama]] to the south-southeast ({{convert|330|km|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}} of border). In total, Costa Rica comprises {{convert|51100|km2|sqmi}} plus {{convert|589|km2|sqmi}} of [[territorial waters]].

The highest point in the country is [[Cerro Chirripó]], at {{convert|3819|m|ft}}; it is the fifth highest peak in Central America. The highest volcano in the country is the [[Irazú Volcano]] ({{convert|3431|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and the largest lake is [[Lake Arenal]]. There are 14 known volcanoes in Costa Rica, and six of them have been active in the last 75 years.<ref>[[List of volcanoes in Costa Rica]]</ref>  The country has also experienced at least ten earthquakes of magnitude 5.7 or higher (3 of magnitude 7.0 or higher) in the last century.

Costa Rica also comprises several islands. [[Cocos Island]] ({{convert|24|km2|sqmi|disp=or}}) stands out because of its distance from the continental landmass, {{convert|480|km|mi}} from [[Puntarenas]], but [[Isla Calero]] is the largest island of the country ({{convert|151.6|km2|sqmi|disp=or}}). Over 25% of Costa Rica's national territory is protected by [[SINAC]] (the National System of Conservation Areas), which oversees all of the country's [[List of Conservation Areas of Costa Rica|protected areas]]. Costa Rica also possesses the greatest density of species in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inbio.ac.cr/es/biod/estrategia/estudio.html |title=estudiofi |publisher=Inbio.ac.cr |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Because Costa Rica is located between 8 and 12 degrees north of the [[Equator]], the climate is [[Tropical climate|tropical]] year round. However, the country has many [[microclimate]]s depending on elevation, rainfall, topography, and by the geography of each particular region.

Costa Rica's seasons are defined by how much rain falls during a particular period. The year can be split into two periods, the dry season known to the residents as summer ({{lang|es|verano}}), and the rainy season, known locally as winter ({{lang|es|invierno}}). The "summer" or dry season goes from December to April, and "winter" or rainy season goes from May to November, which almost coincides with the [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|Atlantic hurricane season]], and during this time, it rains constantly in some regions.

The location receiving the most rain is the Caribbean slopes of the [[Cordillera Central (Costa Rica)|Cordillera Central]] mountains, with an annual rainfall of over {{convert|5000|mm|1|abbr=on}}. Humidity is also higher on the Caribbean side than on the Pacific side. The mean annual temperature on the coastal lowlands is around {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}}, {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the main populated areas of the Cordillera Central, and below {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} on the summits of the highest mountains.<ref>{{cite web |last=Eggar |first=Marc |title=Climate/Weather |url=http://www.worldheadquarters.com/cr/climate/ |accessdate=28 June 2011 }}</ref>

[[Tortuguero National Park]] – the name ''Tortuguero'' can be translated as "Full of Turtles" – is home to spider, howler, and white-throated capuchin monkeys; the [[three-toed sloth]] and [[two-toed sloth]]; 320 species of birds; and a variety of reptiles. The park is recognized for the annual nesting of the endangered [[green turtle]], and is the most important nesting site for the species. Giant [[leatherback turtle|leatherback]], [[hawksbill turtle|hawksbill]], and [[Loggerhead Sea Turtle|loggerhead]] turtles also nest there. The [[Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve]] is home to about 2,000 plant species,<ref name="karttv">{{cite web|url=http://www.govisitcostarica.com/region/city.asp?cID=402 |title=Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve |publisher=Govisitcostarica.com |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref> including numerous orchids. Over 400 types of birds and more than 100 species of mammals can be found there.<ref name="karttv"/>

Over 840 species of birds have been identified in Costa Rica. As is the case in much of Central America, the avian species in Costa Rica are a mix of North and South American species. The country's abundant fruit trees, many of which bear fruit year round, are hugely important to the birds, some of whom survive on diets that consist only of one or two types of fruit. Some of the country's most notable avian species include the [[resplendent quetzal]], [[scarlet macaw]], [[three-wattled bellbird]], [[bare-necked umbrellabird]], and the [[keel-billed toucan]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Stater|first=Adam|title=Birds of Costa Rica|url=http://www.anywherecostarica.com/flora-fauna/bird}}</ref> The [[Instituto Nacional de Biodiversidad]] is allowed to collect royalties on any biological discoveries of medical importance.

A 2017 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development warned that reducing the foreign debt must be a very high priority for the government. Other fiscal reforms were also recommended to moderate the budget deficit.<ref name="news.co.cr"/> The IMF also recommended debt reduction, with specific suggestions.<ref name="imf.org"/>

==== Liquidity crisis ====
In early August 2017, President [[Luis Guillermo Solís]] admitted that the country was facing a "liquidity crisis" and promised that a higher VAT tax and higher income tax rates were being considered by his government. Such steps are essential, Luis Guillermo Solís told the nation, because it was facing difficulties in paying its obligations and guaranteeing the provision of services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/hoy-san-diego/news/|title=Hoysd.com: News Hoy San Diego – San Diego Union Tribune|website=www.sandiegouniontribune.com}}</ref> Solís explained that the Treasury will prioritize payments on the public debt first, then salaries, and then pensions. The subsequent priorities include transfers to institutions "according to their social urgency". All other payments will be made only if funds are available.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

=== Trade and foreign investment ===
Costa Rica has free trade agreements with many countries, including the US. There are no significant trade barriers that would affect imports and the country has been lowering its tariffs in accordance with other Central American countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=Costa-Rica-Import-Tariffs|title=Costa Rica - Import Tariffs - export.gov|website=www.export.gov}}</ref> The country's Free Trade Zones provide incentives for manufacturing and service industries to operate in Costa Rica. In 2015, the zones supported over 82 thousand direct jobs and 43 thousand indirect jobs in 2015 and average wages in the FTZ were 1.8 times greater than the average for private enterprise work in the rest of the country.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> In 2016, [[Amazon.com]] for example, had some 3,500 employees in Costa Rica and planned to increase that by 1,500 in 2017, making it an important employer.<ref name="seattletimes.com"/>

The central  location provides access to American markets and direct ocean access to Europe and Asia. The most important exports in 2015 (in order of dollar value) were medical instruments, bananas, tropical fruits, integrated circuits and orthopedic appliances.<ref name="atlas.media.mit.edu">{{cite web|url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/cri/|title=OEC - Costa Rica (CRI) Exports, Imports, and Trade Partners|last=|first=|date=|website=atlas.media.mit.edu|access-date=}}</ref> Total imports in that year were US$15 billion. The most significant products imported in 2015 (in order of dollar value) were refined petroleum, automobiles, packaged medications, broadcasting equipment and computers. The total exports were US$12.6 billion for a trade deficit of US$2.39 billion in 2015.<ref name="atlas.media.mit.edu"/>

Pharmaceuticals, financial outsourcing, software development, and [[ecotourism]] have become the prime industries in Costa Rica's economy.

Costa Rica has developed a system of [[Payment for ecosystem services|payments for environmental services]].<ref name=ODI1/> Similarly, Costa Rica has a tax on water pollution to penalize businesses and homeowners that dump sewage, agricultural chemicals, and other pollutants into waterways.<ref>[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=331428&CategoryId=23558 "Costa Rica taxing firms that dump wastewater into rivers"], ''Latin American Herald Tribune'',  7 April 2007.</ref> In May 2007, the Costa Rican government announced its intentions to become 100% [[carbon neutral]] by 2021.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007549.html |title=Bright Green: Costa Rica and New Zealand on Path to Carbon Neutrality |work=Worldchanging |accessdate=5 May 2011 |date=7 November 2007 |first=Janet L. |last=Sawin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504015643/http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/007549.html |archivedate=4 May 2011 |df= }}</ref>  By 2015, 93 percent of the country's electricity came from [[Renewable energy in Costa Rica|renewable sources]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Costa Rica uses 100 pct. clean energy to generate power for over 90 days |work= EFE |publisher= Fox News Latino |date= 13 August 2015 |url= http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/08/13/costa-rica-uses-100-pct-clean-energy-to-generate-power-for-over-0-days/ |deadurl= bot: unknown |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150818071137/http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2015/08/13/costa-rica-uses-100-pct-clean-energy-to-generate-power-for-over-0-days/ |archivedate= 18 August 2015 |df=  }}</ref> In 2016, the country produced 98% of its electricity from renewable sources and ran completely on renewable sources for 110 continuous days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inhabitat.com/costa-rica-ran-almost-entirely-on-renewables-in-2016/|title=Costa Rica ran almost entirely on renewables in 2016|publisher=}}</ref>

In 1996, the Forest Law was enacted to provide direct financial incentives to landowners for the provision of environmental services.<ref name=ODI1/> This helped reorient the forestry sector away from commercial timber production and the resulting [[deforestation]], and helped create awareness of the services it provides for the economy and society (i.e., [[carbon fixation]], hydrological services such as producing fresh drinking water, biodiversity protection, and provision of scenic beauty).<ref name=ODI1/>

A 2016 report by the U.S. government report identifies other challenges facing Costa Rica as it works to expand its economy by working with companies from the US (and probably from other countries).<ref name="2016.export.gov"/> The major concerns identified were as follows:

* The ports, roads, railways and water delivery systems would benefit from major upgrading, a concern voiced by other reports too.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/a-bird-eye-view-of-costa-rica-s-transport-infrastructure_5jlswbwvwqjf-en|title=A bird-eye view of Costa Rica's transport infrastructure|first1=Mauro|last1=Pisu|first2=Federico|last2=Villalobos|date=3 August 2016|publisher=|journal=OECD Economics Department Working Papers|doi=10.1787/5jlswbwvwqjf-en}}</ref> Attempts by China to invest in upgrading such aspects were "stalled by bureaucratic and legal concerns".
* The bureaucracy is "often slow and cumbersome".

Costa Rica is an active member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Organization of American States]]. The [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]] and the [[United Nations University of Peace]] are based in Costa Rica. It is also a member of many other international organizations related to [[human rights]] and democracy, such as the [[Community of Democracies]]. A main foreign policy objective of Costa Rica is to foster human rights and sustainable development as a way to secure stability and growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rree.go.cr/?sec=ministerio&cat=politica%20exterior |title=Costa Rican Ministry of International Relations Declaration of Objectives |publisher=Costa Rican Ministry of International relations |accessdate=23 April 2011 |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20190307023820/https://www.rree.go.cr/?sec=ministerio&cat=politica%20exterior |archive-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>

Costa Rica is a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], without a [[Bilateral Immunity Agreement]] of protection for the [[United States military]] (as covered under [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Article 98]]). Costa Rica is an observer of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]].

On 10 September 1961, some months after [[Fidel Castro]] declared [[Cuba]] a socialist state, Costa Rican President [[Mario Echandi]] ended diplomatic relations with Cuba through ''Executive Decree Number 2''. This freeze lasted 47 years until President [[Óscar Arias|Óscar Arias Sánchez]] re-established normal relations on 18 March 2009, saying, "If we have been able to turn the page with regimes as profoundly different to our reality as occurred with the USSR or, more recently, with the Republic of China, how would we not do it with a country that is geographically and culturally much nearer to Costa Rica?" Arias announced that both countries would exchange ambassadors.<ref>[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-03-18/world/costa.rica.cuba.ties_1_costa-rica-president-oscar-arias-cuban-people?

On 14 July 2009, the [[International Court of Justice]] in the Hague upheld Costa Rica's navigation rights for commercial purposes to [[artisanal fishing|subsistence fishing]] on their side of the river. An 1858 treaty extended navigation rights to Costa Rica, but Nicaragua denied passenger travel and fishing were part of the deal; the court ruled Costa Ricans on the river were not required to have Nicaraguan tourist cards or visas as Nicaragua argued, but, in a nod to the Nicaraguans, ruled that Costa Rican boats and passengers must stop at the first and last Nicaraguan port along their route. They must also have an identity document or passport. Nicaragua can also impose timetables on Costa Rican traffic. Nicaragua may require Costa Rican boats to display the [[flag of Nicaragua]], but may not charge them for departure clearance from its ports. These were all specific items of contention brought to the court in the 2005 filing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/legal-services-litigation/12579933-1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511230540/http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/legal-services-litigation/12579933-1.html |archivedate=11 May 2011 |title=World Court Settles San Juan River Dispute; Nicaragua and Costa Rica Both Claim Victory |publisher=Allbusiness.com|date=16 July 2009 |accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref>

The [[Costa Rica 2011 Census|2011 census]] counted a population of 4.3 million people<ref>{{cite web|url=https://costaricalaw.com/costa-rica-facts/demographics-and-population/population-statistics/|title=Costa Rica Population Statistics - CostaRicaLaw.com|date=30 September 2016|publisher=}}</ref> distributed among the following groups: 83.6% whites or [[mestizo]]s, 6.7% [[mulatto]]es, 2.4% [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], 1.1% black or [[Afro-Costa Rican|Afro-Caribbean]]; the census showed 1.1% as Other, 2.9% (141,304 people) as None, and 2.2% (107,196 people) as unspecified.<ref name="livepopulation.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.livepopulation.com/country/costa-rica.html|title=Live Costa Rica Population Clock 2017 - Population of Costa Rica Today|website=www.livepopulation.com}}</ref> By 2016, the UN estimation for the population was around {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Costa Rica}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}}
[[File:Bevölkerungspyramide Costa Rica 2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid 2016]]
In 2011, there were over 104,000 Native American or indigenous inhabitants, representing 2.4% of the population. Most of them live in secluded reservations, distributed among eight ethnic groups: [[Quitirrisí]] (in the Central Valley), Matambú or [[Chorotega people|Chorotega]] (Guanacaste), [[Maleku people|Maleku]] (northern Alajuela), [[Bribri people|Bribri]] (southern Atlantic), [[Cabécar people|Cabécar]] (Cordillera de Talamanca), [[Guaymí]] (southern Costa Rica, along the Panamá border), [[Boruca people|Boruca]] (southern Costa Rica) and {{Ill|Térraba people|es|Térraba|lt=Térraba}} (southern Costa Rica).

The population includes [[European Costa Ricans]] (of European ancestry), primarily of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent,<ref name=CIA/> with significant numbers of Italian, German, English, Dutch, French, Irish, Portuguese, and Polish families, as well a sizable Jewish community. The majority of the Afro-Costa Ricans are [[Creole English]]-speaking descendants of 19th century black [[Jamaicans|Jamaican]] immigrant workers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schulman |first=Bob | title='Little Jamaica' Rocks on the Caribbean Coast of Costa Rica |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/little-jamaica-rocks-on-t_b_8100114 |work=Huffington Post|access-date=22 January 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Koch |first=Charles W. |title=JAMAICAN BLACKS AND THEIR DESCENDANTS IN COSTA RICA |journal=Social and Economic Studies |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=339–361 |location=Jamaica |publisher=Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies, University of the West Indies |jstor=27861669 |year=1977 }}</ref>

[[File:Niños costarricenses.JPG|thumb|Costa Rican school children]]
The 2011 census classified 83.6% of the population as white or [[Mestizo]]; the latter are persons of combined European and Amerindian descent. The [[Mulatto]] segment (mix of white and black) represented 6.7% and indigenous people made up 2.4% of the population.<ref name=CIA/> Native and European mixed blood populations are far less than in other Latin American countries. Exceptions are [[Guanacaste Province|Guanacaste]], where almost half the population is visibly mestizo, a legacy of the more pervasive unions between Spanish colonists and Chorotega Amerindians through several generations, and [[Limón]], where the vast majority of the Afro-Costa Rican community lives.

Costa Rica hosts many refugees, mainly from [[Colombia]] and [[Nicaragua]].

[[Christianity]] is Costa Rica's predominant religion, with [[Roman Catholicism]] being the official [[state religion]] according to the 1949 Constitution, which at the same time guarantees [[freedom of religion]]. It is the only state in the [[Americas]] which established Roman Catholicism as its state religion; other such countries are microstates in Europe: [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], the [[Vatican City]] and [[Malta]].

The Latinobarómetro survey of 2017 found that 57% of the population identify themselves as [[Roman Catholics]], 25% are [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] [[Protestants]], 15% report that they [[Nonreligious|do not have a religion]], and 2% declare that they belong to another religion.<ref name="latbar" /> This survey indicated a decline in the share of Catholics and rise in the share of Protestants and irreligious.<ref name="latbar"/> The rate of secularism is high by Latin American standards.

Due to small, but continuous, immigration from Asia and the Middle East, other religions have grown, the most popular being [[Buddhism]], with about 100,000 practitioners (over 2% of the population).<ref name="buddhistchannel.tv"/> Most Buddhists are members of the [[Han Chinese]] community of about 40,000 with some new local converts. There is also a small [[Islam in Costa Rica|Muslim]] community of about 500 families, or 0.001% of the population.<ref>{{cite news|title=Navidad se vive diferente en hogares ticos no cristianos|first=Adriana|last=Quirós|language=Spanish|newspaper=La Nación|date=24 December 2010|url=http://www.nacion.com/2010-12-25/AldeaGlobal/FotoVideoDestacado/AldeaGlobal2626179.aspx|trans-title=Christmas is lived differently in non-Christian Costa Rican homes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101228232240/http://www.nacion.com/2010-12-25/AldeaGlobal/FotoVideoDestacado/AldeaGlobal2626179.aspx|archivedate=28 December 2010|df=}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of Costa Rica}}
The primary language spoken in Costa Rica is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], which features characteristics [[Costa Rican Spanish|distinct to the country]], a form of Central American Spanish. Costa Rica is a linguistically diverse country and home to at least five living local indigenous languages spoken by the descendants of pre-Columbian peoples: Maléku, Cabécar, Bribri, Guaymí, and Buglere.

Of native languages still spoken, primarily in indigenous reservations, the most numerically important are the [[Bribri language|Bribri]], [[Maléku language|Maléku]], [[Cabécar language|Cabécar]] and [[Ngäbere language]]s; some of these have several thousand speakers in Costa Rica while others have a few hundred. Some languages, such as [[Teribe language|Teribe]] and [[Boruca language|Boruca]], have fewer than a thousand speakers. The Buglere language and the closely related Guaymí are spoken by some in southeast Puntarenas.<ref name="worldatlas.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/articles/what-languages-are-spoken-in-costa-rica.html|title=What Languages Are Spoken In Costa Rica?|publisher=}}</ref>

A [[English-based creole language|Creole-English]] language, [[Jamaican Patois|Jamaican ''patois'']] (also known as [[Limonese Creole|Mekatelyu]]), is an English-based Creole language spoken by the Afro-Carib immigrants who have settled primarily in Limón Province along the Caribbean coast.<ref name="worldatlas.com"/>

About 10.7% of Costa Rica's adult population (18 or older) also speaks English, 0.7% French, and 0.3% speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or German as a second language.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2008/marzo/11/pais1457622.html|title=Solo 1 de cada 10 adultos habla un segundo idioma|publisher=[[La Nación (Costa Rica)]]|author=Jairo Villegas|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=22 July 2010}}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of Costa Rica}}
Costa Rica was the point where the [[Mesoamerican]] and South American native cultures met. The northwest of the country, the Nicoya peninsula, was the southernmost point of [[Nahuatl]] cultural influence when the Spanish conquerors ([[conquistadores]]) came in the 16th century. The central and southern portions of the country had [[Chibcha]] influences. The Atlantic coast, meanwhile, was populated with African workers during the 17th and 18th centuries.

As a result of the immigration of Spaniards, their 16th-century Spanish culture and its evolution marked everyday life and culture until today, with Spanish language and the Catholic religion as primary influences.

The Department of Culture, Youth, and Sports is in charge of the promotion and coordination of cultural life. The work of the department is divided into Direction of Culture, Visual Arts, Scenic Arts, Music, Patrimony and the System of Libraries. Permanent programs, such as the National Symphony Orchestra of Costa Rica and the Youth Symphony Orchestra, are conjunctions of two areas of work: Culture and Youth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Dance-oriented genres, such as ''[[Soca music|soca]]'', ''[[Salsa music|salsa]]'', ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', ''[[Merengue music|merengue]]'', ''[[cumbia]]'' and Costa Rican swing are enjoyed increasingly by older rather than younger people. The guitar is popular, especially as an accompaniment to folk dances; however, the marimba was made the national instrument.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Further|Costa Rican cuisine}}
Costa Rican cuisine is a blend of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], Spanish, African and many other cuisine origins. Dishes such as the very traditional [[Tamal (dish)|tamale]] and many others made of corn are the most representative of its indigenous inhabitants, and similar to other neighboring Mesoamerican countries. Spaniards brought many new ingredients to the country from other lands, especially spices and domestic animals. And later in the 19th century, the African flavor lent its presence with influence from other Caribbean mixed flavors. This is how Costa Rican cuisine today is very varied, with every new ethnic group who had recently become part of the country's population influencing the country's cuisine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southerncostarica.biz/General/cat-others/Costarican-Typical-Food/179/ |title=Costa Rican Typical Food |publisher=Southerncostarica.biz |accessdate=2 November 2011}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2011}}

But since the 1941 creation of the Social Insurance Administration (''Caja Costarricense de Seguro Social'' – CCSS), Costa Rica has provided [[universal health care]] to its wage-earning residents, with coverage extended to dependants over time. In 1973, the CCSS took over administration of all 29 of the country's public hospitals and all health care, also launching a Rural Health Program (''Programa de Salud Rural'') for primary care to rural areas, later extended to primary care services nationwide. In 1993, laws were passed to enable elected health boards that represented health consumers, social insurance representatives, employers, and social organizations. By the year 2000, social health insurance coverage was available to 82% of the Costa Rican population. Each health committee manages an area equivalent to one of the 83 administrative cantons of Costa Rica. There is limited use of private, for-profit services (around 14.4% of the national total health expenditure). About 7% of GDP is allocated to the health sector, and over 70% is government funded.

Primary health care facilities in Costa Rica include health clinics, with a [[general practitioner]], nurse, clerk, pharmacist and a primary health technician<!---, around one per two population--- Clarify?---->.

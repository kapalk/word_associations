==Etymology==
The earliest known record of the name "Belize" appears in the journal of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest Fray José Delgado, dating to 1677.<ref name="Twigg">{{cite book|last= Twigg|first= Alan|title= Understanding Belize: A Historical Guide|year= 2006|publisher= Harbour Publishing|location= Madeira Park, BC|isbn= 978-1550173253|pages= 9–10, 38–45}}</ref> Delgado recorded the names of three major rivers that he crossed while travelling north along the Caribbean coast: Rio Soyte, Rio Xibum and Rio Balis. The names of these waterways, which correspond to the [[Sittee River]], [[Sibun River]] and [[Belize River]], were provided to Delgado by his translator.<ref name="Twigg"/> It is likely that Delgado's "Balis" was actually the Mayan word ''belix'' (or ''beliz''), meaning "muddy-watered".<ref name="Twigg"/>

Some have suggested that the name derives from a Spanish pronunciation of the name of the Scottish buccaneer [[Peter Wallace (buccaneer)|Peter Wallace]], who established a settlement at the mouth of the Belize River in 1638.<ref name="brit1893">{{cite encyclopedia |year= 1892 |title= British Honduras |encyclopedia= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |volume= 12 |location= New York |publisher= The Britannica Publishing Company |url= https://books.google.com/?id=uGRJAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA133 |accessdate= 25 October 2010}}</ref> There is no proof that Wallace settled in this area and some scholars have characterized this claim as a myth.<ref name="Twigg"/> Writers and historians have suggested several other possible etymologies, including postulated French and African origins.<ref name="Twigg"/>

==History==
{{Main|History of Belize}}

===Early history===

[[File:Mayamap.png|right|thumb|Extent of the Maya civilization]]
The [[Maya civilization]] emerged at least three millennia ago in the lowland area of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] and the highlands to the south, in the area of present-day southeastern [[Mexico]], Belize, [[Guatemala]], and western [[Honduras]]. Many aspects of this culture persist in the area despite nearly 500 years of European domination. Prior to about 2500 BC, some [[hunter-gatherer|hunting and foraging]] bands settled in small farming villages; they later domesticated crops such as corn, beans, [[Squash (plant)|squash]], and chili peppers.

A profusion of languages and subcultures developed within the Maya core culture. Between about 2500 BC and 250 AD, the basic institutions of Maya civilization emerged. The peak of this civilization occurred during the classic period, which began about 250 AD.<ref name=cs>

===Maya civilization===
{{Main|Pre-Columbian Belize}}
The [[Maya civilization]] spread across what is now Belize around 1500 {{small|BC}}, and flourished there until about {{small|AD}} 900. The recorded history of the middle and southern regions is dominated by [[Caracol]], an urban political centre that may have supported over 140,000 people.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Houston, Stephen D. |authorlink=Stephen D.

When Spanish explorers arrived in the 16th century, the area that is now Belize included three distinct Maya territories: [[Chetumal province]], which encompassed the area around [[Corozal Bay]]; [[Dzuluinicob province]], which encompassed the area between the [[New River (Belize)|New River]] and the [[Sibun River]], west to [[Tipu, Belize|Tipu]]; and a southern territory controlled by the [[Manche Ch'ol]] Maya, encompassing the area between the [[Monkey River]] and the [[Sarstoon River]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Shoman|first=Assad|title=Thirteen chapters of a history of Belize|year=1995|publisher=Angelus Press|location=Belize City, Belize|isbn=978-9768052193|pages=5–6}}</ref>

===Early colonial period (1506–1862)===
{{Further|History of Belize (1506–1862)|Colony of Jamaica}}

Spanish [[conquistador]]s explored the land and declared it a [[Spanish colony]] but chose not to settle and develop because of its lack of resources and the hostile Indian tribes of the Yucatán.

English and Scottish settlers and pirates known as the [[Baymen]] entered the area from the 17th century, with Baymen first settling on the coast of what is now Belize in 1638, seeking a sheltered region from which they could attack Spanish ships ''(see [[English settlement in Belize]])''. The settlers established a trade colony and [[port]] in what became the [[Belize District]],<ref name="Johnson2003"/> and during the 18th century, established a system using [[Atlantic slave trade|black slaves]] to cut [[logwood]] (''Haematoxylum campechianum'') trees. This yielded a valuable fixing agent for clothing dyes,<ref>{{cite book|last=Hofenk de Graff|first=Judith H.|title=The Colourful Past: Origins, Chemistry and Identification of Natural Dyestuffs|date=2004|publisher=Archetype Books|location=London|isbn=978-1873132135|page=235}}</ref> and was one of the first ways to achieve a [[Natural dye#The rise of formal black|fast black]] before the advent of artificial dyes. The Spanish granted the British settlers the right to occupy the area and cut logwood in exchange for their help suppressing piracy.<ref name="cs"/>

[[File:St. George's Cay Day Official Holiday.jpg|thumb|An excerpt from the 1898 Gazette that declared 10 September an official holiday, part of the efforts of the Centennial Committee]]

The British first appointed a superintendent over the Belize area in 1786. Before then the British government had not recognized the settlement as a colony for fear of provoking a [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] attack. The delay in government oversight allowed the settlers to establish their own laws and forms of government. During this period, a few successful settlers gained control of the local legislature, known as the Public Meeting, as well as of most of the settlement's land and timber.

The [[Battle of St. George's Caye]] was a 1798 military engagement off the coast of Belize between an invading Spanish fleet and a small force of [[Baymen]] and their slaves. From 3 to 5 September, the Spaniards tried to force their way through Montego Caye shoal, but were blocked by defenders. Spain's last attempt occurred on 10 September, when the Baymen repelled the Spanish fleet in a short engagement with no known casualties on either side. The anniversary of the battle is a national holiday in Belize and is celebrated to commemorate the "first Belizeans" and the defence of their territory.<ref>{{cite web|last=Swift|first=Keith|title=St. George's Caye Declared a Historic Site|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=14922|publisher=News 7 Belize|date=1 September 2009}}</ref>

===As part of the British Empire (1862–1981)===
{{Main|British Honduras}}

In the early 19th century, the British sought to reform the settlers, threatening to suspend the Public Meeting unless it observed the government's instructions to eliminate slavery outright. After a generation of wrangling, slavery was [[Slavery Abolition Act 1833|abolished]] in the [[British Empire]] in 1833.<ref>{{cite web|title=3° & 4° Gulielmi IV, cap. LXXIII An Act for the Abolition of Slavery throughout the British Colonies; for promoting the Industry of the manumitted Slaves; and for compensating the Persons hitherto entitled to the Services of such Slaves.|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Legis_07.htm|accessdate=14 August 2015}}</ref> As a result of their slaves' abilities in the work of [[mahogany]] extraction, owners in [[British Honduras]] were compensated at £53.69 per slave on average, the highest amount paid in any British territory.<ref name="Johnson2003">{{cite journal |last=Johnson |first=Melissa A. |title=The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras |journal=Environmental History |volume=8 |date=October 2003 |pages=598–617 |jstor=3985885 |issue=4 |doi=10.2307/3985885|hdl=11214/203 }}</ref>

However, the end of slavery did little to change the former slaves' working conditions if they stayed at their trade. A series of institutions restricted the ability of individuals to buy land, in a debt-peonage system. Former "extra special" mahogany or logwood cutters undergirded the early ascriptions of the capacities (and consequently the limitations) of people of African descent in the colony. Because a small elite controlled the settlement's land and commerce, former slaves had little choice but to continue to work in timber cutting.<ref name="Johnson2003" />

In 1836, after the [[Spanish American wars of independence|emancipation of Central America from Spanish rule]], the British claimed the right to administer the region. In 1862, Great Britain formally declared it a [[British Crown Colony]], subordinate to Jamaica, and named it British Honduras.<ref>{{cite book|author=Greenspan, |title=Frommer's Belize|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AneYREkUJecC&pg=PA279|accessdate=15 August 2012|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-92261-2|pages=279–}}</ref>

As a colony, Belize began to attract British investors. Among the British firms that dominated the colony in the late 19th century was the Belize Estate and Produce Company, which eventually acquired half of all privately held land and eventually eliminated peonage. Belize Estate's influence accounts in part for the colony's reliance on the mahogany trade throughout the rest of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.
{{wide image|British Honduras 1914.jpg|2000px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of Belize City, c. 1914}}

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s caused a near-collapse of the colony's economy as British demand for timber plummeted. The effects of widespread unemployment were worsened by a [[1931 Belize hurricane|devastating hurricane]] that struck the colony in 1931. Perceptions of the government's relief effort as inadequate were aggravated by its refusal to legalize labour unions or introduce a minimum wage. Economic conditions improved during [[World War II]] as many Belizean men entered the armed forces or otherwise contributed to the war effort.

Following the war, the colony's economy stagnated. Britain's decision to [[devalue]] the British Honduras dollar in 1949 worsened economic conditions and led to the creation of the People's Committee, which demanded independence. The People's Committee's successor, the [[People's United Party]] (PUP), sought constitutional reforms that expanded voting rights to all adults. The first election under [[universal suffrage]] was held [[British Honduras general election, 1954|in 1954]] and was decisively won by the PUP, beginning a three-decade period in which the PUP dominated the country's politics. Pro-independence activist [[George Cadle Price]] became PUP leader in 1956 and the effective head of government in 1961, a post he would hold under various titles until 1984.

Under a new constitution Britain granted British Honduras self-government in 1964. On 1 June 1973, British Honduras was officially renamed Belize.<ref name="caricom">[http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/belize.jsp CARICOM – Member Country Profile – BELIZE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319161604/http://www.caricom.org/jsp/community/belize.jsp |date=19 March 2015 }}, [[Caribbean Community]]. (accessed 23 June 2015)</ref> Progress toward independence, however, was hampered by a [[Belizean–Guatemalan territorial dispute|Guatemalan claim to sovereignty over Belizean territory]].

===Independent Belize (since 1981)===

Belize was granted independence on 21 September 1981. [[Guatemala]] refused to recognize the new nation because of its longstanding territorial dispute with the British colony, claiming that Belize belonged to Guatemala. About 1,500 British troops remained in Belize to deter any possible incursions.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Merrill|editor1-first=Tim|title=Belize: A Country Study|date=1992|publisher=GPO for the Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/belize/87.htm|chapter=Relations with Britain}}</ref>

With Price at the helm, the PUP won all national elections [[Belizean general election, 1984|until 1984]]. In that election, the first national election after independence, the PUP was defeated by the [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]] (UDP). UDP leader [[Manuel Esquivel]] replaced Price as prime minister, with Price himself unexpectedly losing his own [[House of Representatives (Belize)|House]] seat to a UDP challenger. The PUP under Price returned to power after elections [[Belizean general election, 1989|in 1989]]. The following year the United Kingdom announced that it would end its military involvement in Belize, and the RAF Harrier detachment was withdrawn the same year, having remained stationed in the country continuously since its deployment had become permanent there in 1980. British soldiers were withdrawn in 1994, but the United Kingdom left behind a military training unit to assist with the newly created [[Belize Defence Force]].

The UDP regained power in the [[Belizean general election, 1993|1993 national election]], and Esquivel became prime minister for a second time. Soon afterwards, Esquivel announced the suspension of a pact reached with Guatemala during Price's tenure, claiming Price had made too many concessions to gain Guatemalan recognition. The pact may have curtailed the 130-year-old border dispute between the two countries. Border tensions continued into the early 2000s, although the two countries cooperated in other areas.

The PUP won a landslide victory in the 1998 national elections, and PUP leader [[Said Musa]] was sworn in as prime minister. In the 2003 elections the PUP maintained its majority, and Musa continued as prime minister. He pledged to improve conditions in the underdeveloped and largely inaccessible southern part of Belize.

In 2005, Belize was the site of [[2005 Belize unrest|unrest]] caused by discontent with the PUP government, including tax increases in the national budget. On 8 February 2008, [[Dean Barrow]] was sworn in as prime minister after his [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|UDP]] won [[Belizean general election, 2008|a landslide victory]] in general elections. Barrow and the UDP were re-elected [[Belizean general and local elections, 2012|in 2012]] with a considerably smaller majority. Barrow led the UDP to a third consecutive general election victory in November 2015, increasing the party's number of seats from 17 to 19. However he stated the election would be his last as party leader and preparations are under way for the party to elect his successor.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Belize}}{{see also|Government of Belize}}<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->
Belize is a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]]. The structure of government is based on the British parliamentary system, and the legal system is modelled on the [[English law#Common law|common law of England]]. The symbolic head of state is [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], who holds the title [[Monarchy of Belize|Queen of Belize]]. The Queen lives in the [[United Kingdom]], and is represented in Belize by the [[Governor-General of Belize|Governor-General]]. Executive authority is exercised by the cabinet, which advises the Governor-General and is led by the [[Prime Minister of Belize]], who is head of government. Cabinet ministers are members of the majority political party in parliament and usually hold elected seats within it concurrent with their cabinet positions.

The bicameral [[National Assembly of Belize]] comprises a [[House of Representatives of Belize|House of Representatives]] and a [[Senate of Belize|Senate]]. The 31 members of the House are popularly elected to a maximum five-year term and introduce legislation affecting the development of Belize. The Governor-General appoints the 12 members of the Senate, with a Senate president selected by the members. The Senate is responsible for debating and approving bills passed by the House.

[[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Parliament of Belize]]. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belize 1981 (rev. 2001)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Belize_2001?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=30 March 2015}}</ref>

Members of the independent judiciary are appointed. The judicial system includes local magistrates grouped under the Magistrates' Court, which hears less serious cases. The [[Supreme Court of Belize|Supreme Court]] (Chief Justice) hears murder and similarly serious cases, and the Court of Appeal hears appeals from convicted individuals seeking to have their sentences overturned. Defendants may, under certain circumstances, appeal their cases to the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]].

=== Political culture ===
Since 1974, the party system in Belize has been dominated by the centre-left [[People's United Party]] and the centre-right [[United Democratic Party (Belize)|United Democratic Party]], although other small parties took part in all levels of elections in the past. Though none of these small political parties has ever won any significant number of seats and/or offices, their challenge has been growing over the years.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Belize}}
Belize is a full participating member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA), [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME), [[Association of Caribbean States]] (ACS),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.barbadosbusiness.gov.bb/miib/Barbados/regional_links.cfm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060228195122/http://www.barbadosbusiness.gov.bb/miib/Barbados/regional_links.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 February 2006 |title=The Barbados government's Regional and International affiliations |accessdate=1 June 2016}}. BarbadosBusiness.gov.bb</ref> and the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ), which currently serves as a final court of appeal for only [[Barbados]], Belize, and [[Guyana]]. In 2001 the Caribbean Community heads of government voted on a measure declaring that the region should work towards replacing the UK's [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] with the Caribbean Court of Justice. It is still in the process of acceding to CARICOM and SICA treaties, including trade and single market treaties.

Belize is an original member (1995) of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and participates actively in its work. The pact involves the Caribbean Forum ([[CARIFORUM]]) subgroup of the [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|Group of African, Caribbean, and Pacific states]] (ACP). CARIFORUM presently the only part of the wider ACP-bloc that has concluded the full regional trade-pact with the [[European Union]].

The [[Belize Defence Force]] (BDF) serves as the country's military and is responsible for protecting the sovereignty of Belize. The BDF, with the Belize National Coast Guard and the Immigration Department, is a department of the Ministry of Defence and Immigration. In 1997 the regular army numbered over 900, the reserve army 381, the air wing 45 and the maritime wing 36, amounting to an overall strength of approximately 1400.<ref name="cavehill.uwi.edu">{{cite web|url=http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/belize/conference/papers/phillips.html|first=Dion E.|last=Phillips|title=The Military of Belize|date=2002|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121211184053/http://www.cavehill.uwi.edu/bnccde/belize/conference/papers/phillips.html|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2005, the maritime wing became part of the Belizean Coast Guard.<ref name="ra_20071213">"Channel 5 Belize" (28 November 2005),{{cite web|url=http://www.channel5belize.com/archive_detail_story.php?story_id=15230 |title=Belizean Coast Guard hits the high seas |accessdate=26 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504030931/http://www.channel5belize.com/archive_detail_story.php?story_id=15230 |archivedate=4 May 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In 2012, the Belizean government spent about $17 million on the military, constituting 1.08% of the country's [[gross domestic product]] (GDP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Belize |website=CIA World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513185850/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html |archivedate=13 May 2013 |df= }}</ref>

After Belize achieved independence in 1981 the United Kingdom maintained a deterrent force (British Forces Belize) in the country to protect it from invasion by [[Guatemala]] (see [[Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory]]). During the 1980s this included a battalion and [[No. 1417 Flight RAF]] of Harriers. The main British force left in 1994, three years after Guatemala recognized Belizean independence, but the United Kingdom maintained a training presence via the British Army Training and Support Unit Belize (BATSUB) and [[25 Flight AAC]] until 2011 when the last British Forces left Ladyville Barracks, with the exception of seconded advisers.<ref name="cavehill.uwi.edu" />

=== Administrative divisions ===
[[File:Belize, administrative divisions - en - monochrome.svg|right|thumb|Districts of Belize]]
Belize is divided into [[Districts of Belize|six districts]].
{{#section:Districts of Belize|list}}

These districts are further divided into [[Constituencies of Belize|31 constituencies]]. [[Local government in Belize]] comprises four types of local authorities: [[city council]]s, [[town council]]s, [[Town council|village councils]] and [[community council]]s. The two city councils ([[Belize City]] and [[Belmopan]]) and seven town councils cover the urban population of the country, while village and community councils cover the rural population.<ref name="belgov">{{cite web |url=http://www.belize.gov.bz/ct.asp?xItem=705&ctNode=568&mp=27 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110720103724/http://www.belize.gov.bz/ct.asp?xItem=705&ctNode=568&mp=27 |archive-date=20 July 2011 |title=Local Government |dead-url=yes |accessdate=1 June 2016}}.

===Guatemalan territorial dispute=== 
[[File:Disputed territory between Belize and Guatemala.svg|thumb|Guatemala's territorial claim on Belize]]
Throughout Belize's history, Guatemala has [[Belizean–Guatemalan territorial dispute|claimed ownership]] of all or part of Belizean territory. This claim is occasionally reflected in maps drawn by Guatemala's government, showing Belize as Guatemala's [[Departments of Guatemala|twenty-third department]]. {{As of|2016}}, the border dispute with Guatemala remains unresolved and quite contentious.<ref name="cia22">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html|title=Belize|work=CIA World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513185850/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bh.html|archivedate=13 May 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=13 January 2016|df=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36114383|title=Belize-Guatemala border tensions rise over shooting – BBC News|date=22 April 2016|work=BBC News|accessdate=11 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/47/185.html|title=ACP-EU summit 2000|publisher=Hartford-hwp.com|accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref> Guatemala's claim to Belizean territory rests, in part, on Clause VII of the [[Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty of 1859]], which obligated the British to build a road between Belize City and Guatemala. At various times, the issue has required mediation by the United Kingdom, [[Caribbean Community]] heads of government, the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS), Mexico, and the United States. However, on April 15, 2018, Guatemala's government held a referendum to determine if the country should take its [[Belizean–Guatemalan territorial dispute|territorial claim on Belize]] to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) to settle the long-standing issue. Guatemalans voted yes on the matter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/ibru/news/boundary_news/?itemno=34541|title=Belize to hold a referendum on Guatemala territorial dispute - Durham University|website=www.dur.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref> A similar referendum will be held in Belize on April 10, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://belizereferendum.gov.bz/|title=Home - Belize Referrendum|last=|first=|date=|website=bit.ly|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-23}}</ref>

The Guatemalan territorial claim involves approximately 53% of Belize's mainland, which includes significant portions of four Belizean districts: Belize, Cayo, Stann Creek, and Toledo.<sup>[[Belize#cite%20note-38|[37]]]</sup> Roughly 43% of its population (≈154,949 Belizeans) resides in this region.<sup>[[Belize#cite%20note-39|[38]]]</sup>

===Indigenous land claims===
Belize backed the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples|United Nations (UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] in 2007, which established legal land rights to indigenous groups.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/full-participation-belizes-indigenous-people-crucial-achieving-sustainable-development-goals|title=The Full Participation of Belize's Indigenous People is Crucial to Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en}}</ref> Other court cases have affirmed these rights like the [[Supreme Court of Belize]]'s 2013 decision to uphold its ruling in 2010 that acknowledges customary land titles as communal land for indigenous peoples.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://rightsandresources.org/en/blog/historic-legal-victory-for-indigenous-peoples-in-belize/|title=Historic Legal Victory for Indigenous Peoples in Belize {{!}} Rights + Resources|last=|first=|date=|work=Rights + Resources|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref> Another such case is the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]]'s (CCJ) 2015 order on the Belizean government, which stipulated that the country develop a land registry to classify and exercise traditional governance over Mayan lands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/08/09/satiim-launches-maya-lands-registry-celebrate-indigenous-peoples-day/|title=SATIIM launches Maya lands registry to celebrate UN Indigenous Peoples day|last=|first=|date=2017-08-09|work=Breaking Belize News-The Leading Online News Source of Belize|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}</ref> Despite these rulings, Belize has made little progress to support the land rights of indigenous communities; for instance, in the two years since the CCJ's decision, Belize's government has been stagnant to launch the Mayan land registry, rendering the group to take action into its own hands.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.breakingbelizenews.com/2017/08/09/satiim-launches-maya-lands-registry-celebrate-indigenous-peoples-day/|title=SATIIM launches Maya lands registry to celebrate UN Indigenous Peoples day|date=2017-08-09|work=Breaking Belize News-The Leading Online News Source of Belize|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://rightsandresources.org/en/blog/historic-legal-victory-for-indigenous-peoples-in-belize/|title=Historic Legal Victory for Indigenous Peoples in Belize {{!}} Rights + Resources|work=Rights + Resources|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref>

The exact ramifications of these cases need to be examined. {{as of|2017}}, Belize still struggles to recognize indigenous populations and their respective rights. According to the 50-page voluntary national report Belize created on its progress toward the [[Sustainable Development Goals|UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals]], indigenous groups are not factored into the country's indicators whatsoever.<ref>https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/16389Belize.pdf</ref> In fact, the groups 'Creole' and 'Garinagu' are not included in the document, and 'Maya' and 'Mestizo' only occur once throughout the entirety of the report.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.culturalsurvival.org/news/full-participation-belizes-indigenous-people-crucial-achieving-sustainable-development-goals|title=The Full Participation of Belize's Indigenous People is Crucial to Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en}}</ref> It is yet to be seen if the Belizean government will highlight the consequences of the territorial claim on indigenous land rights prior to the referendum vote in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://belizereferendum.gov.bz/dispute/about|title=About The Dispute - Belize Referrendum|website=belizereferendum.gov.bz|access-date=2018-10-24}}</ref>

Belize is on the Caribbean coast of northern Central America. It shares a border on the north with the Mexican state of [[Quintana Roo]], on the west with the Guatemalan department of [[Petén (department)|Petén]], and on the south with the Guatemalan department of [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To the east in the Caribbean Sea, [[Belize Barrier Reef|the second-longest barrier reef]] in the world flanks much of the {{convert|386|km|mi|order=flip}} of predominantly [[marsh]]y coastline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.know-belize.com/travel/|title=Move to Belize Guide|website=Belize Travel Guide|date=March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021110627/http://www.know-belize.com/travel/|archivedate=21 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The area of the country totals {{convert|22960|km2|sqmi|order=flip|0}}, an area slightly larger than El Salvador, Israel, [[New Jersey]] or Wales. The many [[lagoon]]<nowiki/>s along the coasts and in the northern interior reduces the actual land area to {{convert|21400|km2|sqmi|order=flip|0}}.

Belize is shaped like a rectangle that extends about {{convert|280|km|mi|0|order=flip}} north-south and about {{convert|100|km|mi|order=flip}} east-west, with a total land boundary length of {{convert|516|km|mi|0|order=flip}}. The undulating courses of two rivers, the [[Rio Hondo (Belize)|Hondo]] and the [[Sarstoon River]], define much of the course of the country's northern and southern boundaries. The western border follows no natural features and runs north-south through lowland forest and highland plateau.

The north of Belize consists mostly of flat, swampy coastal plains, in places heavily forested. The [[Flora and vegetation of Belize|flora]] is highly diverse considering the small geographical area. The south contains the low [[mountain range]] of the [[Maya Mountains]]. The highest point in Belize is [[Doyle's Delight]] at {{convert|1124|m|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversity.bz/belize/topography/ |title=BERDS Topography |publisher=Biodiversity.bz |accessdate=29 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912073158/http://www.biodiversity.bz/belize/topography/ |archivedate=12 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===Geology, mineral potential, and energy===
Belize is known to have a number of economically important minerals, but none in quantities large enough to warrant mining. These minerals include [[dolomite]], [[barite]] (source of [[barium]]), [[bauxite]] (source of aluminium), [[cassiterite]] (source of tin), and gold. In 1990 [[limestone]], used in road-building, was the only mineral resource being exploited for either domestic or export use.

In 2006, the cultivation of newly discovered [[crude oil]] in the town of [[Spanish Lookout]] has presented new prospects and problems for this developing nation.<ref name="Maya Homeland">{{cite web|last=Burnett|first=John|date=11 October 2006|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6248500|title=Large Oil Field Is Found in Belize; the Angling Begins|website=npr.org}}</ref>

The Belize Barrier Reef is a series of [[coral reef]]s straddling the coast of Belize, roughly {{convert|300|m|ft|order=flip}} offshore in the north and {{convert|40|km|mi|order=flip}} in the south within the country limits. The Belize Barrier Reef is a {{convert|300|km|mi|order=flip}} long section of the {{convert|900|km|mi|order=flip}} long [[Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System]], which is continuous from [[Cancún]] on the northeast tip of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] through the [[Riviera Maya]] up to [[Honduras]] making it one of the largest coral reef systems in the world.

It is Belize's top tourist destination, popular for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkelling]], and attracting almost half of its 260,000 visitors. It is also vital to its fishing industry.<ref name="BBC News - 12 June 2006">{{cite news|last=Harrabin|first=Roger|date=12 June 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5064870.stm|title=Reef at forefront of CO2 battle|website=BBC News}}</ref> In 1842 [[Charles Darwin]] described it as "the most remarkable reef in the [[West Indies]]".

The Belize Barrier Reef was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1996 due to its vulnerability and the fact that it contains important natural habitats for in-situ conservation of biodiversity.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System – UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/764|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>

====Species====
The Belize Barrier Reef is home to a large diversity of plants and animals, and is one of the most diverse [[ecosystem]]s of the world:
* 70 hard coral species
* 36 [[Alcyonacea|soft coral]] species
* 500 species of fish
* hundreds of [[invertebrate]] species
With 90% of the reef still to be researched, some estimate that only 10% of all species have been discovered.<ref>[http://www.westminster.edu/staff/athrock/BELIZE/Reef.html Belize Barrier Reef Case Study]. Westminster.edu. Retrieved on 21 October 2011.</ref>

Despite these protective measures, the reef remains under threat from [[Marine pollution|oceanic pollution]] as well as uncontrolled tourism, shipping, and fishing. Other threats include hurricanes, along with [[global warming]] and the resulting increase in ocean temperatures,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/735941.stm "Coral Collapse in Caribbean"].

===Climate===
Belize has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s, although there are significant variations in weather patterns by region. Temperatures vary according to elevation, proximity to the coast, and the moderating effects of the northeast trade winds off the Caribbean. Average temperatures in the coastal regions range from {{convert|24|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}} in January to {{convert|27|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}} in July. Temperatures are slightly higher inland, except for the southern highland plateaus, such as the [[Mountain Pine Ridge]], where it is noticeably cooler year round. Overall, the seasons are marked more by differences in humidity and rainfall than in temperature.

Average rainfall varies considerably, from {{convert|1350|mm|in|order=flip}} in the north and west to over {{convert|4500|mm|in|order=flip}} in the extreme south. Seasonal differences in rainfall are greatest in the northern and central regions of the country where, between January and April or May, less than {{convert|100|mm|in|1|order=flip}} of rainfall per month. The dry season is shorter in the south, normally only lasting from February to April. A shorter, less rainy period, known locally as the "little dry", usually occurs in late July or August, after the initial onset of the rainy season.

[[Tropical cyclone|Hurricanes]] have played key—and devastating—roles in [[History of Belize|Belizean history]]. In 1931, an unnamed hurricane destroyed over two-thirds of the buildings in Belize City and killed more than 1,000 people. In 1955, [[Hurricane Janet]] levelled the northern town of [[Corozal Town|Corozal]]. Only six years later, [[Hurricane Hattie]] struck the central coastal area of the country, with winds in excess of {{convert|300|km/h|mph|abbr=on|order=flip|round=5}} and {{convert|4|m|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on|order=flip}} [[storm tide]]<nowiki/>s. The devastation of Belize City for the second time in thirty years prompted the relocation of the capital some {{convert|80|km|mi|0|order=flip}} inland to the [[planned city]] of [[Belmopan]].

In 1978, [[Hurricane Greta-Olivia|Hurricane Greta]] caused more than US$25&nbsp;million in damages along the southern coast. On 9 October 2001, [[Hurricane Iris]] made landfall at [[Monkey River Town]] as a {{convert|145|mph|km/h|abbr=on|round=5}} Category Four storm. The storm demolished most of the homes in the village, and destroyed the banana crop. In 2007, [[Hurricane Dean]] made landfall as a Category 5 storm only {{convert|25|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of the Belize–Mexico border. Dean caused extensive damage in northern Belize.

In 2010, Belize was directly affected by the Category 2 [[Hurricane Richard]], which made landfall approximately {{convert|20|mi|km}} south-southeast of Belize City at around 00:45 UTC on 25 October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Brown, Daniel |author2=Berg, Robbie |lastauthoramp=yes |date=25 October 2010 |title=Hurricane Richard Discussion Seventeen |publisher=National Hurricane Center |accessdate=25 October 2010 |url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2010/al19/al192010.discus.017.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029230303/http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/archive/2010/al19/al192010.discus.017.shtml |archivedate=29 October 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> The storm moved inland towards [[Belmopan]], causing estimated damage of [[Belize dollar|BZ$]]33.8&nbsp;million ($17.4&nbsp;million 2010&nbsp;USD), primarily from damage to crops and housing.<ref>[http://www.reporter.bz/?s=33.8 Hurricane Richard gives Belize wake-up call].

The new [[government of Belize]] faces important challenges to economic stability. Rapid action to improve [[tax collection]] has been promised, but a lack of progress in reining in spending could bring the [[exchange rate]] under pressure. The tourist and construction sectors strengthened in early 1999, leading to a preliminary estimate of revived growth at four percent. Infrastructure remains a major economic development challenge;<ref name="USDoS-Belize">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/1955.htm|title=Background Note: Belize|publisher=Department of State, United States}}</ref> Belize has the region's most expensive electricity.

Belize is located on the coast of Central America. Based on its location, it is seen as a beautiful destination for vacations. However, also due to its location, it is currently becoming known in the global arena for attracting many drug trafficking entities in North America. The Belize currency is pegged to the U.S. dollar. This entices drug traffickers and money launderers who want to utilize their current economic system. In addition, Belize also offers nonresidents the ability to establish offshore accounts. Because of this loophole, it is desirable for many drug traffickers and money launderers to utilize Belize as a money laundering banking entity. As a result, the [[United States Department of State]] has recently named Belize one of the world's "major money laundering countries." 2016 World Fact Book of the United States Central Intelligence Agency.

===Industrial infrastructure===
{{update|section|date=January 2014}}
The largest integrated electric utility and the principal distributor in Belize is [[Belize Electricity Limited]]. BEL was approximately 70% owned by [[Fortis Inc.]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] investor-owned distribution utility, which represented less than two percent of Fortis assets. Fortis took over the management of BEL in 1999, at the invitation of the government of Belize in an attempt to mitigate prior financial problems within the locally managed utility. In addition to its regulated investment in BEL, Fortis owns Belize Electric Company Limited (BECOL), a non-regulated [[hydroelectric]] generation business that operates three hydroelectric generating facilities on the [[Macal River]].

On 14 June 2011, the government of Belize nationalized the majority ownership interest of Fortis Inc. in Belize Electricity Ltd. The Belize utility encountered serious financial problems after the country's Public Utilities Commission (PUC) in 2008 disallowed "the recovery of previously incurred fuel and purchased power costs in customer rates and set customer rates at a level that does not allow BEL to earn a fair and reasonable return", Fortis said in a June 2011 statement.<ref>{{cite news|title=Government of Belize Announces Intent to Acquire Control of Belize Electricity Limited|url=https://www.fortisinc.com/News/Pages/Government-of-Belize-Announces-Intent-to-Acquire-Control-of-Belize-Electricity-Limited.aspx|accessdate=4 October 2016|work=Fortis Inc.|date=13 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141017151700/https://www.fortisinc.com/News/Pages/Government-of-Belize-Announces-Intent-to-Acquire-Control-of-Belize-Electricity-Limited.aspx|archivedate=17 October 2014 |location=St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada}}</ref> BEL appealed this judgment to the Court of Appeal; however, a hearing is not expected until 2012. In May 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Belize]] granted BEL's application to prevent the PUC from taking any enforcement actions pending the appeal. The Belize Chamber of Commerce and Industry issued a statement saying the government had acted in haste and expressed concern over the message it sent to investors.

In August 2009, the government of Belize nationalized [[Belize Telemedia Limited]] (BTL), which now competes directly with [[Speednet]]. As a result of the nationalisation process, the [[interconnection]] agreements are again subject to negotiations. Both BTL and Speednet boast a full range of products and services including basic telephone services, national and international calls, prepaid services, cellular services via GSM 1900 megahertz (MHz) and 4G LTE respectively, international cellular roaming, fixed wireless, fiber to the home internet service, and national and international data networks.<ref>[http://www.belize.org/tiz/telecommunication The BCCI Trade and Investment Zone – Investment Regime – Public Utilities – Telecommunication].

=== Ethnic groups ===

====The Maya====
[[File:Kek'Chi Maya Children.jpg|Mayan children|thumb]]
The Maya are thought to have been in Belize and the [[Yucatán region]] since the second millennium BC; however, much of Belize's original Maya population was wiped out by conflicts between constantly warring tribes. There were many who died of disease after contact and invasion by Europeans. Three Maya groups now inhabit the country: The [[Yucatec]] (who came from Yucatán, Mexico, to escape the savage [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]] of the 1840s), the [[Mopan people|Mopan]] (indigenous to Belize but were forced out to Guatemala by the British for raiding settlements; they returned to Belize to evade enslavement by the Guatemalans in the 19th century), and [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi']] (also fled from slavery in Guatemala in the 19th century).<ref>Cho, Julian (1998).&nbsp;{{cite web|url=http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProjectsResources/MayanAtlas/MayaAtlas/mayahome.htm |title=Maya Homeland |accessdate=3 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203235635/http://geography.berkeley.edu/ProjectsResources/MayanAtlas/MayaAtlas/mayahome.htm |archivedate=3 February 2010 |df=mdy }}.

The Maya speak their native languages and Spanish, and are also fluent in English and Belize Kriol.

====Creoles====
{{Main|Belizean Creole people|Baymen}}

Creoles, also known as ''Kriols'', make up roughly 21% of the Belizean population and about 75% of the [[Belizean American|diaspora]]. They are descendants of the Baymen slave owners, and [[slavery|slaves]] brought to Belize for the purpose of the logging industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belizenet.com/bzeguat/intro.html |title=Belize-Guatemala Territorial Issue – Chapter 1 |publisher=Belizenet.com |accessdate=29 August 2010}}</ref> These slaves were ultimately of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]]n descent (many also of [[Miskito people|Miskito]] ancestry from [[Nicaragua]]) and born Africans who had spent very brief periods in Jamaica and [[Bermuda]].<ref name="Johnson 2003 pp. 598">{{cite journal|author=Johnson, Melissa A.|title=The Making of Race and Place in Nineteenth-Century British Honduras|journal=Environmental History|volume=8|issue=4 |year=2003|pages=598–617|jstor=3985885|doi=10.2307/3985885|hdl=11214/203}}</ref> [[Caracoles|Bay Islanders]] and ethnic Jamaicans came in the late 19th century, further adding to these already varied peoples, creating this ethnic group.

For all intents and purposes, Creole is an ethnic and linguistic denomination. Some natives, even with blonde hair and blue eyes, may call themselves Creoles.<ref name="Johnson 2003 pp. 598"/>

[[Belize Creole English]] or ''Kriol'' developed during the time of slavery, and historically was only spoken by former slaves. However, this ethnicity has become an integral part of the Belizean identity, and as a result it is now spoken by about 45% of Belizeans.<ref name="census2010"/><ref name="Johnson 2003 pp. 598"/> Belizean Creole is derived mainly from English. Its [[substratum|substrate languages]] are the Native American language [[Miskito language|Miskito]], and the various [[West African]] and [[Bantu languages]] brought into the country by slaves. Creoles are found all over Belize, but predominantly in urban areas such as Belize City, coastal towns and villages, and in the Belize River Valley.<ref>[http://www.kriol.org.bz/ Belize Kriol] – Kriol.org.bz (16 March 2013).

====Garinagu====
{{Main|Garifuna people}}
[[File:Garifuna dancers in Dangriga, Belize.jpg|left|thumb|Traditional Garifuna dancers in [[Dangriga]], Belize]]
The [[Garinagu]] (singular ''Garifuna''), at around 4.5% of the population, are a mix of West/Central African, [[Arawaks|Arawak]], and [[Island Carib]] ancestry. Though they were captives removed from their homelands, these people were never documented as slaves. The two prevailing theories are that, in 1635, they were either the survivors of two recorded shipwrecks or somehow took over the ship they came on.<ref name="www2.ku.edu">{{cite journal|last=Crawford |first=M.H. |year=1997 |url=http://www2.ku.edu/~lba/courses/articles/Crawford%20Carib.pdf |title=Biocultural adaptation to disease in the Caribbean: Case study of a migrant population |journal=Journal of Caribbean Studies.

Throughout history they have been incorrectly labelled as [[Black Caribs]]. When the British took over [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, they were opposed by French settlers and their Garinagu allies. The Garinagu eventually surrendered to the British in 1796. The British separated the more African-looking Garifunas from the more indigenous-looking ones. 5,000 Garinagu were exiled from the Grenadine island of [[Baliceaux]]. However, only about 2,500 of them survived the voyage to [[Roatán]], an island off the coast of Honduras. The [[Garifuna language]] belongs to the [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan language family]], but has a large number of loanwords from Carib languages and from English.

Because [[Roatán]] was too small and infertile to support their population, the Garinagu petitioned the Spanish authorities of Honduras to be allowed to settle on the mainland coast. The Spanish employed them as soldiers, and they spread along the Caribbean coast of Central America. The Garinagu settled in Seine Bight, [[Punta Gorda, Belize|Punta Gorda]] and Punta Negra, Belize, by way of Honduras as early as 1802. However, in Belize, 19 November 1832 is the date officially recognized as "[[Garifuna Settlement Day]]" in Dangriga.<ref name="2000 Belize Census">{{cite web|url=http://celade.cepal.org/cgibin/RpWebEngine.exe/PortalAction?MODE=MAIN&BASE=CPVBLZ2000&MAIN=WebServerMain.inl |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120628225923/http://celade.cepal.org/cgibin/RpWebEngine.exe/PortalAction?MODE=MAIN&BASE=CPVBLZ2000&MAIN=WebServerMain.inl |dead-url=yes |archive-date=28 June 2012 |title=Belize 2000 Housing and Population Census |accessdate=9 September 2008 |year=2000 |publisher=Belize Central Statistical Office }}</ref>

====Mestizos====
{{Main|Hispanic Belizean|Mestizo}}
The Mestizo culture are people of mixed Spanish and Maya descent. They originally came to Belize in 1847, to escape the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]], which occurred when thousands of Mayas rose against the state in Yucatán and massacred over one-third of the population. The surviving others fled across the borders into British territory. The Mestizos are found everywhere in Belize but most make their homes in the northern districts of Corozal and Orange Walk. Some other mestizos came from [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], & [[Nicaragua]]. The Mestizos are the largest ethnic group in Belize and make up approximately half of the population. The Mestizo towns centre on a main square, and social life focuses on the Catholic Church built on one side of it. Spanish is the main language of most Mestizos and Spanish descendants, but many speak English and Belize Kriol fluently.<ref name="mybelizeadventure.com">{{cite news|title = Mestizo location in Belize; Location|url = http://www.mybelizeadventure.com/about_belize/people.php|accessdate = 14 February 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080214181257/http://www.mybelizeadventure.com/about_belize/people.php|archivedate = 14 February 2008|deadurl = yes|df = dmy-all}}</ref> Due to the influences of Kriol and English, many Mestizos speak what is known as [[Spanglish|"Kitchen Spanish"]].<ref name="ambergriscaye.com">{{cite news | title=Northern Belize Caste War History; Location | url =http://ambergriscaye.com/pages/town/holidays.html| accessdate =21 February 2013 }}</ref> The mixture of Latin and Maya foods like tamales, escabeche, chirmole, relleno, and empanadas came from their Mexican side and corn tortillas were handed down by their Mayan side.

====German-speaking Mennonites====
[[File:Menonite Children.JPG|thumb|Mennonite children selling peanuts near Lamanai in Belize.

{{Main|Mennonites in Belize}}
Some 4% of the population are German-speaking [[Mennonite]] farmers and craftsmen. The vast majority are so-called [[Russian Mennonites]] of German descent who settled in the [[Russian Empire]] during the 18th and 19th centuries. Most Russian Mennonites live in Mennonite settlements like [[Spanish Lookout]], [[Shipyard, Belize|Shipyard]], [[Little Belize]], and Blue Creek. These Mennonites speak [[Plautdietsch]] (a [[Low German|Low German dialect]]) in everyday life, but use mostly [[Standard German]] for reading (the Bible) and writing. The Plautdietsch-speaking [[Mennonites in Mexico|Mennonites came mostly from Mexico]] in the years after 1958 and they are trilingual with Spanish. There are also some mainly [[Pennsylvania German]]-speaking [[Old Order Mennonites]] who came from the United States and Canada in the late 1960s. They live primarily in [[Upper Barton Creek]] and associated settlements. These Mennonites attracted people from different [[Anabaptist]] backgrounds who formed a new community. They look quite similar to [[Amish|Old Order Amish]], but are different from them.<ref>Gingerich, Melvin and Loewen, John B. (May 2013) [http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Belize&oldid=122447 "Belize"]. Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online.</ref>

====Other groups====
The remaining 5% or so of the population consist of a mix of [[Indians in Belize|Indians]], [[Ethnic Chinese in Belize|Chinese]], [[White people|Whites]] from the United Kingdom, United States and Canada, and many other foreign groups brought to assist the country's development. During the 1860s, a large influx of East Indians who spent brief periods in Jamaica and [[American Civil War]] veterans from [[Louisiana]] and other Southern states established [[Confederate settlements in British Honduras]] and introduced commercial sugar cane production to the colony, establishing 11 settlements in the interior. The 20th century saw the arrival of more Asian settlers from mainland China, South Korea, India, [[Syria]], and [[Lebanon]]. [[Said Musa]], the son of an immigrant from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], was the [[Prime Minister of Belize]] from 1998 to 2008. [[Central American]] immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, & Nicaragua and expatriate Americans and Africans also began to settle in the country.<ref name="2000 Belize Census" />

====Emigration, immigration, and demographic shifts====
Creoles and other ethnic groups are emigrating mostly to the United States, but also to the United Kingdom and other developed nations for better opportunities. Based on the latest [[US Census]], the number of Belizeans in the United States is approximately 160,000 (including 70,000 legal residents and naturalized citizens), consisting mainly of Creoles and Garinagu.<ref>[https://www.census.gov "Diaspora of Belize"]. Council on Diplomacy, Washington, D.C. and Consulate General of Belize.</ref>

Because of conflicts in neighbouring Central American nations, Mestizo [[refugee]]s from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras have fled to Belize in significant numbers during the 1980s, and have been significantly adding to this group.

{{Main|Languages of Belize}}

English is the official language of Belize, a former British colony. Belize is the only country in Central America whose official language is English. Also, English is the primary language of public education, government and most media outlets. About half of Belizeans regardless of ethnicity speak an [[English-based creole]] called [[Belizean Creole]] (also referred to as ''Kriol'') for most informal, social and interethnic dialogue.

When a Creole language exists alongside its [[lexifier]] language, as is the case in Belize, a continuum forms between the Creole and the lexifier language. It is therefore difficult to substantiate or differentiate the number of Creole speakers compared to English speakers. Belizean Creole might best be described as the [[lingua franca]] of the nation.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/bzj Belize Kriol English]. Ethnologue</ref>

Approximately 50% of Belizeans self-identify as ''Mestizo'', ''Latino'', or ''Hispanic'' and 30% speak [[Belizean Spanish|Spanish]] as a native language.<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/BZ/languages Belize languages]. Ethnologue.</ref> When Belize was a British colony, Spanish was banned in schools but today it is widely taught as a [[second language]]. [[Spanglish|"Kitchen Spanish"]] is an intermediate form of Spanish mixed with Belizean Creole, spoken in the northern towns such as Corozal and San Pedro.<ref name="ambergriscaye.com"/>

Over half the population is [[multilingual]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Merrill|first1=Tim|title=Guyana and Belize: Country Studies|date=1993|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|page=201}}</ref> Being a small, multiethnic state, surrounded by Spanish-speaking nations, multilingualism is strongly encouraged.<ref name="belize2011">[https://www.belize.com/belize-demographics Belize Demographics And Population Data]. Belize.com (2011).</ref>

Belize is also home to three [[Mayan languages]]: [[Q'eqchi' language|Q'eqchi']], [[Mopan language|Mopan]] (an [[endangered language]]), and [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec Maya]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/kek Q'eqchi']. Ethnologue</ref><ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/mop Maya, Mopán]. Ethnologue</ref><ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/yua Maya, Yucatec]. Ethnologue</ref>
Approximately 16,100 people speak the [[Ta-Arawakan languages|Arawakan-based]] [[Garifuna language]],<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/cab Garifuna]. Ethnologue</ref> and 6,900 Mennonites in Belize speak mainly [[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]] while a minority of Mennonites speak [[Pennsylvania German language|Pennsylvania German]].<ref>[http://www.ethnologue.com/language/pdt Plautdietsch].

According to the 2010 census,<ref name="census2010"/> 40.1% of Belizeans are [[Roman Catholics]], 31.8% are [[Protestants]] (8.4% [[Pentecostal]]; 5.4% [[Adventist]]; 4.7% [[Anglican]]; 3.7% [[Mennonite]]; 3.6% [[Baptist]]; 2.9% [[Methodist]]; 2.8% [[Church of the Nazarene|Nazarene]]), 1.7% are [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], 10.3% adhere to other religions ([[Maya religion]], [[Garifuna religion]], [[Obeah]] and [[Myalism]], and minorities of [[Mormonism|Mormons]], [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]], [[Islam|Muslims]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], [[Rastafarians]] and other) and 15.5% profess to be irreligious.

According to PROLADES, Belize was 64.6% Roman Catholic, 27.8% Protestant, 7.6% Other in 1971.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.prolades.com/cra/regions/cam/bel/belize_census_1970-2010.pdf | title=National Census of Belize Religious Affiliation, 1970–2010 | first=Clifton L. | last=Holland | date=8 September 2011 | accessdate=8 May 2017 }}</ref> Until the late 1990s, Belize was [[History of Roman Catholicism in Belize|a Roman Catholic majority country]]. Catholics formed 57% of the population in 1991, and dropped to 49% in 2000. The percentage of Roman Catholics in the population has been decreasing in the past few decades due to the growth of Protestant churches, other religions and non-religious people.<ref>[http://www.caricomstats.org/Files/Publications/NCR%20Reports/Belize.pdf Belize 2000 Census]. caricomstats.org</ref>

In addition to Catholics, there has always been [[Protestantism in Belize|a large accompanying Protestant minority]]. It was brought by [[British people|British]], [[German people|German]], and other settlers to the British colony of [[British Honduras]]. From the beginning, it was largely [[Anglican]] and [[Mennonite]] in nature. The Protestant community in Belize experienced a large [[Pentecostal]] and [[Seventh-Day Adventist]] influx tied to the recent spread of various [[Evangelical Protestant]] denominations throughout [[Latin America]]. Geographically speaking, [[Mennonites in Belize|German Mennonites]] live mostly in the rural districts of Cayo and Orange Walk.

The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] estimates there were 7,776 Bahá'ís in Belize in 2005, or 2.5% of the national population.

=== Health ===
{{Further|Healthcare in Belize}}

Belize has a high prevalence of communicable diseases such as respiratory diseases and intestinal illnesses.<ref name=MoH>[https://www.healthresearchweb.org/files/National_Health_Policies-Belize_2007-2011.pdf Health Agenda 2007 – 2011]. Ministry of Health, Belize</ref>

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Belize}}
A number of kindergartens, secondary, and tertiary schools in Belize provide quality education for students—mostly funded by the government. Belize has about a dozen [[List of universities in Belize|tertiary level institutions]], the most prominent of which is the [[University of Belize]], which evolved out of the University College of Belize founded in 1986. Before that [[St. John's College, Belize|St. John's College]], founded in 1877, dominated the tertiary education field. The Open Campus of the [[University of the West Indies]] has a site in Belize.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Open Campus in Belize |url=http://www.open.uwi.edu/belize |website=Open Campus |publisher=The University of the West Indies |accessdate=16 March 2019}}</ref> It also has campuses in [[Barbados]], [[Trinidad]], and [[Jamaica]]. The government of Belize contributes financially to the UWI.

Education in Belize is compulsory between the ages of 6 and 14 years. {{As of|2010}}, the literacy rate in Belize was estimated at 79.7%,<ref name="census2010"/> one of the [[List of countries by literacy rate|lowest in the Western Hemisphere]].

The educational policy is currently following the "Education Sector Strategy 2011–2016", which sets three objectives for the years to come: Improving access, quality, and governance of the education system by providing technical and [[vocational education]] and training.<ref>[http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=BLZ UNESCO-UNEVOC country profile (2013)].

===Crime===
Belize has relatively high rates of violent crime.<ref name="state1">{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1055.html|title=Belize: Country Specific Information|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=17 May 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501204518/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1055.html|archivedate=1 May 2013}}</ref> The majority of violence in Belize stems from gang activity, which includes trafficking of drugs and persons, protecting drug smuggling routes, and securing territory for drug dealing.<ref name="police2006">{{cite web|title=Serious Crimes Comparative Summary 2006–2007 |url=http://police.gov.bz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=74&Itemid=26 |publisher=Belize Police Department |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605094405/http://police.gov.bz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=74&Itemid=26 |archivedate=5 June 2013}}</ref>

In 2015, 119 murders were recorded in Belize, giving the country a homicide rate of 34 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, one of the highest in the world, but lower than the neighbouring countries of [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], and [[Guatemala]].<ref name="murders">{{cite news|title=Belize Murders Down Slightly, Amidst Regional Spike|url=http://www.7newsbelize.com/sstory.php?nid=34834|accessdate=13 January 2016|work=7 News Belize|date=6 January 2016}}</ref> Compared to the other districts in Belize, [[Belize District]] (containing Belize City) had the most murders by far compared to all the other districts.

In 2015, there were 40 reported cases of rape, 214 robberies, 742 burglaries, and 1027 cases of theft.<ref name="murders"/>

The Belize Police Department has implemented many protective measures in hopes of decreasing the high number of crimes. These measures include adding more patrols to "hot spots" in the city, obtaining more resources to deal with the predicament, creating the "Do the Right Thing for Youths at Risk" program, creating the Crime Information Hotline, creating the Yabra Citizen Development Committee, an organisation that helps youth, and many other initiatives. The Belize Police Department began an Anti-Crime Christmas campaign targeting criminals; as a result, the crime rates dropped in that month.<ref name="police2006"/> In 2011, the government established a truce among many major gangs, lowering the murder rate.<ref name="state1"/>

=== Social structure ===
{{Further|Belizean society}}

Belize's social structure is marked by enduring differences in the distribution of wealth, power, and prestige. Because of the small size of Belize's population and the intimate scale of social relations, the social distance between the rich and the poor, while significant, is nowhere as vast as in other [[Caribbean]] and [[Central America]]n societies, such as [[Jamaica]] and [[El Salvador]]. Belize lacks the violent class and racial conflict that has figured so prominently in the social life of its Central American neighbours.<ref name=sbs>Rutheiser, Charles C., "Structure of Belizean Society". In Merrill.</ref>

Political and economic power remain vested in the hands of the local elite. The sizable middle group is composed of peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. This middle group does not constitute a unified [[social class]], but rather a number of middle-class and [[working-class]] groups, loosely oriented around shared dispositions toward education, cultural respectability, and possibilities for upward social mobility. These beliefs, and the social practices they engender, help distinguish the middle group from the grass roots majority of the [[Belizean people]].<ref name=sbs/>

===Women===
In 2013, the [[World Economic Forum]] ranked Belize 101st out of 135 countries in its [[Global Gender Gap Report]]. Of all the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, Belize ranked 3rd from last and had the lowest female-to-male ratio for primary school enrollment.<ref name="ggr">{{cite web|title=The Global Gender Gap Report 2012|url=http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GenderGap_Report_2012.pdf|publisher=World Economic Forum}}</ref> In 2013, the [[United Nations|UN]] gave Belize a [[Gender Inequality Index]] score of 0.435, ranking it 79th out of 148 countries.<ref name="hdr">{{cite web|title=Human Development Report |url=http://hdr.undp.org/hdr4press/press/report/hdr/english/HDR2013_EN_Complete.pdf |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |year=2013}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Belize}}

In Belizean folklore, there are the legends of [[Lang Bobi Suzi]], [[La Llorona]], [[La Sucia]], [[Tata Duende]], [[X'tabai]], [[Anansi]], [[Xtabay]], Sisimite and the [[cadejo]].

Most of the [[public holidays in Belize]] are traditional Commonwealth and [[liturgical year|Christian holidays]], although some are specific to Belizean culture such as [[Garifuna Settlement Day]] and [[Baron Bliss Day]].<ref>[http://www.belizenet.com "National Holidays of Belize"] Council on Diplomacy, Washington, D.C. and Consulate General of Belize. Retrieved 5 February 2008.</ref> In addition, the month of September is considered a [[September Celebrations of Belize|special time of national celebration]]. Besides [[Independence Day]] and St. George's Caye Day, Belizeans also celebrate [[Carnival]] during September, which typically includes several events spread across multiple days. In some areas of Belize, however, Carnival is celebrated at the traditional time before [[Lent]] (in February).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Briceño|first=J.|title=Carnival in Northern Belize|journal=Belizean Studies|year=1981|volume=9|issue=3|pages=1–7}}</ref>

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuisine of Belize}}
[[File:Rice and Beans, Stew Chicken and Potato Salad - Belize.jpg|right|thumb|Rice and beans (with coconut milk), stewed recado chicken and potato salad. An inter-ethnic staple meal]]
Belizean cuisine is an amalgamation of all ethnicity in the nation, and their respectively wide variety of foods. It might best be described as both similar to Mexican/Central American cuisine and Jamaican/Anglo-Caribbean cuisine.

Breakfast typically consists of bread, flour [[tortilla]]s, or [[fry jack]]s that are often homemade. Fry jacks are eaten with various cheeses, [[refried beans]], various forms of eggs or cereal, along with powdered milk, coffee, or tea. Midday meals vary, from foods such as rice and beans with or without coconut milk, [[tamale]]s (fried maize shells with beans or fish), [[empanadas|"panades"]], meat pies, [[escabeche]] (onion soup), [[chimole]] (soup), [[caldo de pollo|caldo]], stewed chicken and garnaches (fried tortillas with beans, cheese, and sauce) to various constituted dinners featuring some type of rice and beans, meat and salad or coleslaw.

In rural areas, meals are typically more simple than in cities. The Maya use [[maize]], [[bean]]s, or [[Cucurbita|squash]] for most meals, and the Garifuna are fond of seafood, [[cassava]] (particularly made into cassava bread or Ereba) and vegetables. The nation abounds with restaurants and fast food establishments selling fairly cheaply. Local fruits are quite common, but raw vegetables from the markets less so. Mealtime is a communion for families and schools and some businesses close at midday for lunch, reopening later in the afternoon. Steak is also common.

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Belize}}
[[Punta]] is a popular genre of [[Garifuna music]] and has become one of the most popular kinds of music in Belize. It is distinctly Afro-Caribbean, and is sometimes said to be ready for international popularization like similarly-descended styles ([[reggae]], [[calypso music|calypso]], [[merengue (music)|merengue]]).

[[Brukdown]] is a modern style of Belizean music related to [[Calypso music|calypso]]. It evolved out of the music and dance of loggers, especially a form called [[buru]]. [[Reggae]], [[dancehall]], and [[Soca music|soca]] imported from [[Jamaica]] and the rest of the [[West Indies]], [[rapping|rap]], [[hip-hop]], heavy metal and [[rock music]] from the United States, are also popular among the youth of Belize.

===Sports===
{{Main|Sport in Belize}}
[[File:Shalini Zabaneh, Cyclist, Belize.jpg|thumb|left|Accomplished Belizean cyclist Shalini Zabaneh]]
The major sports in Belize are [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]] and [[Cycle sport|cycling]], with smaller followings of [[boat racing]], [[Sport of athletics|athletics]], [[softball]], [[cricket]], [[Rugby football|rugby]] and [[netball]]. [[Fishing]] is also popular in coastal areas of Belize.

The [[Cross Country Cycling Classic]], also known as the "cross country" race or the Holy Saturday Cross Country Cycling Classic, is considered one of the most important Belize sports events. This one-day sports event is meant for amateur cyclists but has also gained worldwide popularity. The history of Cross Country Cycling Classic in Belize dates back to the period when [[Monrad Metzgen]] picked up the idea from a small village on the [[Northern Highway (Belize)|Northern Highway]] (now Phillip Goldson Highway). The people from this village used to cover long distances on their bicycles to attend the weekly game of cricket. He improvised on this observation by creating a sporting event on the difficult terrain of the [[George Price Highway|Western Highway]], which was then poorly built.

Another major annual sporting event in Belize is the [[La Ruta Maya Belize River Challenge]], a 4-day [[canoe marathon]] held each year in March. The race runs from [[San Ignacio, Belize|San Ignacio]] to [[Belize City]], a distance of {{convert|180|mi|km}}.<ref name="Peddicord">{{cite web|last1=Peddicord|first1=Kathleen|title=La Ruta Maya – One of the World's Toughest and Most Historic River Races|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kathleen-peddicord/la-ruta-mayaone-of-the-wo_b_6652828.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=4 March 2016|date=11 February 2015}}</ref>

On Easter day, citizens of Dangriga participate in a yearly fishing tournament. First, second, and third prize are awarded based on a scoring combination of size, species, and number. The tournament is broadcast over local radio stations, and prize money is awarded to the winners.

The [[Belize national basketball team]] is the only national team that has achieved major victories internationally. The team won the 1998 CARICOM Men's Basketball Championship, held at the Civic Center in Belize City, and subsequently participated in the 1999 Centrobasquet Tournament in Havana. The national team finished seventh of eight teams after winning only 1 game despite playing close all the way. In a return engagement at the 2000 CARICOM championship in Barbados, Belize placed fourth. Shortly thereafter, Belize moved to the Central American region and won the Central American Games championship in 2001.

The team has failed to duplicate this success, most recently finishing with a 2 and 4 record in the 2006 COCABA championship. The team finished second in the 2009 COCABA tournament in Cancun, Mexico where it went 3–0 in group play. Belize won its opening match in the Centrobasquet Tournament, 2010, defeating Trinidad and Tobago, but lost badly to Mexico in a rematch of the COCABA final. A tough win over Cuba set Belize in position to advance, but they fell to Puerto Rico in their final match and failed to qualify.

[[Simone Biles]], the winner of four gold medals in the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is a dual citizen of the United States and of Belize,<ref name="Gazette">{{cite web|url=http://www.haitigazette.com/belize-tourism-scores-gold-with-simone-biles-tweet/ |title=Belize Tourism Scores Gold With Simone Biles Tweet |editor=Staff |date=12 August 2016 |publisher=Haiti Gazette |accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref> which she considers her second home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/08/16/sport/simone-biles-belize-ties-rio-olympics-gymnastics-2016/ |title=Simone Biles has support in another country: Belize |editor=Martin, Jill |editor2=Lopez, Elwyn |date=16 August 2016 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=27 August 2016}}</ref> Biles is herself Belizean-American in descent.<ref name="Laymon">{{cite web |url=http://gymnasticsnewsnetwork.com/even-world-champions-need-a-vacation/ |title=Even World Champions Need A Vacation |last1=Laymon |first1=Terri |date= |website=gymnasticsnewsnetwork.com |publisher= |access-date=August 15, 2016 |quote=Biles' mother, Nellie Cayetano, is Belizean, while Biles herself is a Belizean-American of [[Garifuna people|Garifuna]] descent.}}</ref>

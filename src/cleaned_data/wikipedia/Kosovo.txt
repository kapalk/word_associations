Defined in an area of {{convert|10908|km2|sqmi}}, Kosovo is [[landlocked]] in the center of the [[Balkans]] and bordered by the uncontested territory of Serbia to the north and east, [[North Macedonia]] to the southeast, [[Albania]] to the southwest and [[Montenegro]] to the west. [[Geography of Kosovo|Geographically]], Kosovo possesses varied and opposing landscapes for its size determined by the ideal [[Climate of Kosovo|climate]] along with the [[geology]] and [[hydrology]]. Most of central Kosovo is dominated by the vast plains and fields of [[Dukagjini Plain|Dukagjin]] and [[Kosovo field (Kosovo)|Kosovo]]. The [[Albanian Alps]] and [[Šar Mountains]] rise in the southwest and southeast respectively.
 
The earliest known human settlements in what is now Kosovo were the [[Paleolithic]] [[Vinča culture|Vinča]] and [[Starčevo culture|Starčevo]] cultures. During the [[classical antiquity|Classical]] period, it was inhabited by the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]]-[[Dardanians (Balkans)|Dardanian]] and [[Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe|Celtic]] people.

The entire region that today corresponds to the territory is commonly referred to in [[English language|English]] simply as ''Kosovo'' and in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] as ''Kosova'' or ''Kosovë'' ([[Albanian grammar|definite form]], {{IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːva}}) or ''{{lang|sq|Kosovë}}'' ([[Albanian grammar|"indefinite" form]], {{IPA-sq|kɔˈsɔːv}}). In Serbia, a formal distinction is made between the eastern and western areas; the term ''{{lang|sr-Latn|Kosovo}}'' ({{lang|sr|Косово}}) is used for the eastern part centred on the historical [[Kosovo field (region)|Kosovo Field]], while the western part is called ''[[Metohija]]'' ({{lang|sr|Метохија}}) (known as ''Dukagjini'' in Albanian).<ref name="constitution-serbia">{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_ceo.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127021637/http://www.parlament.gov.rs/content/eng/akta/ustav/ustav_ceo.asp|archivedate=27 November 2010 |title=Constitution of the Republic of Serbia |publisher=Parlament.gov.rs |accessdate=2 January 2011}}</ref>

According to one theory, ''Kosovo'' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Косово}}, {{IPA-sr|kôsoʋo}}) is the Serbian neuter [[possessive adjective]] of ''kos'' (кос) "[[Turdus merula|blackbird]]", an [[ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]] for ''Kosovo Polje'', 'blackbird field', the name of [[Kosovo field (region)|a plain]] situated in the eastern half of today's Kosovo and the site of the 1389 [[Battle of Kosovo|Battle of Kosovo Field]].<ref name="Inc.2015">{{cite book|author=IBP, Inc.|title=Kosovo Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|date=June 2015

[[Albanians]] also refer to Kosovo as [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]], the name of a Roman province formed in 165 BC, which covered the territory of modern Kosovo. The name is derived from ancient tribe of [[Dardani]], ultimately from proto-Albanian word ''dardha/dardā'' which means "pear".<ref>Albanian Etymological Dictionary, V.Orel, Koninklijke Brill, Leiden Boston Köln 1998, p.56</ref> The former Kosovo President [[Ibrahim Rugova]] had been an enthusiastic backer of a "Dardanian" identity and the Kosovan flag and presidential seal refer to this national identity. However, the name "Kosova" remains more widely used among the Albanian population.

The current borders of Kosovo were drawn while part of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] in 1945, when the [[Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945–1963)]] was created as an administrative division of the new [[People's Republic of Serbia]].

The favorable position as well as abundant natural resources were ideal for the development of life since the prehistoric periods, proven by hundreds of archaeological sites discovered and identified throughout Kosovo, which proudly present its rich archeological heritage.<ref name="Milot Berisha 2012, Pg.7">Milot Berisha, ''Archaeological Guide of Kosovo'', Prishtinë, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.7.</ref> The number of sites with archaeological potential is increasing, this as a result of findings and investigations that are carried out throughout Kosovo but also from many superficial traces which offer a new overview of antiquity of Kosovo.<ref name="Milot Berisha 2012, Pg.7"/>

The earliest traces documented in the territory of Kosovo belong to the [[Stone Age]] Period, namely there are indications that cave dwellings might have existed like for example the Radivojce Cave set near the spring of the [[Drin (river)|Drin]] river, then there are some indications at Grnčar Cave in the [[Vitina (town)|Vitina]] municipality, Dema and Karamakaz Caves of [[Peć]] and others. However, human settlement during the [[Paleolithic]] or Old Stone Age is not confirmed yet and not scientifically proven.

Therefore, until arguments of Paleolithic and [[Mesolithic]] man are confirmed, Neolithic man, respectively the Neolithic sites are considered as the chronological beginning of population in Kosovo. From this period until today Kosovo has been inhabited, and traces of activities of societies from prehistoric, ancient and up to medieval time are visible throughout its territory. Whereas, in some archaeological sites, multilayer settlements clearly reflect the continuity of life through centuries.<ref>Milot Berisha, ''Archaeological Guide of Kosovo'', Prishtinë, Kosovo Archaeological Institute and Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports, 2012, Pg.8.</ref>

During antiquity, the area which now makes up Kosovo was inhabited by various tribal ethnic groups, who were liable to move, enlarge, fuse and fissure with neighbouring groups. As such, it is difficult to locate any such group with precision. The ''Dardani'', whose exact ethno-linguistic affiliation is difficult to determine, were a prominent group in the region during the late Hellenistic and early Roman eras.<ref>N G Hammond, ''The Kingdoms of Illyria c. 400&nbsp;– 167 BC.'' ''Collected Studies,'' Vol 2, 1993</ref><ref>Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians, 1992, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, p. 85, "...

The area was then conquered by Rome in the 160s BC, and incorporated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in 59 BC. Subsequently, it became part of [[Moesia Superior]] in AD 87. The region was exposed to an increasing number of 'barbarian' raids from the 4th century AD onwards, culminating with the [[Slavic migrations]] of the 6th and 7th centuries. Archaeologically, the early Middle Ages represent a hiatus in the material record,{{sfn|Curta|2001|p=189}} and whatever was left of the native provincial population fused into the Slavs.<ref name="Stipčević1977">{{cite book|author=Aleksandar Stipčević|title=The Illyrians: history and culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcWAQAAIAAJ|year=1977|publisher=Noyes Press|isbn=978-0-8155-5052-5|page=76|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101053811/https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcWAQAAIAAJ|archivedate=1 January 2016}}</ref>

The subsequent political and [[demographic history of Kosovo]] is not known with absolute certainty until the 13th century. Archaeological findings suggest that there was steady population recovery and progression of the [[Slavic culture]] seen elsewhere throughout the [[Balkans]]. The region was absorbed into the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] in the 850s, where [[Byzantine culture]] was cemented in the region. It was re-taken by the Byzantines after 1018, and became part of the newly established [[Bulgaria (theme)|Theme of Bulgaria]].

The zenith of Serbian power was reached in 1346, with the formation of the [[Serbian Empire]]. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Kosovo became a political, cultural and religious centre of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Kingdom]]. In the late 13th century, the seat of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Archbishopric]] was moved to [[Peć]], and rulers centred themselves between [[Prizren]] and [[Skopje]],<ref>Denis P Hupchik.

Kosovo was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1455 to 1912, at first as part of the ''[[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|eyalet]]'' of [[Rumelia]], and from 1864 as a separate [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|province]] (''[[vilayet]]''). During this time, [[Islam]] was introduced to the population. The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sandžak]] region cutting into present-day [[Šumadija and Western Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kukës]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western North Macedonia with the city of [[Skopje]] (then Üsküp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day North Macedonia, including larger urban settlements such as [[Štip]] (''İştip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova''). Serbs likely formed a majority of Kosovo from the 8th to the mid-19th century.{{sfn|Banac|p=42}}<ref>''The Balkans: A Post-Communist History'', I Jeffries, R Bideleux 2007, p. 513</ref> Some scholars, such as the historian Fredrick F.

Although initially stout opponents of the advancing Turks, Albanian chiefs ultimately came to accept the Ottomans as sovereigns. The resulting alliance facilitated the mass conversion of Albanians to Islam. Given that the Ottoman Empire's subjects were divided along religious (rather than ethnic) lines, Islamisation greatly elevated the status of Albanian chiefs. Prior to this, they were organised along simple tribal lines, living in the mountainous areas of modern Albania (from Kruje to the Šar range).<ref>Fine (1994), p. 51.: "The Albanians were not to create any structure resembling a state until the fifteenth century. However, organised in tribes under their own chieftains, the Albanians dominated the mountains of most of what we today think of as Albania."</ref> Soon, they expanded into a depopulated Kosovo,<ref>Cirkovic. Pg 244 "In Kosovo there were visible signs of ethnic change which had accumulated since the [[Middle Ages]] with the immigration of Albanian cattle farmers. In addition to the continual flow of settlers and the Islamicisation of urban centres, changes in the population were also caused by political events ... Serbs left territories still under the Sultan's control."</ref> as well as northwestern Macedonia, although some might have been autochthonous to the region.{{sfn|Banac|p=46}} However, Banac favours the idea that the main settlers of the time were Vlachs.{{sfn|Banac|p=42}}

Many Albanians gained prominent positions in the Ottoman government. "Albanians had little cause of unrest", according to author Dennis Hupchik. "If anything, they grew important in Ottoman internal affairs."<ref name="hupchik">''The Balkans. From Constantinople to Communism'', Dennis Hupchik</ref> In the 19th century, there was an [[Rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire|awakening]] of [[ethnic nationalism]] throughout the Balkans.

In 1878 the [[League of Prizren]] ({{lang|sq|Lidhja e Prizrenit}}) was formed.
This was a political organisation that sought to unify all the Albanians of the Ottoman Empire in a common struggle for autonomy and greater cultural rights,<ref>''Kosovo: What Everyone Needs to Know'' by Tim Judah, Publisher [[Oxford University Press]], US, 2008 {{ISBN|0-19-537673-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-537673-9}} page 36</ref> although they generally desired the continuation of the Ottoman Empire.<ref>Cirkovic.

The [[Young Turk]] movement took control of the Ottoman Empire after a coup in 1912 which deposed Sultan [[Abdul Hamid&nbsp;II]]. The movement supported a centralised form of government and opposed any sort of autonomy desired by the various nationalities of the Ottoman Empire.

A wave of Albanians in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman army]] ranks also deserted during this period, refusing to fight their own kin. In September 1912, a joint Balkan force made up of Serbian, Montenegrin, Bulgarian and Greek forces drove the Ottomans out of most of their European possessions.

In the winter of 1915–16, during [[World War I]], Kosovo saw the retreat of the Serbian army as Kosovo was occupied by [[Bulgaria]] and [[Austria–Hungary|Austria-Hungary]]. In 1918, the Allied Powers pushed the [[Central Powers]] out of Kosovo. After the end of World War I, the Kingdom of Serbia was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians]] on 1 December 1918.

Kosovo was split into four counties, three being a part of Serbia ([[Zvečan]], Kosovo and southern [[Metohija]]) and one of Montenegro (northern Metohija). However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts ([[oblast]]) of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Raška and Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]]. In order to change the [[Demographics of Kosovo|ethnic composition of Kosovo]], between 1912 and 1941 a [[Colonisation of Kosovo|large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo]] was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.<ref name = "Schabnel 2001 20"/>

Albanians and other [[Muslims]] were forced to emigrate, mainly with the land reform which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures.<ref name="daskalovski">Daskalovski, Židas.

After the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.<ref>Malcolm, Noel ''Kosovo: A Short History'', p.312</ref> An official investigation conducted by the Yugoslav government in 1964 recorded nearly 8,000 war-related fatalities in Kosovo between 1941 and 1945, 5,489 of whom were Serb and Montenegrin and 2,177 of whom were Albanian.<ref>{{cite book|last = Frank|first = Chaim|editor1-last = Petersen|editor1-first = Hans-Christian|editor2-last = Salzborn|editor2-first = Samuel|year = 2010|title = Antisemitism in Eastern Europe: History and Present in Comparison|publisher = Peter Lang|location = [[Bern]]|isbn = 978-3-631-59828-3|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k6sqlTGHpsAC|pp = 97–98|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151016003257/https://books.google.com/books?id=k6sqlTGHpsAC|archivedate = 16 October 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> It is not disputed that between 1941 and 1945 tens of thousands of Serbs, mostly recent colonists, fled from Kosovo.

The province as in its outline today first took shape in 1945 as the ''Autonomous Kosovo-Metohian Area''. Until World War II, the only entity bearing the name of Kosovo had been a political unit carved from the former [[vilayet]] which bore no special significance to its internal population. In the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a vilayet with its borders having been revised on several occasions. When the [[Kosovo Province, Ottoman Empire|Ottoman province]] had last existed, it included areas which were by now either ceded to [[Albania]], or found themselves within the newly created Yugoslav republics of [[SR Montenegro|Montenegro]], or [[SR Macedonia|Macedonia]] (including its previous capital, [[Skopje]]) with another part in the [[Sandžak]] region of southwest Serbia.

Tensions between ethnic Albanians and the Yugoslav government were significant, not only due to ethnic tensions but also due to political ideological concerns, especially regarding relations with neighbouring Albania.<ref name="Kosovo. 2000.

[[Islam]] in Kosovo at this time was repressed and both Albanians and Muslim Slavs were encouraged to declare themselves to be Turkish and emigrate to Turkey.<ref name="Kosovo. 2000.

Pp. 35"/>

After the ouster of Ranković in 1966, the agenda of pro-decentralisation reformers in Yugoslavia, especially from Slovenia and Croatia, succeeded in the late 1960s in attaining substantial decentralisation of powers, creating substantial autonomy in Kosovo and Vojvodina, and recognising a [[Bosniaks|Muslim Yugoslav]] nationality.<ref name="Melissa Katherine Bokovoy 1992.

[[File:SocialistYugoslavia en.svg|right|thumb|Republics and provinces of the SFR Yugoslavia]]
In the aftermath of the 1974 constitution, concerns over the rise of Albanian nationalism in Kosovo rose with the widespread celebrations in 1978 of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the [[League of Prizren]].<ref name="Kosovo. 2000.

Pp. 36"/>

Due to very high [[birth rate]]s, the proportion of Albanians increased from 75% to over 90%. In contrast, the number of Serbs barely increased, and in fact dropped from 15% to 8% of the total population, since many Serbs departed from Kosovo as a response to the tight economic climate and increased incidents with their Albanian neighbours. While there was tension, charges of "genocide" and planned harassment have been debunked as an excuse to revoke Kosovo's autonomy. For example, in 1986 the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] published an official claim that Kosovo Serbs were being subjected to an Albanian program of 'genocide'.<ref name="books.google.com">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ap8wa_YmT2QC&pg=PA215 |title=Religion and the Creation of Race and Ethnicity: An Introduction |publisher=New York University Press |accessdate=20 July 2009 |isbn=978-0-8147-6701-6 |editor-last=Prentiss |editor-first=Craig R |year=2003}}</ref>

On 10 June 1999, the UN Security Council passed [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], which placed Kosovo under transitional UN administration (UNMIK) and authorised [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR), a NATO-led peacekeeping force. Resolution 1244 provided that Kosovo would have autonomy within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and affirmed the [[territorial integrity]] of Yugoslavia, which has been legally succeeded by the Republic of Serbia.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Resolution 1244 (1999) |date=17 June 1999 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/371562.stm |accessdate=19 February 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407233507/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/371562.stm |archivedate=7 April 2008  }}</ref>

International negotiations began in 2006 to determine the final status of Kosovo, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]]. The UN-backed talks, led by UN [[Diplomatic rank|Special Envoy]] [[Martti Ahtisaari]], began in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.<ref>"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307072437/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm |date=7 March 2016 }} ", ''BBC News'', 9 October 2006.</ref>

In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft [[United Nations Security Council Resolution|UN Security Council Resolution]] which proposed 'supervised independence' for the province. A draft resolution, backed by the United States, the United Kingdom and other European members of the [[Security Council]], was presented and rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702211016/http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|archivedate=2 July 2007 |title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status |author=Southeast European Times |date=29 June 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref>

After many weeks of discussions at the UN, the United States, United Kingdom and other European members of the Security Council formally 'discarded' a draft resolution backing Ahtisaari's proposal on 20 July 2007, having failed to secure Russian backing. Beginning in August, a "[[wikt:troika|Troika]]" consisting of negotiators from the European Union ([[Wolfgang Ischinger]]), the United States ([[Frank G.

The Serb minority of Kosovo, which largely opposes the declaration of independence, has formed the [[Community of Serb Municipalities|Community Assembly of Kosovo and Metohija]] in response.

On 8 October 2008, the UN General Assembly resolved, on a proposal by Serbia, to ask the International Court of Justice to render an advisory opinion on the legality of Kosovo's declaration of independence. The advisory opinion, which is not binding over decisions by states to recognise or not recognise Kosovo, was rendered on 22 July 2010, holding that Kosovo's declaration of independence was not in violation either of general principles of international law, which do not prohibit unilateral declarations of independence, nor of specific international law&nbsp;– in particular UNSCR 1244&nbsp;– which did not define the final status process nor reserve the outcome to a decision of the Security Council.<ref name="icj-cij">{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=4&code=kos&case=141&k=21|title=Advisory Proceedings&nbsp;&#124;&nbsp;International Court of Justice|publisher=icj-cij.org|accessdate=3 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208141833/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/index.php?p1=3&p2=4&code=kos&case=141&k=21|archivedate=8 February 2014}}</ref>

The [[Government of Kosovo|Government]] exercises the executive power and is composed of the [[Prime Minister of Kosovo|Prime Minister]] as the [[head of government]], the Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers of the various ministries.

The judiciary is composed of the Supreme Court and subordinate courts, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and independent prosecutorial institutions. There also exist multiple independent institutions defined by the constitution and law, as well as local governments.

The [[Albania–Kosovo relations|relations with Albania]] are in a special case, considering that the two share the same language. The [[Albanian language]] is one of the [[Languages of Kosovo|official languages]] of Kosovo. [[Albania]] has an embassy in the capital [[Pristina]] and Kosovo an embassy in [[Tirana]]. In 1992, Albania was the only country whose parliament voted to recognise the [[Republic of Kosova]]. [[Albania]] was also one of the first countries to officially announce its recognition of the Republic of Kosovo in February 2008.

The [[Global Peace Index]] 2015 ranked Kosovo 69th out of 163 countries. The [[President of Kosovo|President]] holds the title of commander-in-chief of the military.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Law of Kosovo|EULEX}}

[[File:KP-PK During Kosovo Independence Parade.JPG|thumb|The [[Kosovo Police|Kosovan Police]] (''Policia e Kosovës'') is the main law enforcement agency in Kosovo.]]

The judicial system of Kosovo is a civil law system divided between courts with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and administrative courts with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.

The [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.
The declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.

Most of the Kosovo's borders are dominated by mountainous and high terrain. The most noticeable [[Topography|topographical]] features are the [[Albanian Alps]] and the [[Šar Mountains]]. The Albanian Alps, also commonly known as Bjeshkët e Nemuna, are a geological continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The mountains run laterally through the west along the border with Albania and Montenegro. The southeast is predominantly the Šar Mountains, which form the border with North Macedonia. Besides the mountain ranges, Kosovo's territory consists mostly of two major plains: the [[Kosovo Plain]] in the east and the [[Metohija|Metohija Plain]] in the west.

Kosovo's hydrological resources are relatively small. The longest rivers of Kosovo include the [[White Drin]], the [[South Morava]] and the [[Ibar River|Ibar]]. [[Sitnica]], a tributary of Ibar, is the largest river lying completely within Kosovo's territory. River [[Nerodimka (river)|Nerodimka]] represents Europe's only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into the [[Black Sea]] and [[Aegean Sea]].{{Clear}}

The coldest areas of Kosovo are the mountains in the west and southeast, where an alpine climate is found. The warmest areas are mostly in the extreme southern areas close to the border with Albania, characterised by the Mediterranean climate. Mean monthly temperature ranges between {{convert|0|°C|°F|lk=on}} (in January) and {{convert|22|°C|°F|lk=off}} (in July). Mean annual precipitation ranges from {{convert|600|to|1300|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year, and is well distributed year-round.

To the northeast, the [[Kosovo Plain]] and [[Ibar (river)|Ibar Valley]] are drier with total precipitation of about {{convert|600|mm|abbr=off}} per year and more influenced by continental air masses, with colder winters and very hot summers. In the southwest, climatic area of [[Metohija]] receives more mediterranean influences with warmer summers, somewhat higher precipitation ({{convert|700|mm|in|abbr=on}}) and heavy snowfalls in the winter.

Kosovo is divided into seven [[Districts of Kosovo|districts]] ({{lang-sq|rajon}}; {{lang-sr|okrug}}), according to the Law of Kosovo and the Brussels Agreement of 2013, which stipulated the formation of new municipalities with Serb majority populations. The districts are further subdivided into 38 [[Municipalities of Kosovo|municipalities]] (''{{lang|sq|komunë}}''; ''{{lang|sr|opština}}''). The largest and most populous district of Kosovo is the [[District of Pristina]] with the capital in [[Pristina]], having a surface area of {{convert|2470|km2|sqmi|lk=in|sigfig=5}} and a population of 477,312.

Albanians, steadily increasing in number, may have constituted a majority in Kosovo since the 19th century, although the region's historical ethnic composition is disputed.

In the 2011 census, 95.6% of the population of Kosovo was counted as [[Muslim]] and 3.7% as [[Christians|Christian]] including 2.2% as [[Roman Catholic]] and 1.5% as [[Eastern Orthodox]].<ref name=factbook/> The remaining 0.20% of the population reported having no religion, or another religion, or did not provided an adequate answer. Protestants, although recognised as a religious group in Kosovo by the government, were not represented in the census.

[[Islam in Kosovo|Islam]] is the most widely practiced religion in Kosovo and was first introduced in the [[Middle Ages]] by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s.

[[Christianity in Kosovo|Christianity]] has a long and continuous history in Kosovo which can be traced back to the [[State church of the Roman Empire|Roman]] invasion of the region. During the early and late Middle Ages, the entire [[Balkan Peninsula]] had been [[Christianised]] initially by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s and subsequently by the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Followers of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] are predominantly Albanians with ethnic Serbs following the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In 2008, Protestant pastor Artur Krasniqi, primate of the Kosovo Protestant Evangelical Church, claimed that "as many as 15,000" Kosovar Albanians had converted to Protestantism since 1985.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2008/12/30/conversion-rate|title=Conversion rate|date=30 December 2008|work=The Economist|access-date=25 December 2018|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

The relations between the Albanian Muslim and Roman Catholic communities in Kosovo are considered good, however both communities have few or no relations with the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] community. In general, the Albanians of Kosovo define their [[ethnicity]] by [[language]] and not by religion while religion reflects a distinguishing identity feature among the Slavs of Kosovo.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Religion in Kosovo |date=2001 |location=Pristina and Brussels |page=3 |edition=International Crisis Group |language=German}}</ref>

[[File:Kosovo-lignite.jpg|thumb|right|Kosovo has the 5th largest [[lignite]] reserves in the world.]]

The [[economy of Kosovo]] is a transitional economy. It suffered from the combined results of political upheaval, the following [[Yugoslav Wars]], the Serbian dismissal of Kosovo employees and international sanctions on Serbia of which it was then part. Since the independence in 2008, the economy has grown every year. Despite declining foreign assistance, growth of [[GDP]] averaged over 5% a year. This was despite the [[Global financial crisis of 2007-08|global financial crisis of 2009]] and the subsequent [[Eurozone]] crisis. Additionally, the [[inflation rate]] has been low. The most economic development has taken place in the trade, retail and construction sectors. Kosovo is highly dependent on remittances from the [[Albanian diaspora|Diaspora]], [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] and other capital inflows.<ref name="IMF Country Report No 12/100"> '' IMF Country Report No 12/100 '' {{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924054059/http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2012/cr12100.pdf |archivedate=24 September 2015  }} "Unemployment, around 40% of the population, is a significant problem that encourages outward migration and black market activity."</ref>

Currently, there are two main motorways in Kosovo: the [[Albania–Kosovo Highway|R7]] connecting Kosovo with [[Albania]] and the [[R6 Motorway (Kosovo)|R6]] connecting [[Pristina]] with the Macedonian border at [[Elez Han]]. The construction of the new [[R7.1 Motorway (Kosovo)|R7.1 Motorway]] began in 2017.

The [[R7 Motorway (Kosovo)|R7 Motorway]] (part of [[Albania-Kosovo Highway]]) links Kosovo to [[Albania]]'s [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast in [[Durrës]]. Once the remaining [[European route E80|European route (E80)]] from [[Pristina]] to [[Merdare]] section project will be completed, the motorway will link Kosovo through the present [[European route E80|European route (E80)]] highway with the [[Pan-European corridor X]] ([[European route E75|E75]]) near [[Niš]] in Serbia. The [[R6 Motorway (Kosovo)|R6 Motorway]] is currently under construction. Forming part of the [[European route E65|E65]], it is the second motorway constructed in the region and it links the capital [[Pristina]] with the North Macedonian border at [[Elez Han]], which is about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from [[Skopje]]. Construction of the motorway started in 2014 and it is going to be finished in 2018.

The nation hosts two airports, the [[Gjakova Airport]] and the only [[Pristina International Airport|International Airport of Pristina]]. The Gjakova Airport was built by the [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) following the [[Kosovo War]], next to an existing airfield used for agricultural purposes, and was used mainly for military and humanitarian flights.

Education for primary, secondary, and tertiary levels is predominantly public and supported by the state, run by the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Kosovo)|Ministry of Education]]. Education takes place in two main stages: primary and secondary education and higher education.

The primary and secondary education is subdivided into four stages: preschool education, primary and low secondary education, high secondary education and special education. Preschool education is for children from the ages of one to five. Primary and secondary education is obligatory for everyone. It is provided by gymnasiums and vocational schools and also available in languages of recognised minorities in Kosovo, where classes are held in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], Serbian, [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The first phase (primary education) includes grades one to five, and the second phase (low secondary education) grades six to nine. The third phase (high secondary education) consists of general education but also professional education, which is focused on different fields. It lasts four years. However, pupils are offered possibilities of applying for higher or university studies. According to the [[Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Kosovo)|Ministry of Education]], children who are not able to get a general education are able to get a special education (fifth phase).<ref>{{cite web|title=Elementary and secondary education|url=https://www.rks-gov.net/en-US/Qytetaret/Edukimi/Pages/ArsimiFillorDheMesem.aspx|website=rks-gov.net|language=English|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818111807/https://www.rks-gov.net/en-US/Qytetaret/Edukimi/Pages/ArsimiFillorDheMesem.aspx|archivedate=18 August 2016|access-date=14 April 2017}}</ref>

Located at crossroad of [[Albanian people|Albanian]], [[Ottoman people|Ottoman]], [[Italic peoples|Romance]] and [[Slavic people|Slavic]] cultures, Kosovo has enriched its own cuisine adopting and maintaining some of their cooking traditions and techniques.

Food is an important component in the social life of the people of Kosovo particularly during [[religious holiday]]s such as [[Christmas]], [[Easter]] and [[Ramadan]]. For festive occasions, [[Baklava]], [[Lokum]] and [[Halva]] are traditionally prepared in almost every household throughout Kosovo and the [[Balkans]] regardless of ethnicity or cultural identity.<ref>http://rebibneenun.blogdetik.com/embelsira-kosovare/{{Dead link|date=February 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Perhaps the most prominent and traditional examples of Kosovan food include the [[Flia]] and Pite which are served with assorted [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit preserves]], honey and [[yogurt]]. Flia is composed of multiple layered [[crepe]] and is predominantly brushed with cream while Pite are filled with a mixture of salty [[cheese]], [[meat]], [[potato]]es or [[leek]].

The cuisine of Kosovo features a wide range of fresh [[fruit]]s, [[vegetable]]s and [[herb]]s such as [[salt]], [[Bell pepper|red]] and [[black pepper]] and vegeta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.podravka.com/company/markets/kosovo/tab-cuisine-of-kosovo |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528131108/http://www.podravka.com/company/markets/kosovo/tab-cuisine-of-kosovo |archivedate=28 May 2013 |df= }}</ref> The people of Kosovo enjoy a wide variety of meat and [[fish]] products among other [[chicken]], [[beef]], [[kebab]], [[Sujuk|suxhuk]] and [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] which is considered to be the traditional meat for religious occasions due to its religious connections. 
   
[[Tea]] such as Albanian-style [[Sideritis|mountain tea]] or Russian and Turkish-style [[black tea]] are a widely consumed beverage throughout Kosovo and particularly served at cafés, restaurants or at home. [[Coffee]] is another popular drink although Kosovo is steeped in culture and their coffee culture is a big part of the modern society.<ref>{{cite web |title=COFFEE CULTURE IS ROOTED IN OUR SOCIETY |url=http://kosovotwopointzero.com/en/coffee-culture-rooted-society/ |website=kosovotwopointzero.com |language=English}}</ref>

Kosovan art was unknown to the international public for a very long time, because of the regime, many artists were unable to display their art in art galleries, and so were always on the lookout for alternatives, and even resorted to taking matters into their own hands.

The film industry of Kosovo dates from the 1970s. In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.

The International [[Dokufest|Documentary and Short Film Festival]] is the largest film event in Kosovo. The Festival is organised in August in [[Prizren]] which attracts numerous international and regional artists. In this annually organised festival films are screened twice a day in three open air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas. Except for its films, the festival is also well known for lively nights after the screening. Various events happen within the scope of the festival: workshops, DokuPhoto exhibitions, festival camping, concerts, which altogether turn the city into a charming place to be. In 2010 Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.In 2010 Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.<ref>[http://www.dokufest.com/2012/?cid=2,34 Dokufest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820055759/http://www.dokufest.com/2012/?cid=2,34 |date=20 August 2016 }}</ref>

=== Fashion ===

[[Pristina]] is an important fashion design, production and trade hub in the [[Albanian language|Albanian-speaking]] territories. Kosovo has been well documented for its success in global beauty pageantry at [[Miss Universe]]. Furthermore, [[Miss Kosovo]] is a closely followed event throughout the Kosovo. The first titleholder was [[Zana Krasniqi]], who placed as a [[Miss Universe 2008#Results|Top 10]] finalist at the [[Miss Universe 2008|2008 Miss Universe]] pageant. She is the first ever [[Demographics of Kosovo|Kosovo-Albanian]] woman to enter and place in the contest finishing 6th, just two-tenths of a point from the top five. The following year turned out to be another success for the [[Miss Universe Kosovo]] pageant: [[Marigona Dragusha]] placed [[Miss Universe 2009#Results|second runner-up]] to [[Miss Universe 2009]] in the [[Bahamas]] making her to be the first delegate from Kosovo to make it top the top five.

In terms of placements, [[Miss Universe Kosovo|Kosovo]] has been one of the most successful entrants into the [[Miss Universe]] pageant. Ever since debuting in 2008, Kosovo has missed the semi-finals only twice, in 2010 and 2014, beating many countries that have been competing for decades.

Katarina Šulkić from [[Zvečan]] became 2015 [[Miss Serbia]] and [[Anđelka Tomašević]] from [[Zubin Potok]] represented Serbia at the [[Miss Earth 2013]] and [[Miss Universe 2014]].

The '''Federal Republic of Nigeria''', commonly referred to as '''Nigeria'''  ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Nigeria.ogg|n|aɪ|ˈ|dʒ|ɪər|i|ə}}), is a [[Federation|federal]] [[republic]] in [[West Africa]], bordering [[Niger]] in the north, [[Chad]] in the northeast, [[Cameroon]] in the east, and [[Benin]] in the west. Its coast in the south is located on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The [[federation]] comprises [[States of Nigeria|36 states]] and 1 [[Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|Federal Capital Territory]], where the [[Capital city|capital]], [[Abuja]] is located. Nigeria is [[Constitution of Nigeria|officially]] a [[Democracy|democratic]] [[Secular state|secular country]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeria-law.org/ConstitutionOfTheFederalRepublicOfNigeria.htm#Powers_of_Federal_Republic_of_Nigeria|title=Nigerian Constitution|work=Nigeria Law|accessdate=17 July 2015}}</ref>

Nigeria has been home to a number of ancient and indigenous kingdoms and states over the millennia. The modern state originated from [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonial rule]] beginning in the 19th century, and took its present territorial shape with the merging of the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] and [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] in 1914. The British set up administrative and legal structures while practising [[indirect rule]] through traditional [[chiefdoms]]. Nigeria became a formally independent federation in 1960. It experienced a [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war]] from 1967 to 1970. It thereafter alternated between democratically elected civilian governments and military dictatorships until it achieved a stable democracy in 1999, with the [[Nigerian presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential election]] considered the first to be reasonably free and fair.<ref name = "New York"/>

Nigeria is often referred to as the "Giant of Africa", owing to its [[Demographics of Nigeria|large population]] and economy.<ref name =giant>''Nigeria: Giant of Africa,'' by Peter Holmes 1987</ref> With {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Nigeria}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million inhabitants, Nigeria is the [[List of African countries by population|most populous country in Africa]] and the [[list of countries by population|seventh most populous country in the world]].

== Etymology ==
The name ''[[Wikt:Nigeria|Nigeria]]'' was taken from the [[Niger River]] running through the country. This name was coined in the late 19th century by British journalist [[Flora Shaw, Lady Lugard|Flora Shaw]], who later married [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Lord Lugard]], a [[British Empire|British colonial]] administrator. The origin of the name ''Niger'', which originally applied only to the middle reaches of the Niger River, is uncertain. The word is likely an alteration of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] name ''egerew <u>n-iger</u>ewen''  used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around [[Timbuktu]] prior to 19th-century European colonialism.<ref>The Arabic name ''nahr al-anhur'' is a direct translation of the Tuareg.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Niger |title=''Online Etymological Dictionary'' |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>

Oyo, at its territorial zenith in the late 17th to early 18th centuries, extended its influence from western Nigeria to modern-day [[Togo]]. The Edo's [[Benin Empire]] is located in southwestern Nigeria. Benin's power lasted between the 15th and 19th centuries. Their dominance reached as far as the city of Eko (an [[Edo language|Edo]] name later changed to [[Lagos]] by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]]) and further.<ref>{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Helen Chapin|title=Nigeria: A Country Study – The Slave Trade|publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]|year=1991|url=http://countrystudies.us/nigeria/7.htm|accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 19th century, [[Usman dan Fodio]] directed a successful ''[[jihad]]'' and created and led the centralised [[Fulani Empire]] (also known as the [[Sokoto Caliphate]]). The territory controlled by the resultant state included much of modern-day northern and central Nigeria; it lasted until the 1903 break-up of the Empire into various European colonies.

For centuries, various peoples in modern-day Nigeria traded overland with traders from North Africa. Cities in the area became regional centres in a broad network of trade routes that spanned western, central and northern Africa. In the 16th century, [[Portuguese explorers]] were the first Europeans to begin significant, direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria, at the port they named [[Lagos]] and in [[Calabar]]. Europeans traded goods with peoples at the coast; coastal trade with Europeans also marked the beginnings of the [[Atlantic slave trade]].<ref name="diverse-slavery">{{cite book |first=April A. |last=Gordon |title=Nigeria's Diverse Peoples: A Reference Sourcebook |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year= 2003 |pages=44–54 |isbn=978-1-57607-682-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H26pO3vwmHoC&pg=PA54 |access-date=29 March 2015}}</ref> The port of Calabar on the historical [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] (now commonly referred to as the Bight of Bonny) became one of the largest slave trading posts in West Africa in the era of the transatlantic slave trade.

The use of slave labor was extensive, especially in agriculture."<ref>Kevin Shillington (2005). ''[[Encyclopedia of African History]]''. Michigan University Press. p. 1401. {{ISBN|1-57958-455-1}}</ref>

A changing legal imperative (transatlantic slave trade outlawed by Britain in 1807) and economic imperative (a desire for political and social stability) led most European powers to support widespread cultivation of agricultural products, such as the palm, for use in European industry.

The slave trade was engaged in by European state and non-state actors such as [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Portugal]] and private companies, as well as various African states and non-state actors. With rising anti-slavery sentiment at home and changing economic realities, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] outlawed the international slave trade in 1807. Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Great Britain established the [[West Africa Squadron]] in an attempt to halt the international traffic in slaves.<ref>{{cite news|title=10 things about British slavery|publisher=BBC News|date=3 August 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4742049.stm|accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref> It stopped ships of other nations that were leaving the African coast with slaves; the seized slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akintoye|Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland. In 1864, [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]] became the first African [[Church of Nigeria|bishop of the Anglican Church]].

In 1885, British claims to a West African [[sphere of influence]] received recognition from other European nations at the [[Berlin Conference]]. The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.

In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]]. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.

Christian missions established Western educational institutions in the Protectorates. Under Britain's policy of indirect rule and validation of Islamic tradition, the Crown did not encourage the operation of Christian missions in the northern, Islamic part of the country.<ref>Garba, Safiya J., "[http://www.mcser.org/images/stories/JESR-Special-Issues/JESR%202012%20Special%20Issue%20vol%202%20no%207/Safiya%20J%20Garba.pdf The Impact of Colonialism on Nigerian Education and the Need for E-Learning Technique for Sustainable Development]", ''Journal of Education and Social Research,'' MCSER-Mediterranean Center of Social and Educational Research (Rome; Vol. 2 (7) October 2012); p. 56 ({{ISSN|2239-978X}})</ref> Some children of the southern elite went to Great Britain to pursue higher education. By independence in 1960, regional differences in modern educational access were marked. The legacy, though less pronounced, continues to the present day. Imbalances between North and South were expressed in Nigeria's political life as well. For instance, northern Nigeria did not outlaw [[African slave trade|slavery]] until 1936 whilst in other parts of Nigeria slavery was abolished soon after colonialism.<ref>{{cite web|title=The end of slavery|work=The Story of Africa|publisher=BBC News|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/page56.shtml|accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref>

Following [[World War II]], in response to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence, successive constitutions legislated by the British government moved Nigeria toward [[self-government]] on a representative and increasingly federal basis. By the middle of the 20th century, a great [[Decolonization of Africa|wave for independence]] was sweeping across Africa. Nigeria achieved independence in 1960.

=== Independent Federation and First Republic (1960–1966) ===
The [[Federation of Nigeria]] gained independence from the [[United Kingdom]] on 1 October 1960, while retaining the [[British monarch]], [[Elizabeth II]], as nominal head of state and [[Queen of Nigeria]]. Nigeria's government was a coalition of conservative parties: the [[National Party of Nigeria|Nigerian People's Congress]] (NPC), a party dominated by Northerners and those of the Islamic faith, and the Igbo and Christian-dominated [[National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons]] (NCNC) led by [[Nnamdi Azikiwe]]. Azikiwe replaced the colonial [[governor-general]] in November 1960. The opposition comprised the comparatively liberal [[Action Group (Nigeria)|Action Group]] (AG), which was largely dominated by the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and led by [[Obafemi Awolowo]].<ref name=JBS>{{cite journal|title=Nigerian Political Parties: Their Role in Modernizing the Political System, 1920–1966|author=Udofia, O.E. |journal=Journal of Black Studies|volume=11|issue=4 |year=1981|pages=435–447|doi=10.1177/002193478101100404 |jstor=2784073}}</ref> The cultural and political differences between Nigeria's dominant ethnic groups – the Hausa ('Northerners'), Igbo ('Easterners') and Yoruba ('Westerners') – were sharp.

An imbalance was created in the polity by the result of the [[Southern Cameroons#Trust territory|1961 plebiscite]]. [[Southern Cameroons]] opted to join the Republic of Cameroon while [[Northern Cameroons]] chose to remain in Nigeria. The northern part of the country was now far larger than the southern part. In 1963, the nation established a [[Federal Republic]], with Azikiwe as its first [[President of Nigeria|president]]. When elections were held in 1965, the [[Nigerian National Democratic Party]] came to power in Nigeria's Western Region.

=== Civil war (1967–1970) ===
{{Main|Nigerian Civil War}}
[[File:Biafra independent state map-en.svg|thumb|The Republic of Biafra in June 1967, when it declared its independence from the rest of Nigeria]]
The disequilibrium and perceived corruption of the electoral and political process led, in 1966, to back-to-back [[military coup]]s. The [[1966 Nigerian coup d'état|first coup was in January 1966]] and was led mostly by Igbo soldiers under Majors [[Emmanuel Ifeajuna]] and [[Chukwuma Kaduna Nzeogwu]]. The coup plotters succeeded in assassinating [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa|Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]], [[Ahmadu Bello|Premier Ahmadu Bello]] of the Northern Region and Premier Ladoke Akintola of the Western Region. But, the coup plotters struggled to form a central government. President Nwafor Orizu handed over government control to the Army, then under the command of another Igbo officer, [[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi|General JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi]].

Later, [[Nigerian Counter-Coup of 1966|the counter-coup of 1966]], supported primarily by Northern military officers, facilitated the rise of Lt. Colonel [[Yakubu Gowon]] to head of state. Tension rose between North and South; [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom|Igbos in Northern cities suffered persecution]] and many fled to the Eastern Region.

In May 1967, the Eastern Region declared independence as a state called the [[Republic of Biafra]], under the leadership of Lt. Colonel [[Emeka Ojukwu]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Murray|first=Senan|title=Reopening Nigeria's civil war wounds|publisher=BBC News|date=30 May 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6657259.stm|accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref> The [[Nigerian Civil War]] began as the official Nigerian government side attacked Biafra on 6 July 1967 at Garkem.

France, Egypt, the Soviet Union, Britain, Israel, and others were deeply involved in the civil war behind the scenes. Britain and the Soviet Union were the main military backers of the Nigerian government while France and others aided the Biafrans. Nigeria used Egyptian pilots for their air force.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.litencyc.com/theliterarymagazine/biafra.php |title=''The Biafra War and the Age of Pestilence'' |publisher=Litencyc.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref><ref>Michael I.

=== Military juntas (1970–1999) ===

[[File:Obasanjo 1978.gif|thumb|right|upright|[[Olusegun Obasanjo]] was a military president who ruled the country from 1976 to 1979.]]
During the [[oil boom]] of the 1970s, Nigeria joined [[OPEC]] and the huge oil revenues it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve the standard of living of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to [[federalism]] in Nigeria.<ref>Watts, Michael (1987) ''State, Oil and Agriculture in Nigeria'', Institute of International Studies, University of California, {{ISBN|0-87725-166-5}}.</ref>

Beginning in 1979, Nigerians participated in a return to democracy when [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] transferred power to the civilian regime of [[Shehu Shagari]]. The Shagari government became viewed as corrupt by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society. In 1983 the inspectors of the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) began to notice "the slow poisoning of the waters of this country".<ref name=igbo>

</ref>{{Self-published inline|date=December 2017}}   The military coup of [[Muhammadu Buhari]] shortly after the regime's re-election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development.<ref>"Nigeria, Military Faces Daunting Challenges", AP Press International, 3 March 1984.

His regime was overthrown by another military coup in 1985.<ref name=Globe>"Nigeria stays calms as leader toppled in bloodless coup", ''The Globe and Mail'', 28 August 1985. Retrieved 22 February 2007.</ref>

The new head of state, [[Ibrahim Babangida]], declared himself president and commander in chief of the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a flurry of political activity: he instituted the [[International Monetary Fund]]'s Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organization of the Islamic Conference]], which aggravated religious tensions in the country.<ref name= AP>Holman, Michael (24 February 1986) "Nigeria, Politics; Religious Differences Intensify", ''Financial Times''</ref>

Babangida survived an abortive coup, then postponed a promised return to democracy to 1992. Free and fair elections{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for [[Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola]] of the [[Social Democratic Party (Nigeria)|Social Democratic Party]], who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating [[Bashir Tofa]] of the [[National Republican Convention]].<ref>[http://africanelections.tripod.com/ng.html Elections in Nigeria] at African Elections Database</ref> However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading to massive civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks.

In late 1993 Shonekan's caretaker regime was overwhelmed by the military coup of General [[Sani Abacha]], who used military force on a wide scale to suppress the continuing civilian unrest. He shifted money to offshore accounts in western European banks and defeated coup plots by bribing army generals. In 1995 the government hanged environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa on trumped-up charges in the deaths of four [[Ogoni]] elders. Lawsuits under the American [[Alien Tort Statute]] against [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and Brian Anderson, the head of Shell's Nigerian operation, settled out of court with Shell continuing to deny liability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiwavshell.org/|title=Wiwa et al v. Royal Dutch Petroleum et al.|work=Center for Constitutional Rights}}</ref>

Several hundred million dollars in accounts traced to Abacha were discovered in 1999.<ref>''"Nigerian Lawyer: Abacha accounts apparently in Switzerland, Luxembourg, France, and Germany", AP press, 10 January 2000.''</ref> The regime came to an end in 1998, when the dictator died in the villa. His successor, General [[Abdulsalami Abubakar]], adopted a new constitution on 5 May 1999, which provided for multiparty elections. On 29 May 1999 Abubakar transferred power to the winner of the elections, Obasanjo, who had since retired from the military.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/2391/Abdusalam-Abubakar "Abdusalam Abubakar"], Encyclopædia Britannica Online, accessed 26 October 2012.</ref>

=== Democratisation (1999–) ===
[[File:NewYam-IgboFestival-Dublin.jpg|thumb|right|Igbo people celebrating the [[New Yam Festival of the Igbo|New Yam festival]], UzomediaTV ]]
Nigeria regained democracy in 1999 when it elected [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], the former military head of state, as the new [[President of Nigeria]]. This ended almost 33 years of military rule (from 1966 until 1999), excluding the short-lived [[Second Nigerian Republic|second republic]] (between 1979 and 1983) by military dictators who seized power in [[coup d'état|coups d'état]] and counter-coups during the [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1998]]. Although the elections that brought Obasanjo to power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development.

[[Conflict in the Niger Delta|Ethnic violence for control over the oil-producing Niger Delta]] region and inadequate infrastructures are some of the issues in the country. [[Umaru Yar'Adua]] of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party (PDP)]] came into power in the [[Nigerian general election, 2007|general election of 2007]]. The international community has been observing Nigerian elections to encourage a free and fair process, and condemned this one as being severely flawed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eueom-ng.org/Files/final_report.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032839/http://www.eueom-ng.org/Files/final_report.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 February 2008 |title=Final Report |publisher=EU Election Observation Mission Nigeria 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2008 }}</ref>

Goodluck Jonathan served as Nigeria's president until 16 April 2011, when a new [[Nigerian presidential election, 2011|presidential election in Nigeria]] was conducted. Jonathan of the PDP was declared the winner on 19 April 2011, having won the election with a total of 22,495,187 of the 39,469,484 votes cast, to stand ahead of [[Muhammadu Buhari]] from the main opposition party, the [[Congress for Progressive Change|Congress for Progressive Change (CPC)]], which won 12,214,853 of the total votes cast.<ref name=cnn>{{cite web|last=Purefoy |first=Christian |title=Goodluck Jonathan retains Nigerian presidency |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-18/world/nigeria.elections_1_illegal-voting-muhammadu-buhari-kaduna?_s=PM:WORLD |publisher=CNN |accessdate=11 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422075252/http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-18/world/nigeria.elections_1_illegal-voting-muhammadu-buhari-kaduna?_s=PM%3AWORLD |archivedate=22 April 2011 |df= }}</ref>

Despite the economic slow down in the country [[Muhammadu Buhari]] was re-elected in February 2019 for a second term.

The president's power is checked by a [[Nigerian Senate|Senate]] and a [[House of Representatives of Nigeria|House of Representatives]], which are combined in a [[Bicameralism|bicameral body]] called the [[National Assembly of Nigeria|National Assembly]]. The Senate is a 109-seat body with three members from each state and one from the capital region of Abuja; members are elected by popular vote to four-year terms. The House contains 360 seats, with the number of seats per state is determined by population.<ref name="factbook">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html |title=Nigeria |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] (United States) |work=[[The World Factbook]]}}</ref>

Ethnocentrism, tribalism, religious persecution, and [[prebendalism]] have affected Nigerian politics both prior and subsequent to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism has made its way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests.<ref>[[Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi]], who served briefly as Nigeria's second president, devoted his government to combating this phenomenon with Decree 33, which banned 81 political parties and 26 tribal and cultural organizations in the name of national unity. See Osaghae, ''The Crippled Giant: Nigeria Since Independence'', Indiana University Press, 1998, p. 57. {{ISBN|0-253-21197-2}}.</ref> Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as [[MASSOB]], Nationalist movements such as [[Oodua Peoples Congress]], [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] and a [[Nigerian civil war|civil war]]. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.<ref name=rashid>{{cite journal |last1 = Rashid |first1 = Khadijat K. |year = 2003 |title = Ethnicity and Sub-Nationalism in Nigeria: Movement for a Mid-West State/Ethnic Politics in Kenya and Nigeria/Federalism and Ethnic Conflict in Nigeria |url = |journal = African Studies Review |volume = 46 |issue = 2}}</ref>

Because of the above issues, Nigeria's political parties are [[pan-nationalism|pan-national]] and secular in character (though this does not preclude the continuing preeminence of the dominant ethnicities).<ref name=rashid/><ref>{{cite web |last=Lancia |first=Nicole |url=http://www12.georgetown.edu/students/organizations/nscs/capitalscholar/lancia2.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208073259/http://www12.georgetown.edu/students/organizations/nscs/capitalscholar/lancia2.html |archivedate=8 February 2012 |title=Ethnic Politics in Nigeria: The Realities of Regionalism |publisher=[[Georgetown University]] |accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref> The two major political parties are the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party of Nigeria]] and the [[All Progressives Congress]]. About twenty minor opposition parties are registered.

The then-president, [[Olusegun Obasanjo]], acknowledged fraud and other electoral "lapses" but said the result reflected opinion polls. In a national television address in 2007, he added that if Nigerians did not like the victory of his handpicked successor, they would have an opportunity to vote again in four years.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreal |first=Chris |url=https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,,2064068,00.html |title=Ruling party named winner in disputed Nigerian election |work=The Guardian|date= 24 April 2007|accessdate=21 November 2008 |location=London}}</ref>

In the [[Nigerian general election, 2015]], the victorious [[All Progressives Congress]] has 225 House seats and 60 in the Senate while the defeated [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party of Nigeria]] became the opposition with 125 seats in the House and 49 in the Senate.

As in many other African societies, [[prebendalism]] and high rates of corruption continue to constitute major challenges to Nigeria. All major parties have practised vote-rigging and other means of coercion to remain competitive.

=== Law ===
{{Main|Law of Nigeria}}

There are three distinct systems of law in Nigeria:
* [[Common law]], derived from its British colonial past, and a development of its own after independence;
* [[Customary law]], derived from indigenous traditional norms and practice, including the dispute resolution meetings of pre-colonial Yorubaland secret societies and the [[Egbo|Ẹ̀kpẹ̀]] and Ọ̀kọ́ńkọ̀ of [[Igboland]] and [[Ibibio people|Ibibioland]];
* [[Sharia]] law, used only in the predominantly Muslim northern states of the country. It is an Islamic legal system that had been used long before the colonial administration. In late 1999, [[Zamfara State|Zamfara]] emphasised its use, with eleven other northern states following suit.

{{Main|Foreign relations of Nigeria}}

[[File:MinForeignAffairs.jpg|thumb|The Ministry of [[Foreign Affairs]], [[Abuja]]]]

Upon gaining independence in 1960, Nigeria made African unity the centrepiece of its foreign policy and played a leading role in the fight against the [[apartheid]] government in South Africa.<ref>Young, Andrew (20 July 2006) [http://allafrica.com/stories/200607200078.html "Collins Edomaruse, how Obasanjo cut UK, US to size"], ''This Day'' (Nigeria).</ref> One notable exception to the African focus was Nigeria's close relationship developed with [[Israel]] throughout the 1960s. The latter nation sponsored and oversaw the construction of Nigeria's parliament buildings.<ref>Burkett, Elinor (2009) ''Golda'', HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0-06-187395-0}}, p. 202.</ref>

Nigeria's foreign policy was tested in the 1970s after the country emerged united from its own civil war. It supported movements against white minority governments in the Southern Africa sub-region. Nigeria backed the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) by taking a committed tough line with regard to the South African government and their military actions in southern Africa. Nigeria was also a founding member of the [[Organisation for African Unity]] (now the [[African Union]]), and has tremendous influence in West Africa and Africa on the whole. Nigeria has additionally founded regional cooperative efforts in West Africa, functioning as standard-bearer for the [[Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and [[ECOMOG]], economic and military organizations, respectively.

With this Africa-centred stance, Nigeria readily sent troops to the [[Congo Crisis|Congo]] at the behest of the United Nations shortly after independence (and has maintained membership since that time). Nigeria also supported several Pan-African and pro-self government causes in the 1970s, including garnering support for [[Angola]]'s [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola|MPLA]], [[SWAPO]] in Namibia, and aiding opposition to the minority governments of [[Mozambican War of Independence|Portuguese Mozambique]], and [[Rhodesian Bush War|Rhodesia]].

Nigeria retains membership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. In late November 2006, it organised an Africa-South America Summit in [[Abuja]] to promote what some attendees termed "South-South" linkages on a variety of fronts.<ref>{{cite web|title=ASAS – Africa-South America Summit |publisher=[[African Union]] |date=30 November 2006 |url=http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/Past/2006/November/SummitASA/summit.htm |accessdate=29 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518172006/http://www.africa-union.org/root/au/Conferences/Past/2006/November/SummitASA/summit.htm |archivedate=18 May 2011 |df= }}</ref> Nigeria is also a member of the [[International Criminal Court]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It was temporarily expelled from the latter in 1995 when ruled by the [[Sani Abacha|Abacha regime]].

Nigeria has remained a key player in the [[Petroleum industry|international oil industry]] since the 1970s, and maintains membership in [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]] (OPEC), which it joined in July 1971. Its [[Petroleum in Nigeria|status as a major petroleum producer]] figures prominently in its sometimes volatile international relations with both [[developed countries]], notably the United States, and the developing countries of China, [[Jamaica]], and [[Ghana]] and [[Kenya]] in Africa.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Timothy, Shaw |title=The State of Nigeria: Oil Prices Power Bases and Foreign Policy|journal= Canadian Journal of African Studies|volume=18|issue=2|year= 1984|pages= 393–405|jstor=484337|doi=10.2307/484337}}</ref>

Millions of Nigerians have emigrated during times of economic hardship, primarily to Europe, North America and Australia. It is estimated that over a million Nigerians have emigrated to the United States and constitute the [[Nigerian American]] populace. Individuals in many such Diasporic communities have joined the "Egbe Omo Yoruba" society, a national association of Yoruba descendants in North America.<ref>{{cite web|title=Egbe Omo Yoruba, National Association of Yoruba descendants in North America|publisher=yorubanation.org|date=19 May 2007|url=http://www.yorubanation.org|accessdate=29 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309144042/http://www.yorubanation.org/#|archive-date=9 March 2018|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

The Nigerian military are charged with protecting the Federal Republic of Nigeria, promoting Nigeria's global security interests, and supporting peacekeeping efforts, especially in West Africa. This is in support of the doctrine sometimes called [[Pax Nigeriana]].

The Nigerian Military consist of an [[Nigerian Army|army]], a [[Nigerian Navy|navy]], and an [[Nigerian Air Force|air force]].<ref name="factbook"/> The military in Nigeria have played a major role in the country's history since independence. Various juntas have seized control of the country and ruled it through most of its history. Its last period of military rule ended in 1999 following the sudden death of former dictator [[Sani Abacha]] in 1998. His successor, [[Abdulsalam Abubakar]], handed over power to the democratically-elected government of [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] the next year.

As Africa's most populated country, Nigeria has repositioned its military as a peacekeeping force on the continent. Since 1995, the Nigerian military, through [[ECOMOG]] mandates, have been deployed as peacekeepers in [[Liberia]] (1997), [[Ivory Coast]] (1997–1999), and [[Sierra Leone]] (1997–1999).<ref name=Press>O'Loughlin, Ed (11 March 1998) [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/nigerians-outshine-the-british-brass-1149561.html "Nigerians outshine the British brass"], ''The Independent (London)''</ref> Under an [[African Union]] mandate, it has stationed forces in [[Sudan]]'s [[Darfur conflict|Darfur]] region to try to establish [[peace]].

The highest point in Nigeria is [[Chappal Waddi]] at {{convert|2419|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The main rivers are the [[Niger River|Niger]] and the [[Benue River|Benue]], which converge and empty into the [[Niger Delta]]. This is one of the world's largest river deltas, and the location of a large area of Central African [[mangrove]]s.

Nigeria has a varied landscape.

Nigeria's most expansive topographical region is that of the valleys of the Niger and Benue river valleys (which merge into each other and form a "y" shape).<ref name="encarta"/> To the southwest of the Niger is "rugged" [[Highland (geography)|highland]]. To the southeast of the Benue are hills and mountains, which form the [[Mambilla Plateau]], the highest plateau in Nigeria. This plateau extends through the border with [[Cameroon]], where the [[montane]] land is part of the [[Bamenda Highlands]] of Cameroon.

The area near the border with Cameroon close to the coast is rich rainforest and part of the [[Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]], an important centre for [[biodiversity]]. It is habitat for the [[drill (mammal)|drill monkey]], which is found in the wild only in this area and across the border in Cameroon. The areas surrounding [[Calabar]], Cross River State, also in this forest, are believed to contain the world's largest diversity of [[butterflies]]. The area of southern Nigeria between the [[River Niger|Niger]] and the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross Rivers]] has lost most of its forest because of development and harvesting by increased population, with it being replaced by [[grassland]] (''see [[Cross-Niger transition forests]]'').

Everything in between the far south and the far north is [[savannah]] (insignificant tree cover, with grasses and flowers located between trees). Rainfall is more limited, to between {{convert|20|and|60|in|mm|-2|order=flip}} per year.<ref name=gai5/> The savannah zone's three categories are [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]], Sudan savannah, and [[Sahel]] savannah.  Guinean forest-savanna mosaic is plains of tall grass interrupted by trees. Sudan savannah is similar but with shorter grasses and shorter trees. Sahel savannah consists of patches of grass and sand, found in the northeast.<ref name=gai4/> In the Sahel region, rain is less than {{convert|20|in|mm|sigfig=1|order=flip}} per year and the [[Sahara Desert]] is encroaching.<ref name=gai5/> In the dry northeast corner of the country lies [[Lake Chad]], which Nigeria shares with [[Niger]], Chad and Cameroon.

[[Waste management]] including [[sewage treatment]], the linked processes of [[deforestation]] and [[soil degradation]], and [[climate change]] or [[global warming]] are the major environmental problems in Nigeria. Waste management presents problems in a [[mega city]] like Lagos and other major Nigerian cities which are linked with [[economic development]], [[population growth]] and the inability of [[municipal council]]s to manage the resulting rise in industrial and domestic waste. This huge waste management problem is also attributable to unsustainable environmental management lifestyles of [[Kubwa, Abuja|Kubwa]] Community in the Federal Capital Territory, where there are habits of indiscriminate disposal of waste, dumping of waste along or into the [[canal]]s, sewerage systems that are channels for water flows, and the like.

Haphazard industrial planning, increased [[urbanisation]], [[poverty]] and lack of competence of the municipal government are seen as the major reasons for high levels of waste pollution in major cities of the country. Some of the 'solutions' have been disastrous to the environment, resulting in untreated waste being dumped in places where it can pollute [[waterway]]s and [[groundwater]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=D.N. |last=Ogbonna |first2=I.K.E. |last2=Ekweozor |first3=F.U. |last3=Igwe |title=Waste Management: A Tool for Environmental Protection in Nigeria |journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment |volume=31 |issue=1 |year=2002 |pages=55–57 |jstor=4315211 |doi=10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0055:wmatfe]2.0.co;2}}</ref>

In 2005 Nigeria had the highest rate of [[deforestation]] in the world, according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] (FAO).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2005/1117-forests.html |title=News.mongabay.com |publisher=News.mongabay.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref> That year, 12.2%, the equivalent of 11,089,000 hectares had been forested in the country. Between 1990 and 2000, Nigeria lost an average of 409,700 hectares of forest every year equal to an average annual deforestation rate of 2.4%. Between 1990 and 2005, in total Nigeria lost 35.7% of its [[forest cover]], or around 6,145,000 hectares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Nigeria.htm |title=Rainforest analysis at Mongabay.com |publisher=Rainforests.mongabay.com |date=1 January 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, thousands of people were inadvertently exposed to [[lead]]-containing soil / ore from informal [[gold mining]] within the northern state of [[Zamfara State lead poisoning epidemic|Zamfara]].

Previously, economic development had been hindered by years of [[military dictatorship|military rule]], corruption, and mismanagement. The restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential. {{As of|2014}} it is the largest economy in Africa, having overtaken South Africa.

During the [[OPEC|oil boom]] of the 1970s, Nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigeria authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30&nbsp;billion) owed to the Paris Club.

Nigeria is trying to reach the first of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which is to [[Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere|end poverty]] in all its forms by 2030.

Nigeria is the 12th largest producer of petroleum in the world and the 8th largest exporter, and has the 10th largest proven reserves. (The country joined [[OPEC]] in 1971). [[Petroleum in Nigeria|Petroleum]] plays a large role in the Nigerian economy, accounting for 40% of GDP and 80% of Government earnings.

=== Government satellites ===
The Nigerian government has commissioned the overseas production and launch of four satellites. The Nigeriasat-1 was the first satellite to be built under the Nigerian government sponsorship. The satellite was launched from [[Russia]] on 27 September 2003. Nigeriasat-1 was part of the worldwide Disaster Monitoring Constellation System.<ref name="nairaland.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nairaland.com/nigeria/topic-192.0.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726152137/http://www.nairaland.com/nigeria/topic-192.0.html |archivedate=26 July 2011 |title=Nigeria has a Satellite in Orbit! (NigeriaSat-1) |publisher=Nairaland |date=9 May 2005}}</ref> The primary objectives of the Nigeriasat-1 were: to give early warning signals of environmental disaster; to help detect and control [[desertification]] in the northern part of Nigeria; to assist in [[demographic]] planning; to establish the relationship between [[malaria]] vectors and the environment that breeds malaria and to give early warning signals on future outbreaks of [[meningitis]] using remote sensing technology; to provide the technology needed to bring education to all parts of the country through distant learning; and to aid in conflict resolution and border disputes by mapping out state and International borders.

NigeriaSat-2, Nigeria's second satellite, was built as a high-resolution earth satellite by Surrey Space Technology Limited, a [[United Kingdom]]-based satellite technology company. It has 2.5-metre resolution panchromatic (very high resolution), 5-metre multispectral (high resolution, NIR red, green and red bands), and 32-metre multispectral (medium resolution, NIR red, green and red bands) antennas, with a ground receiving station in [[Abuja]]. The NigeriaSat-2 spacecraft alone was built at a cost of over £35 million. This satellite was launched into [[orbit]] from a military base in China.<ref name="nairaland.com"/>

[[NigComSat-1]], a Nigerian satellite built in 2004, was Nigeria's third satellite and Africa's first communication satellite. It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese [[Long March 3B]] [[carrier rocket]], from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Centre]] in [[China]]. The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]]. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It was based on the Chinese [[DFH-4]] [[satellite bus]], and carries a variety of [[transponder]]s: 4 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]]; 14 [[Ku-band]]; 8 [[Ka-band]]; and 2 [[L-band]]. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.

On 10 November 2008 (0900 GMT), the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites. According to Nigerian Communications Satellite Limited, it was put into "emergency mode operation in order to effect mitigation and repairs".<ref>{{cite news|title='Technical problems' shut down Nigerian satellite |agency=AFP |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g4S4e2LVeoER0jCP79S0gw3tjp7A |date=12 November 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104051741/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5g4S4e2LVeoER0jCP79S0gw3tjp7A |archivedate=4 January 2011}}</ref> The satellite eventually failed after losing power on 11 November 2008.

On 24 March 2009, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, NigComSat Ltd. and CGWIC signed another contract for the in-orbit delivery of the NigComSat-1R satellite. NigComSat-1R was also a DFH-4 satellite, and the replacement for the failed NigComSat-1 was successfully launched into orbit by China in Xichang on 19 December 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgwic.com/In-OrbitDelivery/CommunicationsSatellite/Program/NigComSat-1.html|title=Nigcomsat-1 Program – In-Orbit Delivery Program  –  Communications Satellite  –  CGWIC|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cgwic.com/In-OrbitDelivery/CommunicationsSatellite/Program/NigComSat-1.html |title=Nigcomsat-1 Program – In-Orbit Delivery Program – Communications Satellite |publisher=CGWIC |accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref> The satellite, according to then-Nigerian President [[Goodluck Jonathan]], was paid for by the insurance policy on NigComSat-1, which de-orbited in 2009.

Nigeria has more than 250 ethnic groups, with varying languages and customs, creating a country of rich ethnic diversity. The largest ethnic groups are the [[Hausa people|Hausa]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]], together accounting for more than 70% of the population, while the [[Urhobo people|Urhobo-Isoko]], [[Edo (ethnic group)|Edo]], [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], [[Ebira people|Ebira]], [[Nupe people|Nupe]], [[Gbagyi people|Gbagyi]], [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]], [[Igala people|Igala]], [[Idoma people|Idoma]] and [[Tiv people|Tiv]] comprise between 25 and 30%; other minorities make up the remaining 5%.<ref name=NGeo>"Nigeria" in ''Geographica: The complete Atlas of the world'', Random House, 2002, {{ISBN|0-375-72037-5}}</ref>

The middle belt of Nigeria is known for its diversity of ethnic groups, including the Pyem, Goemai, and [[Kofyar]]. The official population count of each of Nigeria's ethnicities has always remained controversial and disputed as members of different ethnic groups believe the census is rigged to give a particular group (usually believed to be northern groups) numerical superiority.<ref name="felix"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Growing Apart: Oil, Politics, and Economic Change in Indonesia and Nigeria |first=Peter |last=Lewis |page=132 |publisher=University of Michigan Press |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-472-06980-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=T4-rlVeb1n0C&pg=PA132}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Federalism and Ethnic Conflict in Nigeria |first=Rotimi T. |last=Suberu |publisher=US Institute of Peace Press |year=2001 |page=154 |isbn=978-1-929223-28-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WKeUMmDlPkEC&pg=PA154}}</ref>

[[File:Nigeria linguistical map 1979.svg|thumb|upright=1.45|right|Map of Nigeria's linguistic groups]]

There are 521 languages that have been spoken in Nigeria; nine of them are now extinct.

In some areas of Nigeria, ethnic groups speak more than one language. The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.

Many French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.  Most of the population speaks English as their native language.

The major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] and [[Fulfulde]]; [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family; and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.

Even though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself (Igbo, Hausa and Yoruba) but unlike the Yorubas and Igbos, the Hausas tend not to travel far outside Nigeria itself.

With the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as "[[Pidgin]]" or "Broken" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>

Nigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Islam]] and [[Islam|Christianity]] being the most widely professed religions. Nigerians are nearly equally divided into [[Muslim]]s and [[Muslims|Christians]], with a tiny minority of adherents of [[Animism]] and other religions.

Islam dominates North Western (Hausa, Fulani and others) and a good portion of Northern Eastern (Kanuri, Fulani and other groups) Nigeria. It also has a number of adherents in the South Western, [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] part of the country. Nigeria has the largest Muslim population in sub-Saharan Africa. [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and locally cultivated [[Christianity]] are also widely practiced in Western areas, while [[Roman Catholicism]] is a more prominent Christian feature of South Eastern Nigeria. Both Protestantism and Roman Catholicism are observed in the [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]], [[Annang]], [[Efik people|Efik]] and [[Ijaw people|Ijo]] lands of the south.

The 1963 census indicated that 47% of Nigerians were Muslim, 35% Christian, and 18% members of [[African religion|local indigenous congregations]]. If accurate, this indicated a sharp increase since 1953 in the number of Christians (up 23%); a decline among those professing indigenous beliefs, compared with 20%; and only a modest (6%) drop of Muslims which can likely be attributed to immigration, emigration, and birthrate.

The vast majority of [[Islam in Nigeria|Muslims in Nigeria]] are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] belonging to [[Maliki]] school of [[jurisprudence]]; however, a sizeable minority also belongs to [[Shafi]] [[madhhab]]. A large number of [[Sunni Muslim]]s are members of [[Sufi]] brotherhoods. Most Sufis follow the [[Qadiriyya]], [[Tijaniyyah]] and/or the [[Mouride]] movements. A significant [[Shia]] minority exists (''see [[Shia in Nigeria]]''). Some northern states have incorporated [[Sharia]] law into their previously secular legal systems, which has brought about some controversy.<ref name=tiptoe>Owobi Angrew, "Tiptoeing Through A Constitutional Minefield: The Great Sharia Controversy in Nigeria", ''[[Journal of African Law]]'', Vol. 48, No 2, 2002.</ref> [[Kano State]] has sought to incorporate Sharia law into its constitution.<ref>{{cite web

The Nigerian health care system is continuously faced with a shortage of doctors known as '[[brain drain]]', because of emigration by skilled Nigerian doctors to North America and Europe. In 1995, it was estimated that 21,000 Nigerian doctors were practising in the United States alone, which is about the same as the number of doctors working in the Nigerian public service. Retaining these expensively trained professionals has been identified as one of the goals of the government.<ref>{{cite web

Education in Nigeria is overseen by the [[Nigerian Federal Ministry of Education|Ministry of Education]]. [[Local Government Areas of Nigeria|Local authorities]] take responsibility for implementing policy for state-controlled [[public education]] and [[state schools]] at a regional level. The education system is divided into [[Kindergarten]], [[primary education]], [[secondary education]] and [[tertiary education]]. After the 1970s oil boom, tertiary education was improved so that it would reach every subregion of Nigeria. 68% of the Nigerian population is literate, and the rate for men (75.7%) is higher than that for women (60.6%).<ref name=CP2006>{{cite web|title=Country Profile – Nigeria|publisher=[[United States Library of Congress]] – Federal Research Division|date=July 2008|url= http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Nigeria.pdf|accessdate =28 May 2011}}</ref>

Nigeria provides free, government-supported education, but attendance is not compulsory at any level, and certain groups, such as nomads and the handicapped, are under-served. The education system consists of six years of primary school, three years of junior secondary school, three years of senior secondary school, and four, five or six years of university education leading to a bachelor's degree.<ref name=CP2006/>

The various Nigerian [[Confraternities in Nigeria|Confraternities]] or "campus cults" are active in both organised crime and in political violence as well as providing a network of corruption within Nigeria. As confraternities have extensive connections with political and military figures, they offer excellent alumni networking opportunities.

Internationally, Nigeria is infamous for a form of bank fraud dubbed ''419'', a type of [[advance fee fraud]] (named after Section 419 of the Nigerian Penal Code) along with the "[[Nigerian scam]]", a form of [[confidence trick]] practised by individuals and criminal syndicates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haverford.edu/pols/faculty/glickman/Articles/CJAS_Text_final_1-35.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050115001333/http://www.haverford.edu/pols/faculty/glickman/Articles/CJAS_Text_final_1-35.pdf|archivedate=15 January 2005|title=The Nigerian "419" Advance Fee Scams: Prank or Peril?|author= Glickman, Harvey |publisher=[[Haverford College]], Department of Political science |year= 2005 |accessdate=27 May 2011}}</ref> These scams involve a complicit Nigerian bank (the laws being set up loosely to allow it) and a scammer who claims to have money he needs to obtain from that bank. The victim is talked into exchanging bank account information on the premise that the money will be transferred to them, and that they will get to keep a cut. In reality, money is taken out instead, and/or large fees (which seem small in comparison with the imaginary wealth he awaits) are deducted. In 2003, the Nigerian [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] (or EFCC) was created, ostensibly to combat this and other forms of organised financial crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efccnigeria.org |title=Economic and Financial Crimes Commission – EFCC – Home |publisher=Efccnigeria.org |accessdate=21 December 2010}}</ref>

[[File:NG-Sharia.png|thumb|left|Nigerian states that implement some form of sharia law (in green)]]
Because of its multitude of diverse, sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria prior to independence was faced with sectarian tensions and violence, particularly in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. Some of the ethnic groups like the [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]], have experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction.

Since the end of the civil war in 1970, some ethnic violence has persisted. There has subsequently been a period of relative harmony{{when|date=August 2016}} since the Federal Government introduced tough new measures against religious violence in all affected parts of the country. The 2002 [[Miss World]] pageant was moved from [[Abuja]] to London in the wake of [[Miss World riots|violent protests by Muslims in the Northern part of the country]] that left more than 100&nbsp;people dead and over 500 injured.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/23/newsid_3226000/3226740.stm |work=BBC News |title='2002:Riots force Miss World out of Nigeria' |date=23 November 2002 |accessdate=24 January 2011}}</ref> The rioting erupted after Muslims in the country reacted in anger to comments made by a newspaper reporter. Muslim rioters in [[Kaduna]] killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital.

Austria played a central role in [[European History]] from the late [[18th century|18th]] to the early [[20th century]]. It initially emerged as a [[Margraviate of Austria|margraviate]] around 976 and developed into a [[Duchy of Austria|duchy]] and later [[Archduchy of Austria|archduchy]]. In the [[16th century]], Austria started serving as the heart of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the junior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] – one of the most influential [[royal house]]s in history. As archduchy, it was a major component and administrative centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Following the Holy Roman Empire's dissolution, Austria founded [[Austrian Empire|its own empire]] in the [[19th century]], which became a [[great power]] and the leading force of the [[German Confederation]]. Subsequent to the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|establishment of a union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was created. Austria was involved in both [[world war]]s; it started the [[World War I|first one]] under Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] and served as the birthplace of [[Adolf Hitler]], who provoked the [[World War II|second one]].

Austria is a [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a [[President of Austria|President]] as head of state and a [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] as head of government. Major [[List of cities and towns in Austria|urban areas of Austria]] include [[Graz]], [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Innsbruck]]. Austria is consistently ranked as one of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|richest countries in the world]] by per capita GDP terms. The country has developed a [[list of countries by Human Development Index|high standard of living]] and in 2018 was ranked 20th in the world for its [[Human Development Index]].

==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Austria}}

[[File:Ostarrichi.jpg|thumb|left|The first appearance of the word "Ostarrîchi", circled in red. Modern Austria honours this document, dated 996, as the founding of the nation.]]

The German name for Austria, {{lang|de|Österreich}}, derives from the [[Old High German]] ''Ostarrîchi'', which meant "eastern realm" and which first appeared in the "Ostarrîchi document" of 996.<ref name="University of Klagenfurt">{{cite web|url=http://wwwg.uni-klu.ac.at/spw/oenf/name2.htm|title=University of Klagenfurt}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| editor1-last = Bischof| editor1-first=Günter| editor-link=Günter Bischof |editor2-last=Pelinka| editor2-first=Anton| editor2-link=Anton Pelinka| title=Austrian Historical Memory and National Identity| publisher=Transaction Publishers| place=New Brunswick| date=1997| isbn=978-1-56000-902-3 |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=tfhADwAAQBAJ&pg=PT34&lpg=PA92#v=onepage|pages=20–21}}</ref> This word is probably a translation of [[Medieval Latin]] {{lang|la|[[Marchia orientalis]]}} into a local (Bavarian) dialect. Another theory says that this name comes from the local name of the mountain whose original Slovenian name is "Ostravica" (sharp mountain) - because it is very steep on both sides.
Austria was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976. The word "Austria" is a Latinisation of the German name and was first recorded in the 12th century.<ref>{{cite book| ref=harv |author-last1 = Brauneder| author-first1 = Wilhelm| title = Österreichische Verfassungsgeschichte| edition = 11th| publisher = Manzsche Verlags- und Universitätsbuchhandlung| place = Vienna| date = 2009| isbn = 978-3-214-14876-8| page=17}}</ref>
At the time, the Danube basin of Austria ([[Upper Austria|Upper]] and [[Lower Austria]]) was the easternmost extent of Bavaria.

==History==
{{Main|History of Austria}}

The Central European land that is now Austria was settled in pre-Roman times by various [[Celt]]ic tribes. The Celtic kingdom of [[Noricum]] was later claimed by the [[Roman Empire]] and made a province. Present-day Petronell-[[Carnuntum]] in eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the Upper Pannonia province. Carnuntum was home for 50,000 people for nearly 400 years.<ref name="Carnuntum Tourism">{{cite web|last =|first =|authorlink =|title =Rome's metropolis on the Danube awakens to new life|website =Archäologischer Park Carnuntum|publisher =Archäologische Kulturpark Niederösterreich Betriebsgesellschaft m.b.H.|date =|url =http://www.carnuntum.co.at/content-en/tales-from-carnuntum|doi =|accessdate =20 February 2010|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100116125751/http://www.carnuntum.co.at/content-en/tales-from-carnuntum|archivedate =16 January 2010|deadurl =yes|df =dmy-all}}</ref>

After the fall of the Roman Empire, the area was invaded by [[Bavarians]], [[Slavs]], and [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]].<ref name="johnson 19" /> [[Charlemagne]], King of the Franks, conquered the area in AD 788, encouraged colonization, and introduced Christianity.<ref name="johnson 19">Johnson 19</ref> As part of [[Eastern Francia]], the core areas that now encompass Austria were bequeathed to the house of [[Babenberg]]. The area was known as the ''[[March of Austria|marchia Orientalis]]'' and was given to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976.<ref name="johnson 20">Johnson 20–21</ref>

[[File:2011-07-09 gasometer 28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]], 28,000 to 25,000 BC. [[Naturhistorisches Museum|Museum of Natural History Vienna]]]]

The first record showing the name Austria is from 996, where it is written as ''[[Ostarrîchi]]'', referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.<ref name="johnson 20" /> In 1156, the [[Privilegium Minus]] elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]]. With the death of [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs was extinguished.<ref name="johnson 21">Johnson 21</ref>

As a result, [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria, and [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]].<ref name="johnson 21" /> His reign came to an end with his defeat at [[Dürnkrut]] at the hands of [[Rudolph I of Germany]] in 1278.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 23</ref> Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the [[Habsburgs]].

=== Middle Ages ===
In the 14th and 15th centuries, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438, Duke [[Albert V of Austria]] was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, [[Emperor Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.

The Habsburgs began also to accumulate territory far from the hereditary lands. In 1477, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Maximilian]], only son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], married the heiress Maria of [[County of Burgundy|Burgundy]], thus acquiring most of the [[Netherlands]] for the family.<ref name="johnson 25">Lonnie Johnson 25</ref><ref name="brook 11">Brook-Shepherd 11</ref> In 1496, his son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] married [[Joanna the Mad]], the heiress of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], thus acquiring Spain and its Italian, African, and [[New World]] appendages for the Habsburgs.<ref name="johnson 25" /><ref name="brook 11" />

In 1526, following the [[Battle of Mohács]], [[Bohemia]] and the part of [[Hungary]] not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 26</ref> [[Ottoman–Hungarian Wars|Ottoman expansion]] into Hungary led to [[Ottoman–Habsburg wars|frequent conflicts]] between the two empires, particularly evident in the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] of 1593 to 1606. The Turks made incursions into [[Styria]] nearly 20 times,<ref>"'' The Catholic encyclopedia''". Charles George Herbermann (1913). Robert Appleton company.</ref> of which some are cited as "burning, pillaging, and taking thousands of slaves".<ref>"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8-ARAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA560#v=onepage Bentley's miscellany]''". Charles Dickens, William Harrison Ainsworth, Albert Smith (1853).</ref> In late September 1529 Suleiman the Magnificent launched the first [[Siege of Vienna]], which unsuccessfully ended, according to Ottoman historians, with the snowfalls of an early beginning winter.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===
[[File:Vienna Battle 1683.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683 broke the advance of the [[Ottoman Empire]] into Europe.]]

During the long reign of [[Emperor Leopold I|Leopold I]] (1657–1705) and following the successful [[Battle of Vienna|defence of Vienna]] against the Turks in 1683 (under the command of the King of Poland, [[John III Sobieski]]),<ref>Lonnie Johnson 26–28</ref> a [[Great Turkish War|series of campaigns]] resulted in bringing most of Hungary to Austrian control by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.

[[Emperor Charles VI]] relinquished many of the gains the empire made in the previous years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg. Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]], the [[German dualism|Austrian–Prussian dualism]] began in Germany. Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three [[Partitions of Poland]] (in 1772 and 1795).

===19th century===
[[File:CongressVienna.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Congress of Vienna]] met in 1814–15. The objective of the Congress was to settle the many issues arising from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]

Austria later became engaged in a war with [[Revolutionary France]], at the beginning highly unsuccessfully, with successive defeats at the hands of Napoleon, meaning the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Two years earlier,<ref>Lonnie Johnson 34</ref> the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] was founded. From 1792 to 1801, the Austrians had suffered 754,700 casualties.<ref>Clodfelter</ref> In 1814, Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

It emerged from the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as one of the continent's four dominant powers and a recognised [[great power]]. The same year, the [[German Confederation]] ({{lang|de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political, and national conflicts, the German lands were shaken by the [[1848 revolution]] aiming to create a unified Germany.<ref name="johnson 36">Johnson 36</ref>

[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|A map showing the [[German Confederation]] (1815-1836) with its 39 member states.]]

The various different possibilities for a united Germany were: a [[Kleindeutschland and Großdeutschland|Greater Germany]], or a [[United States of Greater Austria|Greater Austria]] or just the German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]], the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against [[Denmark]] and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. As they could not agree on how the two duchies should be administered, though, they fought the [[Austro-Prussian War]] in 1866. Defeated by Prussia in the [[Battle of Königgrätz]],<ref name="johnson 36" /> Austria had to leave the German Confederation and subsequently no longer took part in German politics.<ref name="johnson 55">Lonnie Johnson 55</ref><ref>Schulze 233</ref>

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], the ''Ausgleich'', provided for a dual sovereignty, the [[Austrian Empire]] and the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], under [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].<ref>Lonnie Johnson 59</ref> The Austrian-Hungarian rule of this diverse empire included various [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] groups, including Croats, Czechs, Poles, [[Rusyns]], Serbs, Slovaks, Slovenes, and Ukrainians, as well as large Italian and Romanian communities.

As a result, ruling Austria–Hungary became increasingly difficult in an age of emerging nationalist movements, requiring considerable reliance on an expanded secret police. Yet, the government of Austria tried its best to be accommodating in some respects: The ''Reichsgesetzblatt'', publishing the laws and ordinances of [[Cisleithania]], was issued in eight languages; all national groups were entitled to schools in their own language and to the use of their mother tongue at state offices, for example.

[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|An ethno-linguistic map of Austria–Hungary, 1910]]

Many Austrians of all different social circles such as [[Georg Ritter von Schönerer]] promoted strong [[German nationalism in Austria|pan-Germanism]] in hope of reinforcing an ethnic German identity and the annexation of Austria to Germany.<ref name="DPSO">{{cite web | url=http://www.politischebildung.at/upload/polsystem.pdf | title=Das politische System in Österreich (The Political System in Austria) | publisher=Austrian Federal Press Service | date=2000 | accessdate=9 July 2014 | page=24 | language=German | location=Vienna}}</ref> Some Austrians such as [[Karl Lueger]] also used pan-Germanism as a form of populism to further their own political goals. Although Bismarck's policies excluded Austria and the German Austrians from Germany, many Austrian pan-Germans idolized him and wore blue cornflowers, known to be the favourite flower of German Emperor [[William I, German Emperor|William I]], in their buttonholes, along with cockades in the German national colours (black, red, and yellow), although they were both temporarily banned in Austrian schools, as a way to show discontent towards the multi-ethnic empire.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Daniel L. |last=Unowsky |title=The Pomp and Politics of Patriotism: Imperial Celebrations in Habsburg Austria, 1848–1916 |publisher=Purdue University Press |year=2005 |page=157}}</ref>

Austria's exclusion from Germany caused many Austrians a problem with their national identity and prompted the Social Democratic Leader [[Otto Bauer]] to state that it was "the conflict between our Austrian and German character."<ref>Evan Burr Bukey, Hitler's Austria: Popular Sentiment in the Nazi Era, 1938-1945, p. 6</ref> The Austro-Hungarian Empire caused ethnic tension between the German Austrians and the other ethnic groups. Many Austrians, especially those involved with the pan-German movements, desired for the reinforcement of an ethnic German identity and hoped that the empire would collapse which would subsequently allow an [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria with Germany]].<ref>Brigitte Hamann, Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man, p. 394</ref>

A lot of Austrian pan-German nationalists protested passionately against minister-president [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni|Kasimir Count Badeni]]'s language decree of 1897, which made German and Czech co-official languages in Bohemia and required new government officials to be fluent in both languages. This meant in practice that the civil service would almost exclusively hire Czechs, because most middle-class Czechs spoke the German language, but not the other way around. The support of [[ultramontanism|ultramontane]] Catholic politicians and clergy for this reform triggered the launch of the "[[Away from Rome]]" ({{lang-de|Los-von-Rom}}) movement, which was initiated by supporters of Schönerer and called on "German" Christians to leave the Roman Catholic Church.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suppan |title='Germans' in the Habsburg Empire | work=The Germans and the East | year=2008 | pages=164, 172}}</ref>

[[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] in [[Sarajevo]] in 1914 by Bosnian Serb [[Gavrilo Princip]]<ref>Johnson 52–54</ref> was used by leading Austrian politicians and generals to persuade the emperor to declare war on Serbia, thereby risking and prompting the outbreak of World War I, but it was not the only cause of the war. which eventually led to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Over one million Austro-Hungarian soldiers died in World War I.<ref>Grebler, Leo and Winkler, Wilhelm ''The Cost of the World War to Germany and Austria-Hungary'', Yale University Press, 1940.</ref>

On 21 October 1918, the elected German members of the ''Reichsrat'' (parliament of Imperial Austria) met in Vienna as the Provisional National Assembly for German Austria (''Provisorische Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich''). On 30 October the assembly founded the [[Republic of German Austria]] by appointing a government, called ''Staatsrat''. This new government was invited by the Emperor to take part in the decision on the planned armistice with Italy, but refrained from this business.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

This left the responsibility for the end of the war, on 3 November 1918, solely to the emperor and his government. On 11 November, the emperor, advised by ministers of the old and the new governments, declared he would not take part in state business any more; on 12 November, German Austria, by law, declared itself to be a democratic republic and part of the new German republic. The constitution, renaming the ''Staatsrat'' as ''Bundesregierung'' (federal government) and ''Nationalversammlung'' as ''Nationalrat'' (national council) was passed on 10 November 1920.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] of 1919 (for Hungary the [[Treaty of Trianon]] of 1920) confirmed and consolidated the new order of Central Europe which to a great extent had been established in November 1918, creating new states and altering others. The German-speaking parts of Austria which had been part of Austria-Hungary were reduced to a rump state named The [[Republic of German-Austria]] (German: ''Republik Deutschösterreich'').<ref>In Habsburg Austria-Hungary, "German-Austria" was an unofficial term for the areas of the empire inhabited by Austrian Germans.</ref><ref>Alfred D.

Over 3 million German-speaking Austrians found themselves living outside the new Austrian Republic as minorities in the newly formed or enlarged states of [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Hungary]], and Italy.<ref>Brook-Shepherd 246</ref> These included the provinces of [[South Tyrol]] (which became part of Italy) and [[German Bohemia]] (Czechoslovakia). The status of German Bohemia (Sudetenland) later played a role in sparking the Second World War.<ref name="a1">Brook-Shepherd 245</ref>

The status of South Tyrol was a lingering problem between Austria and Italy until it was officially settled by the 1980s with a great degree of autonomy being granted to it by the Italian national government. Between 1918 and 1919, Austria was known as the State of [[German Austria]] ({{lang|de|Staat Deutschösterreich}}). Not only did the [[Allies of World War I|Entente powers]] forbid German Austria to unite with Germany, but they also rejected the name German Austria in the peace treaty to be signed; it was, therefore, changed to Republic of Austria in late 1919.<ref name="a1" />

The border between Austria and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes]] (later Yugoslavia) was settled with the [[Carinthian Plebiscite]] in October 1920 and allocated the major part of the territory of the former Austro-Hungarian Crownland of Carinthia to Austria. This set the border on the [[Karavanke|Karawanken]] mountain range, with many Slovenes remaining in Austria.

After the war, inflation began to devalue the Krone, which was still Austria's currency. In autumn 1922, Austria was granted an international loan supervised by the [[League of Nations]].<ref>Brook-Shepherd 257–8</ref> The purpose of the loan was to avert bankruptcy, stabilise the currency, and improve Austria's general economic condition. The loan meant that Austria passed from an independent state to the control exercised by the League of Nations. In 1925, the ''[[Austrian schilling|Schilling]]'' was introduced, replacing the Krone at a rate of 10,000:1. Later, it was nicknamed the "Alpine dollar" due to its stability. From 1925 to 1929, the economy enjoyed a short high before nearly crashing{{clarify|date=December 2016}} after [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Black Tuesday]].

The [[First Austrian Republic]] lasted until 1933, when Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], using what he called [[Selbstausschaltung des Parlaments|"self-switch-off of Parliament"]], established an autocratic regime tending towards [[Italian fascism]].<ref name="johnson 104">Lonnie Johnson 104</ref><ref name="brook 269">Brook-Shepherd 269–70</ref> The two big parties at this time, the Social Democrats and the Conservatives, had paramilitary armies;<ref name="Brook-Shepherd 261">Brook-Shepherd 261</ref> the Social Democrats' ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund|Schutzbund]]'' was now declared illegal, but was still operative<ref name="Brook-Shepherd 261" /> as [[Austrian Civil War|civil war]] broke out.<ref name="johnson 104" /><ref name="brook 269" /><ref name="johnson 107">Johnson 107</ref>

He established a plebiscite confirming the union with Germany in April 1938.

Parliamentary elections were held in Germany (including recently annexed Austria) on 10 April 1938. They were the final elections to the Reichstag during Nazi rule, and took the form of a single-question referendum asking whether voters approved of a single Nazi-party list for the 813-member Reichstag, as well as the recent annexation of Austria (the Anschluss).

On 12 March 1938, Austria was annexed to the [[Third Reich]] and ceased to exist as an independent country. The [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanisation]] of the wealth of Jewish Austrians started immediately in mid-March, with a so-called "wild" (i.e. extra-legal) phase, but was soon structured legally and bureaucratically to strip Jewish citizens of any assets they possessed.

The invading Allied powers, in particular the Americans, planned for the supposed "Alpine Fortress Operation" of a national redoubt, that was largely to have taken place on Austrian soil in the mountains of the eastern Alps. However, it never materialised because of the rapid collapse of the Reich.

[[Karl Renner]] and [[Adolf Schärf]] (Socialist Party of Austria [Social Democrats and Revolutionary Socialists]), Leopold Kunschak (Austria's People's Party [former Christian Social People's Party]), and Johann Koplenig (Communist Party of Austria) declared Austria's secession from the Third Reich by the Declaration of Independence on 27 April 1945 and set up a [[provisional government]] in Vienna under state Chancellor Renner the same day, with the approval of the victorious [[Red Army]] and backed by [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name="johnson 135">Lonnie Johnson 135–6</ref> (The date is officially named the birthday of the second republic.) At the end of April, most of western and southern Austria were still under Nazi rule. On 1 May 1945, the federal constitution of 1929, which had been terminated by dictator Dollfuss on 1 May 1934, was declared valid again.

Total [[World War II casualties#endnote Austria|military deaths]] from 1939 to 1945 are estimated at 260,000.<ref>Rüdiger Overmans. ''Deutsche militärische Verluste im Zweiten Weltkrieg.''

Much like Germany, Austria was [[Allied-occupied Austria|divided]] into American, British, French, and Soviet zones and governed by the [[Allied Commission for Austria]].<ref>Lonnie Johnson 137</ref> As forecast in the [[Moscow Declaration]] in 1943, a subtle difference was seen in the treatment of Austria by the Allies.<ref name="johnson 135" /> The Austrian government, consisting of Social Democrats, Conservatives, and Communists (until 1947), and residing in Vienna, which was surrounded by the Soviet zone, was recognised by the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] in October 1945 after some doubts that Renner could be Stalin's puppet. Thus, the creation of a separate Western Austrian government and the division of the country was avoidable. Austria, in general, was treated as though it had been originally invaded by Germany and liberated by the Allies.<ref>Manfried Rauchensteiner: Der Sonderfall.

On 15 May 1955, after talks which lasted for years and were influenced by the [[Cold War]], Austria regained full independence by concluding the [[Austrian State Treaty]] with the Four Occupying Powers. On 26 October 1955, after all occupation troops had left, Austria declared its "permanent neutrality" by an act of parliament.<ref name="johnson 153">Lonnie Johnson 153</ref> This day is now Austria's [[National Day]], a public holiday.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.austria.org/national-day/ |title=The Austrian National Day |website=Austrian Embassy, Washington |language=en-US |access-date=2018-10-24 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|Austria joined the European Union in 1995 and signed the [[Lisbon Treaty]] in 2007.]]

The political system of the [[Second Austrian Republic|Second Republic]] is based on the constitution of 1920 and 1929, which was reintroduced in 1945. The system came to be characterised by ''[[Proporz]]'', meaning that most posts of political importance were split evenly between members of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ) and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP).<ref>Lonnie Johnson 139</ref> Interest group "chambers" with mandatory membership (e.g. for workers, business people, farmers) grew to considerable importance and were usually consulted in the legislative process, so hardly any legislation was passed that did not reflect widespread consensus.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 165</ref>

Since 1945, governing via a single-party government has occurred twice: 1966–1970 (ÖVP) and 1970–1983 (SPÖ). During all other legislative periods, either a [[grand coalition]] of SPÖ and ÖVP or a "small coalition" (one of these two and a smaller party) ruled the country.

[[Kurt Waldheim]], a Wehrmacht officer in the Second World War [[Austria — the Nazis' first victim#Waldheim Affair|accused of war crimes]], was elected President of Austria from 1986 to 1992.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kurt Waldheim {{!}} president of Austria and secretary-general of the United Nations |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kurt-Waldheim |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=25 September 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

Following a [[Austrian European Union membership referendum, 1994|referendum in 1994]], at which consent reached a majority of two-thirds, the country became a member of the [[European Union]] on 1 January 1995.<ref>Brook-Shepherd 447,449</ref>

The major parties SPÖ and ÖVP have contrary opinions about the future status of Austria's military nonalignment: While the SPÖ in public supports a neutral role, the ÖVP argues for stronger integration into the EU's security policy; even a future NATO membership is not ruled out by some ÖVP politicians (ex. Dr Werner Fasslabend (OVP) in 1997). In reality, Austria is taking part in the EU's [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]], participates in [[peacekeeping]] and peace creating tasks, and has become a member of [[NATO]]'s "Partnership for Peace"; the constitution has been amended accordingly. Since [[Liechtenstein]] joined the [[Schengen Area]] in 2011, none of Austria's neighbouring countries performs border controls towards it anymore.

[[File:Wien - Hofburg, Leopoldinischer Trakt.JPG|thumb|The Leopoldine Wing of [[Hofburg Imperial Palace]] in [[Vienna]], home to the offices of the [[Austrian president]].]]
The [[Parliament of Austria]] is located in [[Vienna]], the country's largest city and capital. Austria became a [[Federation|federal]], [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] through the [[Federal Constitution (Austria)|Federal Constitution]] of 1920. The political system of the Second Republic with its [[States of Austria|nine states]] is based on the constitution of 1920, amended in 1929, which was reenacted on 1 May 1945.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 17, 142</ref>

The [[head of state]] is the [[President of Austria|Federal President]] (''Bundespräsident''), who is directly elected by popular vote. The chairman of the [[Government of Austria|Federal Government]] is the [[Chancellor of Austria|Federal Chancellor]], who is appointed by the President. The government can be removed from office by either a presidential decree or by [[vote of no confidence]] in the lower chamber of parliament, the [[National Council of Austria|Nationalrat]]. Voting for the Federal President and for the Parliament used to be compulsory in Austria, but this was abolished in steps from 1982 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103221527/http://www.bmi.gv.at/wahlen/elections_compulsorey_voting.asp|archivedate=3 November 2007|title=Bundesministerium für Inneres – Elections Compulsory voting|publisher=Bmi.gv.at|accessdate=3 January 2009}}</ref>

The Parliament of Austria consists of two chambers. The composition of the Nationalrat (183 seats) is determined every five years (or whenever the Nationalrat has been dissolved by the federal president on a motion by the federal chancellor, or by Nationalrat itself) by a general election in which every citizen over 16 years (since 2007) has [[Suffrage|voting rights]]. While there is a general threshold of 4% for all parties at federal elections (Nationalratswahlen), there remains the possibility to gain a direct seat, or {{lang|de|Direktmandat}}, in one of the 43 regional election districts.

The Nationalrat is the dominant chamber in the formation of legislation in Austria. However, the upper house of parliament, the [[Federal Council of Austria|Bundesrat]], has a limited right of veto (the Nationalrat can—in almost all cases—ultimately pass the respective bill by voting a second time. This is referred to as '''Beharrungsbeschluss'', lit. "vote of persistence"). A convention, called the {{lang|de|Österreich -Konvent}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.konvent.gv.at/ |title=Willkommen beim Österreich Konvent |publisher=Konvent.gv.at |accessdate=21 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090104001526/http://www.konvent.gv.at/| archivedate= 4 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> was convened on 30 June 2003 to decide upon suggestions to reform the constitution, but failed to produce a proposal that would receive the two-thirds of votes in the Nationalrat necessary for constitutional amendments and/or reform.

With legislative and executive, the courts are the third column of Austrian state powers. Notably the Constitutional Court (''Verfassungsgerichtshof'') may exert considerable influence on the political system by ruling out laws and ordinances not in compliance with the constitution. Since 1995, the [[European Court of Justice]] may overrule Austrian decisions in all matters defined in laws of the European Union. Austria also implements the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], since the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] is part of the Austrian constitution.

===Since 2006===
[[File:Wien - Bundeskanzleramt1.JPG|thumb|Federal Chancellery on Ballhausplatz.]]
After general elections held in October 2006, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SPÖ) emerged as the strongest party, and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) came in second, having lost about 8% of its previous polling.<ref name="Election2002">{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2002|title=24 November 2002 General Election Results – Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref><ref name="Election2006">{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2006|title=October&nbsp;1st,&nbsp;2006 General Election Results – Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref> Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and SPÖ formed a grand coalition with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008.

Elections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (SPÖ and ÖVP) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party. They formed a coalition with [[Werner Faymann]] from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The Green Party came in third with 11% of the vote. The FPÖ and the deceased [[Jörg Haider]]'s new party [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]], both on the political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote.

In the [[Austrian legislative election, 2013|legislative elections of 2013]], the Social Democratic Party received 27% of the vote and 52 seats; People's Party 24% and 47 seats, thus controlling together the majority of the seats. The Freedom Party received 40 seats and 21% of the votes, while the Greens received 12% and 24 seats. Two new parties, Stronach and the NEOS, received less than 10% of the vote, and 11 and nine seats respectively.

After the Grand Coalition broke in Spring 2017 a snap election was proclaimed for [[Austrian legislative election, 2017|October 2017]]. The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) with its new young leader Sebastian Kurz emerged as the largest party in the National Council, winning 31.5% of votes and 62 of the 183 seats. The Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) finished second with 52 seats and 26.9% votes, slightly ahead of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), which received 51 seats and 26%. NEOS finished fourth with 10 seats (5.3 percent of votes), and PILZ (which split from the Green Party at the start of the campaign) entered parliament for the first time and came in fifth place with 8 seats and 4.4% The Green Party failed with 3.8% to cross the 4% threshold and was ejected from parliament, losing all of its 24 seats. The ÖVP has decided to form a coalation with the FPÖ, the new government between the center-right wing and the right-wing populist party under the new chancellor Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on 18 December 2017.

[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement européen Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[European Parliament]]: Austria is one of the 28 EU members.]]

The 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional article in which "Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality". The second section of this law stated that "in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.

Austria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Austria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE). As an OSCE-participating State, Austria's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]].

===Military===
{{Main|Austrian Armed Forces}}

The manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesheer}}) mainly relies on [[conscription]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months compulsory [[military service]], followed by an eight-year reserve obligation. Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service.<ref name="CIA" /> [[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection]] is legally acceptable and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalised nine months [[Zivildienst in Austria|civilian service]] instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.

The main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkräfteführungskommando, SKFüKdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkräfte), Air Forces (Luftstreitkräfte), International Missions (Internationale Einsätze) and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkräfte), next to Joint Mission Support Command (Kommando Einsatzunterstützung; KdoEU) and Joint Command Support Centre (Führungsunterstützungszentrum; FüUZ). Austria is a [[landlocked country]] and has no navy.

In 2012, Austria's defence expenditures corresponded to approximately 0.8% of its GDP. The Army currently has about 26,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/defence-data-portal/Austria/year/2012|title=Defence Data|website=europa.eu}}</ref> soldiers, of whom about 12,000 are conscripts. As head of state, [[President of Austria|Austrian President]] is nominally the Commander-in-Chief of the Bundesheer. Command of the Austrian Armed Forces is exercised by the Minister of Defence, {{as of|2018|March|lc=yes}}: [[Mario Kunasek]].

Since the end of the [[Cold War]], and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded "[[Iron Curtain]]" separating Austria and its [[Eastern Bloc]] neighbours ([[Hungary]] and former [[Czechoslovakia]]), the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]]. This assistance came to an end when Hungary and [[Slovakia]] joined the EU [[Schengen Area]] in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing "internal" border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of [[natural disaster]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria 1920 (reinst. 1945, rev. 2013)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.

Within its [[Declaration of Neutrality|self-declared status of permanent neutrality]], Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]].

===Administrative divisions=== <!---"Administrative divisions of Austria" redirects here--->
{{main|States of Austria}}
As a [[federal republic]], Austria is divided into [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesländer}}).<ref name="CIA" /> These states are then divided into [[Districts of Austria|districts]] ({{lang|de|[[Bezirke]]}}) and statutory cities ({{lang|de|[[Statutarstadt|Statutarstädte]]}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|Gemeinden}}). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social care, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been discussed whether today it is appropriate for a small country to maintain ten parliaments.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Austria}}

Austria is a largely mountainous country due to its location in the [[Alps]].<ref name="BritannicaAlps">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/17356/Alps|title=Alps|date=11 June 2009|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|accessdate=12 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090601083317/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/17356/Alps| archivedate= 1 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> The [[Central Eastern Alps]], [[Northern Limestone Alps]] and [[Southern Limestone Alps]] are all partly in Austria. Of the total area of Austria ({{convert|84000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below {{convert|500|m|ft|0}}. The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.

Austria lies between latitudes [[46th parallel north|46°]] and [[49th parallel north|49° N]], and longitudes [[9th meridian east|9°]] and [[18th meridian east|18° E]].

It can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the [[Eastern Alps]], which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] comprises the remaining 4%.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Austria belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Austria can be subdivided into four ecoregions: the Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, Alps conifer and mixed forests and Western European broadleaf forests.

The greater part of Austria lies in the cool/temperate [[climate zone]], where humid westerly winds predominate. With nearly three-quarters of the country dominated by the Alps, the [[alpine climate]] is predominant. In the east—in the [[Pannonian Plain]] and along the [[Danube|Danube valley]]—the climate shows continental features with less rain than the alpine areas. Although Austria is cold in the winter (−10 to 0&nbsp;°C), summer temperatures can be relatively high,<ref name="Climate">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003350|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202042009/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT003350|archivedate=2 December 2010|title=Average Conditions, Vienna, Austria|year=2006|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=24 May 2009}}</ref> with average temperatures in the mid-20s and a highest temperature of {{convert|40.5|°C|0}} in August 2013.<ref name=ZAMG>{{cite web|url= http://www.zamg.ac.at/cms/de/klima/klimauebersichten/klimamittel-1971-2000|title= Austrian Meteorological Institute}}</ref>

According to the [[Köppen Classification|Köppen Climate Classification]] Austria has the following climate types: [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic (Cfb)]], [[Humid continental climate|Cool/Warm-summer humid continental (Dfb)]], [[Subarctic climate|Subarctic/Subalpine (Dfc)]], [[Tundra climate|Tundra/Alpine (ET)]] and [[Ice cap climate|Ice-Cap (EF)]]. It is important to note though that Austria may experience very cold, severe winters, but most of the time they are only around as cold as those in somewhat comparable climate zones, for example Southern Scandinavia or Eastern Europe. As well, at higher altitudes, summers are usually considerably cooler than in the valleys/lower altitudes. The subarctic and tundra climates seen around the Alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere due in part to the Oceanic influence on this part of Europe.<ref name="ZAMG"/><ref>{{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/country/4/|title= Climate-Data.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title= Atlantic influence on the Alps|journal= Environmental Research Letters|volume= 8|issue= 3|pages= 034026|doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034026|year= 2013|last1= Zampieri|first1= Matteo|last2= Scoccimarro|first2= Enrico|last3= Gualdi|first3= Silvio}}</ref>

[[File:13-08-30-wien-by-RalfR-123.jpg|thumb|Modern [[Vienna]], [[Vienna International Centre]] with the [[United Nations Office at Vienna]] and the [[DC Towers|DC Tower 1]].]]

Austria consistently ranks high in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]],<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&ey=2012&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=122&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=37&pr.y=14 |title=Austria|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> due to its highly industrialized economy, and well-developed [[social market economy]]. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, [[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies. [[Labour movement]]s are particularly influential, exercising large influence on labour politics and decisions related to the expansion of the economy. Next to a highly developed industry, international tourism is the most important part of the [[economy of Austria]].

Germany has historically been the main trading partner of Austria, making it vulnerable to rapid changes in the [[German economy]]. Since Austria became a member state of the [[European Union]], it has gained closer ties to other EU economies, reducing its economic dependence on Germany. In addition, membership of the EU has drawn an influx of foreign investors attracted by Austria's access to the single European market and proximity to the aspiring economies of the European Union. Growth in GDP reached 3.3% in 2006.<ref>[http://www.oenb.at/isaweb/report.do?&lang=EN&report=7.7 Real GDP Growth – Expenditure Side], provided by the [[Oesterreichische Nationalbank|Austrian National Bank]] {{de icon}}</ref> At least 67% of Austria's imports come from other European Union member states.<ref>{{cite web|title=OEC – Austria (AUT) Exports, Imports, and Trade Partners|url=http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/aut/|website=atlas.media.mit.edu|accessdate=12 March 2016}}</ref>

Austria indicated on 16 November 2010 that it would withhold the December installment of its contribution to the EU bailout of Greece, citing the material worsening of the Greek debt situation and the apparent inability of Greece to collect the level of tax receipts it had previously promised.<ref>{{cite web |author=Mark |url=http://www.marksmarketanalysis.com/2010/11/austria-withholds-greek-bailout-funds.html |title=Mark's Market Analysis |publisher=Marksmarketanalysis.com |date=16 November 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110714035955/http://www.marksmarketanalysis.com/2010/11/austria-withholds-greek-bailout-funds.html |archivedate=14 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008]] dented the economy of Austria in other ways as well. It caused, for example, the [[Hypo Alpe-Adria-Bank International]] to be purchased in December 2009 by the government for 1 euro owing to credit difficulties, thus wiping out the €1.63bn of [[BayernLB]]. {{as of|2014|February}}, the HGAA situation was unresolved,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-15/hypo-alpe-s-state-backed-bonds-cut-4-levels-on-insolvency-debate.html|title=Hypo Alpe Debt Cut Four Steps as Insolvency Not Ruled Out|first=Boris|last=Groendahl|work=Bloomberg.com|date=15 February 2014}}</ref> causing Chancellor [[Werner Faymann]] to warn that its failure would be comparable to the 1931 [[Creditanstalt]] event.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-17/austria-s-faymann-channels-1931-creditanstalt-crash-on-hypo-alpe.html|title=Faymann Evokes 1931 Austria Creditanstalt Crash on Hypo Alpe|first=Boris|last=Groendahl|work=Bloomberg.com|date=17 February 2014}}</ref>

Austria's population was estimated to be nearly 9 million (8.83) in 2018 by the [[Statistik Austria]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/web_de/presse/075280|title=STATISTIK AUSTRIA – Presse|author=Statistik Austria|website=statistik.at}}</ref> The population of the capital, [[Vienna]], exceeds 1.8 million<ref name="Vienna pop">{{cite web |url=http://www.statistik.at/blickgem/pz1/g90001.pdf |title=Probezählung 2006 – Bevölkerungszahl |date=31 October 2006 |website=Statistik Austria |format=PDF |language=German |accessdate=27 May 2009 }}</ref> (2.6&nbsp;million, including the suburbs), representing about a quarter of the country's population. It is known for its cultural offerings and high standard of living.

Vienna is by far the country's largest city. [[Graz]] is second in size, with 265,778 inhabitants, followed by [[Linz]] (191,501), [[Salzburg]] (145,871), and [[Innsbruck]] (122,458). All other cities have fewer than 100,000 inhabitants.

According to [[Eurostat]], in 2010 there were 1.27 million foreign-born residents in Austria, corresponding to 15.2% of the total population. Of these, 764,000 (9.1%) were born outside the EU and 512,000 (6.1%) were born in another EU Member State.<ref>[http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_OFFPUB/KS-SF-11-034/EN/KS-SF-11-034-EN.PDF 6.5% of the EU population are foreigners and 9.4% are born abroad], Eurostat, Katya VASILEVA, 34/2011.</ref>

13,000 Turks were naturalised in 2003 and an unknown number have arrived in Austria at the same time. While 2,000 Turks left Austria in the same year, 10,000 immigrated to the country, confirming a strong trend of growth.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2593717.stm |title=Europe &#124; Back to school for Austria immigrants |publisher=BBC News |date=24 December 2002 |accessdate=25 March 2013 |first=Bethany |last=Bell}}</ref> Together, [[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Bosniaks]] and [[Slovenes]] make up about 5.1% of Austria's total population.

===Language===
{{Main|Languages of Austria}}
[[Standard German|Standard]] [[Austrian German]] is Austria's official language, though used primarily just in education, publications, announcements and websites. It is mostly identical to the Standard German of Germany but with some vocabulary differences. This Standard German language is used in formal contexts across Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, as well as among those with significant German-speaking minorities: Italy, Belgium and Denmark. However, the common spoken language of Austria is not the Standard German taught in schools but [[Austro-Bavarian]]: a group of [[Upper German]] local dialects with varying degrees of difficulty being understood by each other as well as by speakers of non-Austrian German dialects. Taken as a collective whole, [[German dialects|German languages or dialects]] are thus spoken natively by 88.6% of the population, which includes the 2.5% German-born citizens who reside in Austria, followed by Turkish (2.28%), Serbian (2.21%), Croatian (1.63%), English (0.73%), Hungarian (0.51%), Bosnian (0.43%), Polish (0.35%), Albanian (0.35%), Slovenian (0.31%), Czech (0.22%), Arabic (0.22%), and Romanian (0.21%).<ref name="Language" />

[[File:Continental West Germanic languages.png|thumb|The national and regional standard varieties of the German language]]

The Austrian federal states of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] and [[Styria]] are home to a significant indigenous [[Carinthian Slovenes|Slovene-speaking minority]] while in the easternmost state, [[Burgenland]] (formerly part of the Hungarian portion of [[Austria–Hungary]]), there are significant [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]- and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]-speaking minorities. Of the remaining number of Austria's people that are of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former [[Eastern Bloc|East Bloc]] nations. [[foreign worker|Guest workers]] ''(Gastarbeiter)'' and their descendants, as well as refugees from the [[Yugoslav wars]] and other conflicts, also form an important [[minority group]] in Austria. Since 1994 the [[Romani people|Roma]]–[[Sinti]] (gypsies) have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.

According to census information published by [[Statistik Austria]] for 2001<ref name="Language" /> there were a total of 710,926 foreign nationals living in Austria. Of these, the largest by far are 283,334 foreign nationals from the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]] (of whom 135,336 speak Serbian; 105,487 Croatian; 31,591 Bosnian – i.e. 272,414 Austrian resident native speakers in total, plus 6,902 Slovenian and 4,018 [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] speakers).

The second largest population of linguistic and ethnic groups are the [[Turkish people|Turks]] (including minority of [[Kurds]]) with a number of 200,000 to 300,000 who currently live in Austria. The Turks and the Kurds are the largest single immigrant group in Austria,<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,488edfe22,49749d5cc,0.html "World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Austria: Turks"].

The next largest population of linguistic and ethnic groups are the 124,392 who speak German as their [[First language|mother tongue]] even though they hail from outside of Austria (mainly immigrants from Germany, some from Switzerland, [[South Tyrol]] in Italy, [[Germans in Romania|Romania]], or the [[Germans in Russia|former Soviet Union]]); 123,417 English; 24,446 Albanian; 17,899 Polish; 14,699 Hungarian; 12,216 Romanian; 10,000 Malayali; 7,982 Arabic; 6,891 Slovak; 6,707 Czech; 5,916 Persian; 5,677 Italian; 5,466 Russian; 5,213 French; 4,938 Chinese; 4,264 Spanish; 3,503 Bulgarian. The numbers for other languages fall off sharply below 3,000.

In 2006, some of the Austrian states introduced standardised tests for new citizens, to assure their language ability, cultural knowledge and accordingly their ability to integrate into the Austrian society.<ref>[http://wien.at/verwaltung/personenwesen/staatsbuergerschaft/allgem.html Requirements to become an Austrian citizen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102627/http://wien.at/verwaltung/personenwesen/staatsbuergerschaft/allgem.html |date=29 September 2007 }}, provided by the Viennese state government {{de icon}}</ref> For the national rules, see [[Austrian nationality law#Naturalization as an Austrian citizen|Austrian nationality law – Naturalisation]].

In 1871, Germany was [[Unification of Germany|founded as a nation-state]], Austria [[German question|was not a part of it]]. After World War I and the breakup of the Austrian monarchy, politicians of the new republic declared its name to be "Deutschösterreich" ([[Republic of German-Austria]]) and that it was part of the [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]]. A unification of the two countries was forbidden by the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] as one of the conditions imposed by the victorious [[Allies of World War I]] upon the vanquished nation, to prevent the creation of a territorially extensive German state.

Following [[World War II]] the number of Serbs expanded again, and today the community is very large. The Austrian Serbian Society was founded in 1936. Today, Serbs in Austria are mainly found in [[Vienna]], [[Salzburg]], and [[Graz]].

An estimated 13,000 to 40,000 [[Slovenes]] in the Austrian state of [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] (the [[Carinthian Slovenes]]) as well as [[Croats]] (around 30,000)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.croates.at/haupt/gesch_fr.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706090820/http://www.croates.at/haupt/gesch_fr.htm |archivedate=6 July 2011 |title=HKDC Geschichte – Frame |publisher=Croates.at |accessdate=21 November 2008}}</ref> and [[Hungarians]] in Burgenland were recognised as a minority and have had special rights following the Austrian State Treaty ({{lang|de|Staatsvertrag}}) of 1955.<ref name="johnson 153" /> The Slovenes in the Austrian state of [[Styria]] (estimated at a number between 1,600 and 5,000) are not recognised as a minority and do not have special rights, although some believe the State Treaty of 27 July 1955 states otherwise.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

The right for bilingual topographic signs for the regions where Slovene and Croat Austrians live alongside the German-speaking population (as required by the 1955 State Treaty) is still to be fully implemented in the view of some, while others believe that the treaty-derived obligations have been met (see below). Many Carinthians are afraid of [[Slovenia]]n territorial claims,{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} pointing to the fact that Yugoslav troops entered the state after each of the two [[World war|World Wars]] and considering that some official Slovenian atlases show parts of Carinthia as Slovene cultural territory. The recently deceased governor, [[Jörg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the Kärntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.

Another interesting phenomenon is the so-called "[[:de:Windischen-Theorie|Windischen-Theorie]]" stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This politically influenced theory, dividing Slovene Austrians into the "loyal Windische" and the "national Slovenes", was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Austria}}

[[File:Melk Stift Altstadt.jpg|thumb|[[Stiftsgymnasium Melk]] is the oldest Austrian school]]
Education in Austria is entrusted partly to the [[States of Austria|Austrian states]] (Bundesländer) and partly to the federal government. School attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.

[[Pre-school]] education (called ''Kindergarten'' in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.

Primary education, or [[Volksschule]], lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The [[The three Rs|3Rs]] (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no [[Streaming (education)|streaming]].

Standard attendance times are 8&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;pm or 1&nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.

As in Germany, secondary education consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the [[Matura]] examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education ([[Höhere Technische Lehranstalt]] HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the [[Matura]]. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as [[Gesamtschule#Germany|Gesamtschulen]]. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.

[[File:Wien - Universität (3).JPG|thumb|The [[University of Vienna]]]]
[[File:Wien 02 Campus WU a.jpg|thumb| The campus of the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]]]
As at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report ("Zeugnis") are a prerequisite for moving up ("aufsteigen") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year ("sitzenbleiben").

It is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as "Gymnasium" (slightly more emphasis on arts) or "Realgymnasium" (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.

The Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee ("''Studienbeitrag''") of €363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. There are some non-state exceptions to this, where students can still study for a subsidized education, for example within the campus system of the [[English Teacher Training College]]. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance).<ref name="Tuition">{{cite web|url=http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|title=Studying in Austria: Tuition Fee|date=1 January 2009|website=Help.gv.at|accessdate=18 June 2009}}</ref> When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around €363.36 per term is charged. Some further exceptions to the fee apply, e.g. for students with a year's salary of more than about €5000. In all cases, an obligatory fee of €17 is charged for the student union and insurance.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Austria}}
[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756–1791)]]

Austria's past as a European power and its cultural environment generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria was the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]] and [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]]. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was born in [[Salzburg]], then an independent Church Principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.

Vienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the [[Baroque period]], Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.

[[File:StateOperaViennaNightBackside.jpg|thumb|left|World-famous [[Vienna State Opera]]]]

Vienna's status began its rise as a cultural centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments, including the [[lute]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the traditional Austrian anthem by Joseph Haydn.

Austrian [[Herbert von Karajan]] was principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] for 35 years. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and he was a dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death.<ref name="NYT obit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|title=Herbert von Karajan Is Dead; Musical Perfectionist was 81|pages=A1|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Rockwell|date=17 July 1989}}</ref>

International pop super star Johann Hölzel, also known by his stage name [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was born in [[Vienna]], Austria 19 February 1957.

[[Conchita Wurst]] is also a renowned singer from the Austrian stock.

Contemporary artist Herbert Brandl.

===Cinema and theatre===
[[File:Michael Haneke 2009.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Michael Haneke]].]]
[[Sascha Kolowrat]] was an Austrian pioneer of filmmaking. [[Billy Wilder]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Josef von Sternberg]], and [[Fred Zinnemann]] originally came from Austria before establishing themselves as internationally relevant movie makers. [[Willi Forst]], [[Ernst Marischka]], or [[Franz Antel]] enriched the popular cinema in German language speaking countries. [[Michael Haneke]] became internationally known for his disturbing cinematic studies, before receiving a [[Golden Globe]] for his critically acclaimed film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' in 2010.

The first Austrian film director to receive an [[Academy Award]] was [[Stefan Ruzowitzky]]. A number of Austrian actors were able to pursue a career, the impact of which was sensed beyond national borders. Among them were [[Peter Lorre]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Curd Jürgens]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Oskar Werner]], and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]. [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] became American as well as international movie stars. The latter also became the 38th Governor of California. [[Christoph Waltz]] rose to international fame with his performance in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', earning the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]] at [[Cannes]] in 2009, and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 2010 and finally two Oscars. [[Max Reinhardt]] was a master of spectacular and astute theatre productions. [[Otto Schenk]] not only excelled as a stage actor, but also as an opera director.

===Science and philosophy===
{{Further|Austrian School|Vienna circle|List of Austrian scientists}}
[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Karl Popper]].]]
Austria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputation. Among them are [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Victor Franz Hess]] and [[Christian Doppler]], prominent scientists in the 19th century. In the 20th century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schrödinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and [[quantum mechanics]] were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day [[quantum physics|quantum physicist]] is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].

In addition to [[physics|physicists]], Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them, biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt Gödel]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.

A focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in [[Medieval Times|medieval times]] with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th-century Vienna School of Medicine. Austria was home to [[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Alfred Adler]], founder of [[Individual psychology]], psychologists [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].

The [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Carl Menger]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Other noteworthy Austrian-born émigrés include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]], sociologist [[Paul Felix Lazarsfeld]] and scientist [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].

===Literature===
{{See also|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}
[[File:Stefan Zweig2.png|thumb|100px|[[Stefan Zweig]].]]
Complementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Adalbert Stifter]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] and children's author [[Eva Ibbotson]].

Famous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Peter Handke]] and [[Daniel Kehlmann]].

===Food and beverages===
{{Main|Austrian cuisine}}

Austria's cuisine is derived from that of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine ("Hofküche") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the "Mehlspeisen" Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, "Krapfen" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and "Strudel" such as "[[Apfelstrudel]]" filled with apple, "Topfenstrudel" filled with a type of cheese curd called "topfen", and "[[Millirahmstrudel]]" (milk-cream strudel).

In addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Bohemia [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Jewish]], Italian, [[Balkan]] and French cuisine, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.

[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|[[Wiener Schnitzel]]]]

Typical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], Schweinsbraten, [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Knödel]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also Kärntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad. [[Cantharellus|Eierschwammerl]] dishes are also popular. The sugar block dispenser [[Pez]] was invented in Austria, as well as [[Manner (confectionary)|Mannerschnitten]]. Austria is also famous for its [[Mozartkugel]]n and its coffee tradition. With over 8&nbsp;kg per year it has the sixth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Beer is sold in 0.2 litre (a ''Pfiff''), 0.3 litre (a ''Seidel'', ''kleines Bier'' or ''Glas Bier'') and 0.5 litre (a ''Krügerl'' or ''großes Bier'' or ''Halbe'') measures. At festivals one litre ''Maß'' and two litre ''Doppelmaß'' in the [[Bavaria]]n style are also dispensed. The most popular types of beer are [[lager]] (known as ''Märzen'' in Austria), naturally cloudy ''Zwicklbier'' and [[wheat beer]]. At holidays like Christmas and Easter [[bock]] beer is also available.

The most important wine-producing areas are in [[Lower Austria]], [[Burgenland]], [[Styria]] and Vienna. The [[Grüner Veltliner]] grape provides some of Austria's most notable white wines<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-209-gruner-veltliner |title=Gruner Veltliner Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher}}</ref> and [[Zweigelt]] is the most widely planted red wine grape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-645-zweigelt |title=Zweigelt Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher}}</ref>

In [[Upper Austria]], Lower Austria, Styria and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], ''Most'', a type of [[cider]] or [[perry]] is widely produced.

[[Schnapps]] of typically up to 60% alcohol or fruit [[brandy]] is drunk, which in Austria is made from a variety of fruits, for example [[apricot]]s and [[rowan]]berries. The produce of small private schnapps [[distillery|distilleries]], of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as ''Selbstgebrannter'' or ''Hausbrand''.

Local soft drinks such as [[Almdudler]] are very popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages. Another popular drink is the so-called "Spezi", a mix between Coca-Cola and the original formula of [[Fanta|Orange Fanta]] or the more locally renowned [[Frucade]].{{cn|date=January 2019}} [[Red Bull]], the highest-selling energy drink in the world, was introduced by [[Dietrich Mateschitz]], an Austrian entrepreneur.

===Sports===

Due to the mountainous terrain, [[alpine skiing]] is a prominent sport in Austria and is extremely valuable in the promotion and economic growth of the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horak|first=Roman|last2=Spitaler|first2=Georg|year=2003|title=Sport, Space and National Identity: Soccer and Skiing as Formative Forces: On the Austrian Example|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=46|issue=11|pages=1508–18|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764203046011004}}</ref> Similar sports such as [[snowboarding]] or [[ski-jumping]] are also widely popular. Austrian athletes such as [[Annemarie Moser-Pröll]], [[Franz Klammer]], [[Hermann Maier]], [[Toni Sailer]], [[Benjamin Raich]], [[Marlies Schild]] & [[Marcel Hirscher]] are widely regarded as some of the greatest alpine skiers of all time, [[Armin Kogler]], [[Andreas Felder]], [[Ernst Vettori]], [[Andreas Goldberger]], [[Andreas Widhölzl]], [[Thomas Morgenstern]] & [[Gregor Schlierenzauer]] as some of the greatest ski jumpers of all time. [[Bobsleigh]], [[luge]], and [[skeleton (sport)|skeleton]] are also popular events with a permanent track located in [[Igls bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track|Igls]], which hosted bobsleigh and luge competitions for the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]] held in [[Innsbruck]].

A popular [[team sport]] in Austria is [[Association football|football]], which is governed by the [[Austrian Football Association]].<ref name="Football">{{cite web|url=http://www.oefb.at/|title=Österreichischer Fußballbund|year=2009|website=ÖFB|language=German|accessdate=17 June 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090628120811/http://www.oefb.at/| archivedate= 28 June 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Austria was among the most successful football playing nations on the European continent placing 4th at the [[1934 FIFA World Cup]], 3rd at the [[1954 FIFA World Cup]] and 7th at the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]]. However, recently Austrian football has not been internationally successful. It also co-hosted the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] with Switzerland. The national Austrian football league is the [[Austrian Bundesliga]], which includes teams such as record-champions [[SK Rapid Wien]], [[FK Austria Wien]], [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and [[Sturm Graz]].

Besides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the [[Austrian Hockey League]] for [[ice hockey]], and the [[Österreichische Basketball Bundesliga]] for basketball. Horseback riding is also popular; the famed [[Spanish Riding School of Vienna]] is located in Vienna.

[[Niki Lauda]] is a former [[Formula One]] driver who was three times F1 World Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. Other known Austrian F1 drivers are for example [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Jochen Rindt]]. Austria also hosts F1 races ([[Austrian Grand Prix]]); now held at [[Red Bull Ring]], in the past also at [[Österreichring]] and [[Zeltweg Airfield]].

[[Thomas Muster]] is a former [[tennis]] player and one of the greatest clay courters of all time. He won the [[1995 French Open]] and in 1996 he was ranked [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|number 1]] in the [[ATP Rankings|ATP Ranking]]. Other known Austrian tennis players are for example [[Horst Skoff]], [[Jürgen Melzer]] and [[Dominic Thiem]].

Sport played a significant role in developing national consciousness and boosting national self-confidence in the early years of the Second Republic after World War II, through events such as the [[Tour of Austria]] cycle race and through sporting successes such as the national football team's run to third at the 1954 World Cup and the performances of Toni Sailer and the rest of the "Kitzbühel Miracle Team" in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marschick |first=Matthias |date=Summer 2011 |title=Austrian Sport and the Challenges of Its Recent Historiography |jstor=10.5406/jsporthistory.38.2.189 |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=189–198 |doi=10.5406/jsporthistory.38.2.189 |doi-broken-date=2019-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Norden |first=Gilbert|date=Spring 2001 |title=Austrian Sport Museums |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801h.pdf |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=87–107|access-date=3 January 2017 }}</ref>

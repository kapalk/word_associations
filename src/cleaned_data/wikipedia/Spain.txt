[[Iberians|Iberian]] cultures along with ancient [[Phoenicia]]n, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Carthaginian Iberia|Carthaginian]] settlements developed on the peninsula until it came under Roman rule around 200 BCE, after which the region was named ''[[Hispania]]'', based on the earlier Phoenician name ''Sp(a)n'' or ''Spania''.<ref name="historiaclasica.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.historiaclasica.com/2007/09/iberia-vs-hispania-origen-etimolgico.html|title=Iberia vs Hispania: Origen etimológico|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227231455/http://www.historiaclasica.com/2007/09/iberia-vs-hispania-origen-etimolgico.html|archivedate=27 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> At the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|end of the Western Roman Empire]] the Germanic tribal confederations migrated from Central Europe, invaded the Iberian peninsula and established relatively independent realms in its western provinces, including the [[Suebi]], [[Alans]] and [[Vandals]]. Eventually, the [[Visigoths]] would forcibly integrate all remaining independent territories in the peninsula, including Byzantine provinces, into the [[Visigothic_Kingdom#Catholic_Kingdom_of_Toledo|Kingdom of Toledo]], which more or less unified politically, ecclesiastically and legally all the former Roman provinces or successor kingdoms of what was then documented as [[Hispania]].

In the early eighth century the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] fell to the [[Moors]] of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Islamic Caliphate]], who arrived to rule most of the peninsula in the year 726, leaving only a handful of small Christian realms in the north and lasting up to seven centuries in the [[Kingdom of Granada]]. This led to many wars during a long reconquering period across the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which led to the creation of [[Kingdom of Leon]], [[Kingdom of Castille]], [[Kingdom of Aragon]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre]] as the main Christian kingdoms to face the invasion. Following the Moorish conquest, Europeans began a gradual process of retaking the region known as the [[Reconquista]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Esparza|first1=José Javier|title=La gesta española : historia de España en 48 estampas, para quienes han olvidado cuál era su nación|date=2007|publisher=Áltera|location=Barcelona|isbn=978-84-96840-14-0|edition=1a.}}</ref> which by the late 15th century culminated in the emergence of Spain as a unified country under the [[Catholic Monarchs]].

== Etymology == <!--Linked-->
The origins of the Roman name ''[[Hispania]]'', from which the modern name ''España'' was derived, are uncertain due to inadequate evidence, although it is documented that the Phoenicians and Carthaginians referred to the region as ''Spania'', therefore the most widely accepted etymology is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]-[[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] one.<ref name="historiaclasica.com" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/espana/20140829/abci-donde-procede-palabra-espana-201408281811.html|title="I-span-ya", el misterioso origen de la palabra España|last=ABC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113170715/http://www.abc.es/espana/20140829/abci-donde-procede-palabra-espana-201408281811.html|archivedate=13 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Down the centuries there have been a number of accounts and hypotheses:
[[File:Dama de Elche (M.A.N. Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lady of Elche]], possibly depicting [[Tanit]], from [[Carthaginian Iberia]], 4th century BC]]

The [[Renaissance]] scholar [[Antonio de Nebrija]] proposed that the word ''Hispania'' evolved from the [[Iberian language|Iberian]] word ''[[Hispalis]]'', meaning "city of the western world".

Jesús Luis Cunchillos argues that the root of the term ''span'' is the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] word ''spy'', meaning "to forge metals". Therefore, ''i-spn-ya'' would mean "the land where metals are forged".<ref>#Linch, John (director), Fernández Castro, María Cruz (del segundo tomo), Historia de España, El País, volumen II, La península Ibérica en época prerromana, p. 40.

''Hispania'' may derive from the poetic use of the term ''Hesperia'', reflecting the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] perception of Italy as a "western land" or "land of the setting sun" (''Hesperia'', ''Ἑσπερία'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) and Spain, being still further west, as ''Hesperia ultima''.<ref name=anthon>{{cite book|last = Anthon

There is the claim that "Hispania" derives from the [[Basque language|Basque]] word ''Ezpanna'' meaning "edge" or "border", another reference to the fact that the Iberian Peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the European continent.<ref name=anthon />

Two 15th-century Spanish Jewish scholars, [[Isaac Abravanel|Don Isaac Abravanel]] and [[Solomon ibn Verga]], gave an explanation now considered folkloric. Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem. Phiros was a [[Greeks|Grecian]] by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain. Phiros became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain. Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, from whom the country of ''España'' (Spain) took its name. Based upon their testimonies, this eponym would have already been in use in Spain by c. 350 BCE.<ref>Abrabanel, ''Commentary on the First Prophets'' (''Pirush Al Nevi'im Rishonim''), end of II Kings, pp. 680–681, Jerusalem 1955 (Hebrew).

Iberia enters written records as a land populated largely by the [[Iberians]], [[Basques]] and [[Celts]]. Early on its coastal areas were settled by [[Phoenicians]] who founded Western Europe's most ancient cities [[Cadiz]] and [[Malaga]]. Phoenician influence expanded as much of the Peninsula was eventually incorporated into the [[Carthaginian Empire]], becoming a major theatre of the [[Punic Wars]] against the expanding [[Roman Empire]]. After an [[Roman conquest of Hispania|arduous conquest]], the peninsula came fully under Roman Rule. During the early Middle Ages it came under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gothic]] rule but later, much of it was conquered by Muslim invaders from North Africa. In a process that took centuries, the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula. The last Muslim state fell in the same year Columbus reached the Americas. A global empire began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for a century and a half, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries.

Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status. The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Prior to the Second World War, Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government, which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy. Eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century, that started a new globalised world with economic and ecological challenges.

The largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the [[Iberians]] and the [[Celts]]. The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula, from the northeast to the southeast. The Celts inhabited much of the inner and Atlantic sides of the peninsula, from the northwest to the southwest. [[Basque people|Basques]] occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas, the Phoenician-influenced [[Tartessos|Tartessians]] culture flourished in the southwest and the [[Lusitanians]] and [[Vettones]] occupied areas in the central west. A number of cities were founded along the coast by [[Phoenicia]]ns, and trading outposts and colonies were established by [[Greek colonies|Greeks]] in the East. Eventually, Phoenician-[[Carthaginians]] expanded inland towards the meseta, however due to the bellicose inland tribes the Carthaginians got settled in the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula.

During the [[Second Punic War]], roughly between 210 and 205&nbsp;BC the expanding [[Roman Republic]] captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast. Although it took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the [[Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula|conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]], they retained control of it for over six centuries. Roman rule was bound together by law, language, and the [[Roman road]].<ref name="hispania">{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 1 Ancient Hispania |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008}}</ref>

The weakening of the Western Roman Empire's jurisdiction in Hispania began in 409, when the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Suebi]] and [[Vandals]], together with the [[Sarmatian]] [[Alans]] entered the peninsula at the invitation of a Roman usurper. These tribes had crossed the [[Rhine]] in early 407 and ravaged [[Gaul]]. The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and northern [[Portugal]] whereas the Vandals established themselves in southern Spain by 420 before crossing over to North Africa in 429 and [[Battle of Carthage (439)|taking]] Carthage in 439. As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.

[[File:Alcazar of Toledo - Toledo, Spain - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], capital of the Visigothic Kingdom]]
The [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]]. These [[Visigoths]], or Western Goths, after [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacking Rome]] under the leadership of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] (410), turned towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with [[Athaulf]] for their leader, and occupied the northeastern portion. [[Wallia]] extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia. [[Theodoric I]] took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], where [[Attila]] was routed. [[Euric]] (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia. Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths. In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman Catholics against the Arianism of the Visigoths, and in the [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|wars]] which ensued [[Alaric II]] and [[Amalaric]] lost their lives.

[[Athanagild]], having risen against King [[Agila]], called in the Byzantines and, in payment for the succour they gave him, ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast (554). [[Liuvigild]] restored the political unity of the peninsula, subduing the Suebians, but the religious divisions of the country, reaching even the royal family, brought on a civil war. [[St. Hermengild]], the king's son, putting himself at the head of the Catholics, was defeated and taken prisoner, and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the Arians. [[Recared]], son of Liuvigild and brother of St. Hermengild, added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father, accepting the Catholic faith in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589). The religious unity established by this council was the basis of that fusion of Goths with Hispano-Romans which produced the Spanish nation. [[Sisebut]] and [[Suintila]] completed the expulsion of the Byzantines from Spain.<ref name=Spain>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spain}}</ref>

Intermarriage between Visigoths and Hispano-Romans was prohibited, though in practice it could not be entirely prevented and was eventually legalised by Liuvigild.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Portugal and the Portuguese Empire: Volume 1, Portugal: From Beginnings to 1807 |date=2009 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-71764-0}}</ref> The Spanish-Gothic scholars such as [[Braulio of Zaragoza]] and [[Isidore of Seville]] played an important role in keeping the classical [[Greco-Roman world|Greek and Roman culture]].

=== Muslim era and Reconquista ===
{{Main|Al-Andalus|Reconquista}}
[[File:Mort de Roland.jpg|thumb|left|The death of the [[Franks|Frankish]] leader [[Roland]] defeated by a [[Basque people|Basque]] and [[Muslim]]-[[Muladi]] ([[Banu Qasi]]) alliance at the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass (778)]] originated the [[Kingdom of Navarre]] led by [[Íñigo Arista of Pamplona|Íñigo Arista]].]]

In the 8th century, nearly all of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquered]] (711–718) by largely [[Moorish]] [[Muslim]] armies from North Africa. These conquests were part of the expansion of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. Only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion.<!--See next section on the Reconquista: citation not needed here--> Legend has it that [[Julian, Count of Ceuta|Count Julian]], the governor of Ceuta, in revenge for the violation of his daughter, [[Florinda la Cava|Florinda]], by King [[Roderic]], invited the Muslims and opened to them the gates of the peninsula.

Under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Christians and [[Jews]] were given the subordinate status of [[dhimmi]]. This status permitted Christians and Jews to practice their religions as ''[[People of the Book]]'' but they were required to pay a special tax and had legal and social rights inferior to those of Muslims.<ref>{{cite book|author=H.

Conversion to [[Islam]] proceeded at an increasing pace. The ''[[muladi|muladíes]]'' (Muslims of ethnic [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] origin) are believed to have formed the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century.<ref>[http://libro.uca.edu/ics/ics5.htm Islamic and Christian Spain in the Early Middle Ages.

The Muslim community in the Iberian Peninsula was itself diverse and beset by social tensions. The [[Berber people]] of North Africa, who had provided the bulk of the invading armies, [[Berber Revolt|clashed with the Arab leadership]] from the Middle East.{{efn|The Berbers soon gave up attempting to settle the harsh lands in the north of the [[Meseta Central]] (Inner Plateau) handed to them by the Arab rulers.}} Over time, large Moorish populations became established, especially in the [[Guadalquivir River]] valley, the coastal plain of [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the [[Ebro River]] valley and (towards the end of this period) in the mountainous region of [[Granada]].<ref name="chap2" />

[[File:Cordoba sal.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque–Cathedral of Córdoba|Great Mosque of Córdoba]] is among the [[List of the oldest mosques|oldest mosque buildings in the world]]]]

[[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]], the capital of the caliphate since [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]], was the largest, richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe. Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished. Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa. Some important philosophers at the time were [[Averroes]], [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Maimonides]]. The [[Romanisation (cultural)|Romanised]] cultures of the Iberian Peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways, giving the region a distinctive culture.<ref name="chap2" /> Outside the cities, where the vast majority lived, the land ownership system from Roman times remained largely intact as Muslim leaders rarely dispossessed landowners and the introduction of new crops and techniques led to an expansion of agriculture introducing new produces which originally came from Asia or the former territories of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Moa|first1=Pío|title=Nueva historia de España : de la II Guerra Púnica al siglo XXI|date=2010|publisher=Esfera de los Libros|location=Madrid|isbn=978-84-9734-952-9|edition=1.}}</ref>

In the 11th century, the Muslim holdings fractured into rival [[Taifa]] states (Arab, Berber, and Slav),<ref>{{cite book |title=Handbook of Medieval Culture, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3RtpCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA237&lpg=&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> allowing the small Christian states the opportunity to greatly enlarge their territories.<ref name="chap2" /> The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the [[Almoravids]] and the [[Almohads]] restored unity upon the Muslim holdings, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes. This re-united Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains.
[[File:Leon (San Isidoro, panteón).jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica of San Isidoro]], [[León (Spain)|León]]]]
The ''[[Reconquista]]'' (Reconquest) was the centuries-long period in which Christian rule was re-established over the Iberian Peninsula. The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the [[Battle of Covadonga]] won by [[Pelagius of Asturias|Don Pelayo]] in 722 and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula. The Christian army's victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]] along the northwestern coastal mountains. Shortly after, in 739, Muslim forces were driven from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], which was to eventually host one of medieval Europe's holiest sites, [[Santiago de Compostela]] and was incorporated into the new Christian kingdom. The [[Kingdom of León]] was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries. In 1188 the first modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in [[León (Spain)|León]] ([[Cortes of León]]). The [[Kingdom of Castile]], formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as strongest kingdom. The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period. The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from [[feudalism]].

Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]], [[Francia|Frankia]] and pushed out of the very southernmost region of France along the seacoast by the 760s. Later, [[Franks|Frankish]] forces established [[Marca Hispanica|Christian counties]] on the southern side of the Pyrenees. These areas were to grow into the kingdoms of [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and [[kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Rinehart |first=Robert |last2=Seeley|first2=Jo Ann Browning |title = A Country Study: Spain – Castile and Aragon |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+es0016) |accessdate=9 August 2008}}</ref> For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian controlled areas of Iberia was along the [[Ebro]] and [[Douro]] valleys.

The [[County of Barcelona]] and the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean. In 1229 [[Majorca]] was conquered, so was [[Valencia]] in 1238. The break-up of [[Al-Andalus]] into the competing taifa kingdoms helped the long embattled Iberian Christian kingdoms gain the initiative. The capture of the strategically central city of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. Following a great Muslim resurgence in the 12th century, the great Moorish strongholds in the south fell to Christian Spain in the 13th century—Córdoba in 1236 and [[Seville]] in 1248. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Marinid]] dynasty of Morocco invaded and established some enclaves on the southern coast but failed in their attempt to re-establish North African rule in Iberia and were soon driven out.

[[File:LibroDesJuegasAlfonXAndCourt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfonso X]], pretender to the [[Holy Roman Empire]] crown and king of the [[Crown of Castile]]]]
From the mid 13th century, literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the Christian peninsular kingdoms, based on Roman and Gothic traditions. An important philosopher from this time is [[Ramon Llull]]. [[Abraham Cresques]] was a prominent Jewish cartographer. [[Roman law]] and its institutions were the model for the legislators. The king [[Alfonso X of Castile]] focused on strengthening this Roman and Gothic past, and also on linking the Iberian Christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval European Christendom. Alfonso worked for being elected emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and published the [[Siete Partidas]] code. The [[Toledo School of Translators]] is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of Toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries, to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from [[Classical Arabic]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Biblical Hebrew|Ancient Hebrew]].

The [[Transmission of the Classics|Islamic transmission of the classics]] is the main [[Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe]]. The [[Old Spanish|Castilian]] language—more commonly known (especially later in history and at present) as "Spanish" after becoming the national language and ''[[lingua franca]]'' of Spain—evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]], as did other [[Romance languages]] of Spain like the [[Old Catalan|Catalan]], [[Astur-Leonese|Asturian]] and [[Galician-Portuguese|Galician]] languages, as well as other Romance languages in Latin Europe. [[Basque language|Basque]], the only non-Romance language in Spain, continued evolving from Early Basque to Medieval. The [[Glosas Emilianenses]] founded in the [[Monasteries of San Millán de la Cogolla|monasteries]] of [[San Millán de la Cogolla]] contain the first written words in both Basque and Spanish, having the first become an influence in the formation of the second as an evolution of Latin.

The Catalans and Aragonese offered themselves to the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Andronicus II Palaeologus]] to [[Catalan campaign in Asia Minor|fight the Turks]]. Having conquered these, they turned their arms against the Byzantines, who treacherously slew their leaders; but for this treachery the Spaniards, under Bernard of Rocafort and Berenguer of Entenca, exacted the terrible penalty celebrated in history as "The Catalan Vengeance" and moreover [[Battle of Halmyros|seized]] the [[Frankish Greece|Frankish]] [[Duchy of Athens]] (1311).<ref name=Spain/> The royal line of Aragon became extinct with [[Martin the Humane]], and the [[Compromise of Caspe]] gave the Crown to the dynasty of Castile, thus preparing the final union.

[[Antisemitism in Spain|Anti-Semitic]] animus accompanied the Reconquista. There were mass killings in Aragon in the mid-14th century, and 12,000 Jews were killed in Toledo.

In 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] were united by the [[Catholic Monarchs|marriage]] of [[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]]. 1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the [[Canary Islands]] and in 1492, the combined forces of Castile and Aragon captured the [[Emirate of Granada]] from its last ruler [[Muhammad XII of Granada|Muhammad XII]], ending the last remnant of a [[Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula|781-year presence]] of Islamic rule in Iberia.

The year 1492 also marked the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in the [[New World]], during a voyage funded by Isabella.

The [[European colonization of the Americas|colonisation of the Americas]] started with ''[[conquistador]]es'' like [[Hernán Cortés]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]]. [[Miscegenation]] was the rule between the native and the Spanish cultures and people. [[Juan Sebastian Elcano]] completed the first voyage around the world in human history, the [[Timeline of the Magellan–Elcano circumnavigation|Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation]]. Florida was colonised by [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] when he founded [[St. Augustine, Florida]] and then [[Spanish assault on French Florida|defeated]] an attempt led by the French Captain [[Jean Ribault]] to establish a French foothold in [[Spanish Florida]] territory. St. Augustine became a strategic defensive base for Spanish ships full of gold and silver sailing to Spain. [[Andrés de Urdaneta]] discovered the [[tornaviaje]] or return route from the Philippines to Mexico, making possible the [[Manila galleon]] trading route. The Spanish once again encountered Islam, but this time in [[Southeast Asia]] and in order to incorporate the [[Philippines]], Spanish expeditions organised from newly Christianised [[Mexico]] had [[Castilian War|invaded]] the Philippine territories of the [[Sultanate of Brunei]].

With their wide-ranging political, legal, religious and military reforms, Spain emerged as the first [[Historical powers#Spanish Empire|world power]].

[[File:Doña María Pacheco después de Villalar (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|left|[[María Pacheco]], last leader of [[Revolt of the Comuneros]], one of the first modern revolutions]]
There were two big revolts against the new Habsburg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperial-style crown: [[Revolt of the Comuneros]] in [[Castile (historical region)|Castile]] and [[Revolt of the Brotherhoods]] in [[Majorca]] and [[Valencia]]. After years of combat, Comuneros [[Juan López de Padilla]], [[Juan Bravo]] and [[Francisco Maldonado]] were executed and [[María Pacheco]] went into exile. [[Germaine of Foix|Germana de Foix]] also finished with the revolt in the Mediterranean.

[[Habsburg Spain]] was Europe's leading power throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world's leading [[Spanish Navy|maritime power]]. It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two [[Spanish Habsburgs]]—[[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] (1516–1556) and [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] (1556–1598). This period saw the [[Italian Wars]], the [[Schmalkaldic War]], the [[Dutch Revolt]], the [[War of the Portuguese Succession]], clashes with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], intervention in the [[French Wars of Religion]] and the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 13 The Spanish Empire|publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008}}</ref>

[[File:Spanish Empire Complete.svg|thumb|upright=1.56|Anachronous map of the Spanish Empire, including territorial claims]]
Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the [[Spanish Empire]] expanded to include vast areas in the Americas, islands in the Asia-Pacific area, areas of Italy, cities in Northern Africa, as well as parts of what are now France, Germany, [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]]. The [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|first circumnavigation]] of the world was carried out in 1519–1521. It was the first empire on which it was said that [[the empire on which the sun never sets|the sun never set]]. This was an [[Age of Discovery]], with daring explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new [[trade route]]s across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European [[colonialism]]. Spanish explorers brought back [[precious metal]]s, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants, and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Thomas (writer) |title = Rivers of gold: the rise of the Spanish Empire |publisher=George Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year=2003 |location=London |pages=''passim''|isbn=978-0-297-64563-4}}</ref> The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the [[Spanish Golden Age]]. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations. The rise of [[humanism]], the [[Counter-Reformation]] and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the [[School of Salamanca]], which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as [[international law]] and human rights. [[Juan Luis Vives]] was another prominent humanist during this period.

[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|thumb|left|Following the [[Peace of Westphalia]], major Catholic countries like Spain, [[Poland]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] lost their influence and the [[Habsburg]] supremacy curtailed]]
Spain's 16th century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the Ottomans at [[Battle of Lepanto|Lepanto]] in 1571, and then after the setback of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588, in a series of victories against [[England]] in the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604]]. However, during the middle decades of the 17th century Spain's maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and then England; that by the 1660s it was struggling grimly to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers.

The [[Protestant Reformation]] dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars. The result was a country forced into ever expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|title=The Seventeenth-Century Decline|accessdate=13 August 2008|publisher=The Library of Iberian resources online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921003150/http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/payne15.htm|archivedate=21 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> By the middle decades of a war- and [[Great Plague of Seville|plague]]-ridden 17th-century Europe, the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts. These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally. Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered [[Habsburg empire]], and help the imperial forces of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the [[Portuguese Restoration War|separation of Portugal]] and the United Provinces, and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide [[Thirty Years' War]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Payne |first=Stanley G. |title = A History of Spain and Portugal; Ch. 14 Spanish Society and Economics in the Imperial Age |publisher=The Library of Iberian Resources Online |year=1973 |url=http://libro.uca.edu/payne1/spainport1.htm |accessdate=9 August 2008}}</ref> In the latter half of the 17th century, Spain went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to France and England; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.

[[File:La familia de Felipe V (Van Loo).jpg|thumb|[[The Family of Philip V (1743)|The Family of Philip V]]. During the [[Enlightenment in Spain]] a new royal family reigned, the [[House of Bourbon]].]]
The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The [[War of the Spanish Succession]] was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rinehart |first=Robert |last2=Seeley |first2=Jo Ann Browning |title=A Country Study: Spain – Spain in Decline |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |accessdate=9 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809003309/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |archivedate=9 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]], was installed. Long united only by the Crown, a true Spanish state was established when the first Bourbon king, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]], united the crowns of Castile and Aragon into a single state, abolishing many of the old regional privileges and laws.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rinehart |first=Robert |last2=Seeley |first2=Jo Ann Browning |title=A Country Study: Spain – Bourbon Spain |publisher=Library of Congress Country Series |year=1998 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |accessdate=9 August 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080809003309/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/estoc.html |archivedate=9 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire. The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy. [[Enlightenment in Spain|Enlightenment]] ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy. [[Bourbon Reforms|Bourbon reformers]] created formal disciplined militias across the Atlantic. Spain needed every hand it could take during the seemingly endless wars of the eighteenth century—the Spanish War of Succession or [[Queen Anne's War]] (1702–13), the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] (1739–42) which became the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740–48), the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–63) and the [[Spain and the American Revolutionary War|Anglo-Spanish War]] (1779–83)—and its new disciplined militias served around the Atlantic as needed.

[[File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Third of May 1808]]'' by [[Francisco de Goya]] depicts an episode of the [[Peninsular War|Spanish Independence War]].]]

In 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new [[First French Republic|French Republic]] as a member of [[War of the First Coalition|the first Coalition]]. The subsequent [[War of the Pyrenees]] polarised the country in a reaction against the [[Francization|gallicised]] elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the [[Peace of Basel]] in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of [[Hispaniola]]. The Prime Minister, [[Manuel Godoy, Prince of the Peace|Manuel Godoy]], then ensured that Spain allied herself with France in the brief [[War of the Third Coalition]] which ended with the British naval victory at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal. Napoleon's troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses. The Spanish king abdicated in favour of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte]].

Joseph Bonaparte was seen as a [[puppet monarch]] and was regarded with scorn by the Spanish. The [[Dos de Mayo Uprising|2 May 1808 revolt]] was one of many nationalist uprisings across the country against the Bonapartist regime.<ref>David A. Bell. "[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091006185459/http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/napoleonic_wars/6361907.html?page=2&c=y Napoleon's Total War]".

Napoleon was forced to intervene personally, defeating several Spanish armies and forcing a British army to retreat. However, further military action by Spanish armies, [[guerrilla]]s and [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington's]] British-Portuguese forces, combined with Napoleon's disastrous [[Napoleon's Invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]], led to the ousting of the French imperial armies from Spain in 1814, and the return of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|King Ferdinand VII]].<ref>(Gates 2001, p.467)</ref>

[[File:Cortes de cadiz.jpg|thumb|right|The Proclamation of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] in [[Cádiz]]]]

These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Spain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government's policies that favoured Spanish-born citizens ([[Peninsulars]]) over those born overseas ([[Criollo people|Criollos]]) and demanded [[retroversion of the sovereignty to the people]]. Starting in 1809 Spain's American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] that ended Spanish control over its mainland colonies in the Americas. King Ferdinand VII's attempt to [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|re-assert control]] proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and [[Ferdinand VII of Spain#Revolt|army revolts]] followed, led by liberal officers. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]].

The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s Anti-liberal forces known as [[Carlism|Carlists]] fought against liberals in the [[Carlist Wars]]. Liberal forces won, but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period. After the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868 and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]], a more stable [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchic period began]] characterised by the practice of ''turnismo'' (the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the Spanish government).

[[File:Semana tragica.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in Barcelona after the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] events]]

In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the [[Cuban War of Independence]] and the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out and eventually<!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--> the United States became involved. The [[Spanish–American War]] was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]] who were conducting an analysis of the country.

Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little peace; Spain played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]], with the colonisation of [[Western Sahara]], [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It remained neutral during World War I (see [[Spain in World War I]]). The heavy losses suffered during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.

After a period of authoritarian rule under General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] (1923–1931), the king determined to seek a solution to the political situation and establish the Constitution, the king led the municipal elections on 12 April 1931. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, while the total number of councillors was mostly monarchical. The organised demonstrations demanding the establishment of a democratic republic led the king to leave the country and the proclamation of the same on 14 April of that same year. During the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. The moderate leaders were boycotted and each party intended to create a Spain to suit them. During the first two years, governed a coalition of republican and socialist parties. In the elections held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. The violent acts during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|monarchical uprising of the militar José Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms are initiated to modernise the country – democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, first Statutes of Autonomy ... – and the rights of citizens as the recognition of [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]], establishing [[universal suffrage]].

On 17 July and 18, 1936, [[Spanish coup of July 1936|revolted]] against the government of the Republic, the military garrisons of the Spanish North Africa, coup d'état that triumphs only in part country. Spain was divided into two zones: one under the authority of the Republican government — in which the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|social revolution of 1936]] – and other [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|controlled by the insurgents]] took place. The situation led to a [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], in which the general [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the insurgents.

For three years the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] forces led by General [[Francisco Franco]] and supported by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922–1943)|Fascist Italy]] fought the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side, which was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], Mexico and [[International Brigades]] but it was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of [[non-intervention]].

The [[Spanish Civil War|war]] claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_corrisedrespondent/2809025.stm Spanish Civil War fighters look back], BBC News, 23 February 2003</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |title=Relatives of Spaniards who fled Franco granted citizenship |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 December 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723074619/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |archivedate=23 July 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1939, General Franco emerged victorious and became a dictator.

The [[Francoist Spain|state as established under Franco]] was nominally [[neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] in the Second World War, although [[Spain in World War II|sympathetic]] to [[Axis Powers|the Axis]]. The only legal party under Franco's post civil war regime was the ''[[Falange]] Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS'', formed in 1937; the party emphasised [[falangism]], a form of fascism that emphasised [[anti-communism]], nationalism and [[Roman Catholicism]]. Given Franco's opposition to competing political parties, the party was renamed the National Movement (''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'') in 1949.

After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the [[Cold War]] period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. In the 1960s, Spain registered an [[Spanish miracle|unprecedented rate of economic growth]] which was propelled by [[Spanish miracle#Industrialisation|industrialisation]], a [[Spanish miracle#Rural exodus|mass internal migration]] from rural areas to [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the creation of a [[Spanish miracle#Mass tourism|mass tourism industry]]. Franco's rule was also characterised by [[Francoist Spain#Authoritarianism|authoritarianism]], [[Francoist Spain#Nationalism|promotion of a unitary national identity]], the favouring of a very conservative form of Roman Catholicism known as [[National Catholicism]], and [[Language policies of Francoist Spain|discriminatory language policies]].

=== Restoration of democracy ===

In 1962, a group of politicians involved in the opposition to Franco's regime inside the country and in exile met in the congress of the [[European Movement]] in Munich, where they made a resolution in favour of democracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/09/actualidad/1339259231_174858.html|title=El contubernio que preparó la democracia|work=EL PAÍS|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405102702/http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/09/actualidad/1339259231_174858.html|archivedate=5 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movimientoeuropeo.org/area-prensa/actividades/Contubernio-Munich-50-aniversario.php |title=Contubernio de Múnich: 50 años |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021124653/http://www.movimientoeuropeo.org/area-prensa/actividades/Contubernio-Munich-50-aniversario.php |archivedate=21 October 2014 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lavanguardia.com/hemeroteca/20120605/54303390132/contubernio-munich-politica-oposicion-antifranquista-movimiento-europeo.html|title=El contubernio de Munich|work=La Vanguardia}}</ref>

With Franco's death in November 1975, [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] succeeded to the position of [[King of Spain]] and [[head of state]] in accordance with the franquist law. With the approval of the new [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] and the [[Spanish transition to democracy|restoration of democracy]], the State [[devolution|devolved]] much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]]. The [[Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law]] let people of Franco's regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the [[Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria]] or [[1977 Massacre of Atocha]]. The 'founding chairman' of the current leading political party in Spain, the [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]], was [[Manuel Fraga Iribarne|Manuel Fraga]] who had been a minister in Franco's government and yet continued with his political career until shortly before his death in 2012.

On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose [[23-F|a military-backed government]]. King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.

During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like [[La Movida Madrileña]] and a culture of human rights arose with [[Gregorio Peces-Barba]]. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined [[NATO]], followed by [[Spanish NATO membership referendum, 1986|a referendum]] after a strong social opposition. That year the [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986 Spain joined the [[European Economic Community]], which later became the [[European Union]]. The PSOE was replaced in government by the [[People's Party (Spain)|Partido Popular]] (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of [[Felipe González]] in the [[GAL (paramilitary group)|Dirty war against ETA]]; at that point the PSOE had served almost 14 consecutive years in office.

On 1 January 2002, Spain fully adopted the [[euro]], and Spain experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s. However, well-publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-a10_18.html?scp=1&sq=Economy%20reaps%20benefits%20of%20entry%20to%20the%20%27club%27%20:%20Spain%27s%20euro%20bonanza&st=cse|title=Economy reaps benefits of entry to the 'club' : Spain's euro bonanza|work=International Herald Tribune|accessdate=9 August 2008|date=11 July 2002|author=Pfanner, Eric|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501090321/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/business/worldbusiness/11iht-a10_18.html?scp=1&sq=Economy%20reaps%20benefits%20of%20entry%20to%20the%20%27club%27%20:%20Spain%27s%20euro%20bonanza&st=cse|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=dmy-all}} See also: {{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9118701|title=Spain's economy / Plain sailing no longer|work=The Economist|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=9 August 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613212911/http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=9118701|archivedate=13 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

At {{convert|505992|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, Spain is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by area|fifty-second largest country]] and [[Area and population of European countries|Europe's fourth largest country]]. It is some {{convert|47000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} smaller than France and {{convert|81000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} larger than the US state of California. Mount [[Teide]] ([[Tenerife]]) is the highest mountain peak in Spain and is the third largest volcano in the world from its base. Spain is a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental country]], having territory in both [[Europe]] and [[Africa]].

Spain lies between latitudes [[26th parallel north|26°]] and [[44th parallel north|44° N]], and longitudes [[19th meridian west|19° W]] and [[5th meridian east|5° E]].

On the west, Spain is bordered by [[Portugal]]; on the south, it is bordered by [[Gibraltar]] (a [[British overseas territory]]) and [[Morocco]], through its [[exclave]]s in North Africa ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]], and the peninsula of [[Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera|Vélez de la Gomera]]). On the northeast, along the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range, it is bordered by France and the [[Principality]] of [[Andorra]]. Along the Pyrenees in [[province of Girona|Girona]], a small exclave town called [[Llívia]] is surrounded by France.

[[File:Circo de Soaso.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park]], [[World Heritage Site]] in the [[Pyrenees]]]]

Mainland Spain is a [[mountainous]] country, dominated by high [[plateau]]s and mountain chains. After the Pyrenees, the main mountain ranges are the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cordillera Cantábrica]] (Cantabrian Range), [[Sistema Ibérico]] (Iberian System), [[Sistema Central]] (Central System), [[Montes de Toledo]], [[Sierra Morena]] and the [[Sistema Bético]] (Baetic System) whose highest peak, the {{convert|3478|m|ft|adj=mid|abbr=off|-high}} [[Mulhacén]], located in [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]], is the highest elevation in the Iberian Peninsula. The highest point in Spain is the [[Teide]], a {{convert|3718|m|ft|adj=on}} active [[volcano]] in the Canary Islands. The [[Meseta Central]] (often translated as "Inner Plateau") is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular Spain.

There are several major [[rivers in Spain]] such as the [[Tagus]] (''Tajo''), [[Ebro]], [[Guadiana River|Guadiana]], [[Douro]] (''Duero''), [[Guadalquivir]], [[Júcar River|Júcar]], [[Segura]], [[Turia River|Turia]] and [[Minho River|Minho]] (''Miño''). [[Alluvial plain]]s are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in [[Andalusia]].

* The [[Mediterranean climate]], characterised by warm/hot and dry summers, is dominant in the peninsula. It has two varieties: ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]].
** The ''Csa'' zone is associated to areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout [[Andalusia]], Extremadura and much, if not most, of the centre of the country. The ''Csa'' zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level, reason for which Köppen classification is often eschewed within Spain. Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures.
** The ''Csb'' zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western [[Castile and León|Castile–León]], northeastern [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and northern [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]) and into much rainier areas (notably [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]). Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic.
* The [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', ''BSh''), is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain. It covers most of the [[Region of Murcia]], southern [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the [[Ebro]] valley, which crosses southern [[Navarre]], central Aragon and western Catalonia. It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and some locations of western Andalusia. The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.
* The [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region ([[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Cantabria, [[Asturias]], and partly Galicia and Castile–León). Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian System]] and in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (''Cfa'') also occurs. Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.

Apart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the [[alpine climate]] in areas with very high altitude, the [[humid subtropical climate]] in areas of northeastern Spain and the [[continental climate]]s (''Dfc'', ''Dfb'' / ''Dsc'', ''Dsb'') in the [[Pyrenees]] as well as parts of the [[Cordillera Cantábrica|Cantabrian Range]], the [[Sistema Central|Central System]], [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian System]], and a typical [[desert climate]] (''BWk'', ''BWh'') in the zone of Almería, Murcia and eastern [[Canary Islands]]. Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above {{convert|18.0|C|1}} during their coldest month, thus having a [[tropical climate]].

=== Fauna and flora ===
[[File:Iberian Wolf AdF 001.jpg|thumb|[[Iberian wolf]] in [[Castile and Leon]]. The region has the 25% of the land covered by [[Natura 2000]] protected natural spaces.]]

The [[fauna]] presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and [[Eurasia]], and the great diversity of habitats and [[biotopes]], the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.

The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief, the climate and [[latitude]]. Spain includes different [[phytogeographic]] regions, each with its own floristic characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, [[Biotic component|biotic]] factors.

According to the [[Democracy Index]] of the EIU, Spain is one of the 19 full democracies in the world.

The Spanish Constitution of 1978 is the culmination of the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].
The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812. Impatient with the slow pace of democratic political reforms in 1976 and 1977, Spain's new King [[Juan Carlos]], known for his formidable personality, dismissed [[Carlos Arias Navarro]] and appointed the reformer [[Adolfo Suárez]] as Prime Minister.<ref name="From Dictatorship to Democracy">John Hooper, ''The New Spaniards'', 2001, ''From Dictatorship to Democracy''</ref><ref name="Spain's fast-living king turns 70">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7171971.stm Spain's fast-living king turns 70] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106025042/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7171971.stm |date=6 January 2010 }} BBC News Friday, 4 January 2008 Extracted 18 June 2009</ref> The resulting [[Spanish general election, 1977|general election in 1977]] convened the ''[[Constituent Cortes]]'' (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.senado.es/constitu_i/index.html |title=Spanish Constitution |publisher=Senado.es |accessdate=1 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104013009/http://www.senado.es/constitu_i/index.html |archivedate=4 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Political divisions of Spain}}

The Spanish State is divided into 17 autonomous communities and 2 autonomous cities, both groups being the highest or first-order administrative division in the country. Autonomous communities are divided into provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are divided into municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the ''comarques'' (sing. ''comarca'') and the ''vegueries'' (sing. ''vegueria'') both of which have administrative powers; ''comarques'' being aggregations of municipalities, and the ''vegueries'' being aggregations of ''comarques''. The concept of a ''comarca'' exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.

==== Autonomous communities ====
{{Main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}
{{See also|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}
{{Autonomous regions of Spain|float=right}}

Spain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the "[[nationalities and regions of Spain|''nationalities'' and regions of Spain]]".<ref>Article 143 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution in reference to Article 2</ref> The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economical traits. This territorial organisation, based on [[devolution]], is literally known in Spain as the "State of Autonomies".

The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the [[Statute of Autonomy]]. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Chapter 3. Autonomous Communities. 147th Article]. ''Spanish Constitution of 1978''. Retrieved 10 December 2007</ref>

The governments of all autonomous communities must be based on a division of powers and comprise
* a legislative assembly whose members must be elected by [[universal suffrage]] according to the system of [[proportional representation]] and in which all areas that integrate the territory are fairly represented;
* a government council, with executive and administrative functions headed by a president, elected by the Legislative Assembly and nominated by the [[King of Spain]];
* a supreme court, under the supreme court of Spain, which heads the judiciary in the autonomous community.

Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as ''nationalities'', were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance to their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |title=Estatut |format=PDF |language=es |accessdate=20 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326021746/http://www.trobat.com/recursos/estatut-valencia.pdf |archivedate=26 March 2009}}</ref> the Canary Islands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html#pre |title=Nuevo Estatuto de Autonomía de Canarias |publisher=.gobiernodecanarias.org |accessdate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120074716/http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/tuestatuto/novedades.html |archivedate=20 January 2011}}</ref> the Balearic Islands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |title=BOCAe32.QXD |format=PDF |language=ca |accessdate=20 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711090828/http://www.caib.es/webcaib/govern_illes/estatut_autonomia/doc/estatut2007.ca.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2009}}</ref> and Aragon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&tipo=2&ini=1&fin=10&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |title=Estatuto de Autonomía de Aragón |publisher=Narros.congreso.es |accessdate=20 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211225055/http://narros.congreso.es/constitucion/estatutos/estatutos.jsp?com=64&tipo=2&ini=1&fin=10&ini_sub=1&fin_sub=1 |archivedate=11 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. Only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy. Aside of fiscal autonomy, the ''nationalities''—Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: [[Ertzaintza]], [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] and the [[Policía Foral]] respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the ''Policía Autónoma Andaluza''<ref name="cartujo">{{cite web|url=http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|title=Unidad de Policía de la Comunidad Autónoma de Andalucía|publisher=Cartujo.org|accessdate=23 October 2007|language=es|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107145807/http://www.cartujo.org/pag(a9).htm|archivedate=7 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> in [[Andalusia]] or the [[BESCAM]] in Madrid.

Nonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the ''nationalities'' and the rest of the regions.

Finally, along with the 17 autonomous communities, two autonomous cities are also part of the State of Autonomies and are first-order territorial divisions: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.

==== Provinces and municipalities ====
{{Main|Provinces of Spain|Municipalities of Spain}}

Autonomous communities are divided into [[Provinces of Spain|provinces]], which served as their territorial building blocks. In turn, provinces are divided into [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]]. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Articles 140 and 141]. Spanish Constitution of 1978</ref>

The current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the [[1833 territorial division of Spain|1833 territorial division]] by [[Javier de Burgos]], and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.

After the return of democracy following the death of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] in 1975, Spain's [[foreign policy]] priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the [[Spain under Franco|Franco years]] and expand [[diplomatic relations]], enter the [[European Union|European Community]], and define security relations with the West.

As a member of [[NATO]] since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities. Spain's EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy. Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to co-ordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political co-operation mechanisms.{{vague|date=March 2015}}

Spain has maintained its special relations with [[Hispanic America]] and the [[Philippines]]. Its policy emphasizes the concept of an [[Ibero-America]]n community, essentially the renewal of the concept of ''"[[Hispanidad]]"'' or ''"[[Hispanism]]o"'', as it is often referred to in English, which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language, commerce, history and culture. It is fundamentally "based on shared values and the recovery of democracy."<ref>Garcia Cantalapiedra, David, and Ramon Pacheco Pardo, ''Contemporary Spanish Foreign Policy'' (Routledge, 2014).

While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain asserts that the "occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of [[International Law]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Londres/es/MenuPpal/Gibraltar/Documents/000.001.002.003%20Título.%20Prefacio.Índice.%20Informe%20(27.02.08).doc |title=La cuestión de Gibraltar |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain |date=January 2008 |accessdate=3 January 2010 |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529192351/http://www.maec.es/subwebs/Embajadas/Londres/es/MenuPpal/Gibraltar/Documents/000.001.002.003%20T%C3%ADtulo.%20Prefacio.%C3%8Dndice.%20Informe%20%2827.02.08%29.doc |archivedate=29 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The United Kingdom relies on ''de facto'' arguments of possession by [[prescription (sovereignty transfer)|prescription]] in relation to the isthmus,<ref>{{cite book |title=Gibraltar: British or Spanish? |author=Peter Gold |publisher=Routledge |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-415-34795-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=u9YH_fLPu1MC |page=4}}</ref> as there has been "continuous possession [of the isthmus] over a long period".<ref>{{cite web|author=UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs |year=1999 |url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/OT13.pdf |title=Partnership for Progress and Prosperity: Britain and the Overseas Territories.

Another claim by Spain is about the [[Savage Islands]], part of [[Portugal]]. In clash with the Portuguese position, Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, and therefore Spain does not accept any extension of the Portuguese [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (200 nautical miles) generated by the islands, while acknowledging the ''Selvagens'' having [[territorial waters]] (12 nautical miles). On 5 July 2013, Spain sent a letter to the UN expressing these views.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|title=Spain's letter to the UN|publisher=UN|fdate=|date=September 2013|language=Spanish|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525185334/http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/submissions_files/prt44_09/esp_re_prt2013.pdf|archivedate=25 May 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>[http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/spain-disputes-portugal-islands/29269 "Spain disputes Portugal islands"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908225016/http://www.theportugalnews.com/news/spain-disputes-portugal-islands/29269 |date=8 September 2013 }} ''[[The Portugal News]]''.

Spain claims the sovereignty over the [[Perejil Island]], a small, uninhabited rocky [[islet]] located in the South shore of the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. The island lies {{convert|250|m|ft}} just off the coast of Morocco, {{convert|8|km|mi}} from [[Ceuta]] and {{convert|13.5|km|mi}} from mainland Spain. Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco. It was the subject of an armed incident between the two countries in 2002. The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island. The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.

Besides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the ''[[plazas de soberanía]]'' islets off the northern coast of Africa. Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of [[Olivenza]] which was annexed by Spain in 1801 after the [[War of the Oranges]]. Portugal stance has been the territory being ''de iure'' Portuguese territory and ''de facto'' Spanish.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=La cuestión de Olivenza, a la luz del Derecho internacional público|last=Fernández Liesa|first=Carlos R.|publisher=Ayuntamiento de Olivenza|year=2004|pages=234–235|journal=Encuentros: revista luso-española de investigadores en Ciencias humanas y sociales.

Since 1996, CO2 emissions have risen notably, not reaching the reduction emissions promised in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] for fighting [[climate change]]. In the period 1880–2000 more than half of the years have been qualified as dry or very dry. Spain is the country in Europe more exposed to climate change effects, according to [[Al Gore]].

Electricity from renewable sources in Spain represented 42.8% of electricity demand coverage during 2014. The country has a very large wind power capability built up over many years and is one of the world leaders in wind power generation. Spain also positioned itself as a European leader in Solar power, by 2007–2010 the country was second only to Germany in installed capacity.

[[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] was awarded with the [[European Green Capital]] in 2012 after implementining good practices by the [[Agenda 21]] and recovering [[Salburua]] wetland, protected by [[Ramsar Convention]] and [[Natura 2000]] and a part of [[Green Belt of Vitoria-Gasteiz]], funded partially with [[The LIFE Programme]].

By the mid-1990s the economy had recommenced the growth that had been disrupted by the global recession of the early 1990s. The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment rate began to steadily decline. With the government budget in balance and inflation under control Spain was admitted into the Eurozone in 1999.

Since the 1990s some Spanish companies have gained multinational status, often expanding their activities in culturally close Latin America. Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there, after the United States.

===Automotive industry===
{{Main article|Automotive industry in Spain}}

The automotive industry is one of the largest employers in the country. In 2015 Spain was the 8th largest automobile producer country in the world and the 2nd largest car manufacturer in Europe after Germany.<ref name=WSJ>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-makers-pour-money-into-spain-1470613487 Car Makers Pour Money Into Spain | WSJ]</ref>

By 2016, the automotive industry was generating 8.7 percent of Spain's [[gross domestic product]], employing about nine percent of the manufacturing industry.<ref name=WSJ/> By 2008 the automobile industry was the 2nd most exported industry<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investinspain.org/icex/cda/controller/interes/0,5464,5322992_6261564_6278959_0,00.html |title=>> Spain in numbers |publisher=Invest in Spain |date= |accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref> while in 2015 about 80% of the total production was for export.<ref name=WSJ/>

German companies poured €4.8 billion into Spain in 2015, making the country the second-largest destination for German [[foreign direct investment]] behind only the U.S. The lion’s share of that investment —€4 billion— went to the country’s auto industry.<ref name=WSJ/>

=== Agriculture ===
{{Main|Agriculture in Spain}}

Crop areas were farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (''secano''), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (''regadío'') accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in [[Province of Almería|Almería]]—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.

[[File:Viñedos en Briñas.jpg|thumb|A [[vineyard]] of [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]]]]

Though only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40–45% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in [[maize|corn]], [[fruit tree]]s, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, [[sugar beet]]s, potatoes, [[legume]]s, [[olive tree]]s, mangos, [[strawberries]], tomatoes, and [[fodder]] grasses. Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.

[[Citrus fruit]]s, vegetables, [[cereal grain]]s, [[olive oil]], and wine—Spain's traditional agricultural products—continued to be important in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and [[dairy product]]s. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did [[sunflower seed oil]] that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]].

In the 19th and 20th centuries science in Spain was held back by severe political instability and consequent economic underdevelopment. Despite the conditions, some important scientists and engineers emerged. The most notable were [[Miguel Servet]], [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]], [[Narcís Monturiol]], [[Celedonio Calatayud]], [[Juan de la Cierva]], [[Leonardo Torres y Quevedo]], [[Margarita Salas]] and [[Severo Ochoa]].

The [[Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas]] (CSIC) is the leading public agency dedicated to scientific research in the country. It ranked as the 5th top governmental scientific institution worldwide (and 32nd overall) in the 2018 SCImago Institutions Rankings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scimagoir.com/rankings.php?sector=all|title=Scimago Institution Rankings|accessdate=5 January 2018}}</ref>

With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, [[Madrid]], the most populated areas lie around the coast. The population of Spain has risen  2 1/2 times  since 1900, when it stood at 18.6&nbsp;million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.<ref>Joseph Harrison, David Corkill (2004).

Native [[Spaniards]] make up 88% of the total population of Spain. After the [[List of countries and territories by fertility rate|birth rate]] plunged in the 1980s and Spain's population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward initially upon the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population. The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (4%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/axi?AXIS_PATH=/inebase/temas/t20/e245/p04/a2005/l0/&FILE_AXIS=00000010.px&CGI_DEFAULT=/inebase/temas/cgi.opt&COMANDO=SELECCION&CGI_URL=/inebase/cgi/ |publisher=Instituto Nacional de Estadística |title=Población extranjera por sexo, país de nacionalidad y edad |accessdate=13 August 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325043135/http://www.ine.es/inebase/cgi/axi?AXIS_PATH=%2Finebase%2Ftemas%2Ft20%2Fe245%2Fp04%2Fa2005%2Fl0%2F&FILE_AXIS=00000010.px&CGI_DEFAULT=%2Finebase%2Ftemas%2Fcgi.opt&COMANDO=SELECCION&CGI_URL=%2Finebase%2Fcgi%2F |archivedate=25 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> In 2005, Spain instituted a three-month amnesty programme through which certain hitherto undocumented aliens were granted legal residency.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politica.elpais.com/politica/2012/06/09/actualidad/1339259231_174858.html|title=700.000 inmigrantes en la mayor regularización en España|work=EL PAÍS|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180523100256/https://elpais.com/diario/2005/05/08/portada/1115503207_850215.html|archivedate=23 May 2018|date=8 May 2005|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam,<ref>[https://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-1992-24855 Ley 26/1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126142129/http://www.boe.es/diario_boe/txt.php?id=BOE-A-1992-24855 |date=26 November 2016 }}, Documento BOE-A-1992-24855, Agencia Estatal Boletín Oficial del Estado</ref> Judaism,<ref>[https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1992-24854 Ley 25/1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227231842/https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1992-24854 |date=27 December 2016 }}, Documento BOE-A-1992-24854, Agencia Estatal Boletín Oficial del Estado</ref> and evangelical Christianity<ref>[https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1992-24853 Ley 24/1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161126142109/http://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1992-24853 |date=26 November 2016 }}, Documento BOE-A-1992-24853, Agencia Estatal Boletín Oficial del Estado</ref> is also recognised in law. According to a June 2016 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research about 70% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, 2% other faith, and about 25% identify with [[irreligion|no religion]]. Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services.

Altogether, about 9% of the entire Spanish population attends religious services at least once per month.<ref name=CIS /> Though Spanish society has become considerably more secular in recent decades, the influx of Latin American immigrants, who tend to be strong Catholic practitioners, has helped the Catholic Church to recover. The Spanish constitution enshrines [[secularism]] in governance, as well as freedom of religion or belief for all, saying that no religion should have a "state character," while allowing for the state to "cooperate" with religious groups. However, significant anomalies remain, including the presence of a [[Blasphemy law#Spain|blasphemy law]] in statute, which theoretically criminalises criticism of religion. A blasphemy prosecution in Spain has happened as recently as 2012.

There have been four Spanish Popes. [[Pope Damasus I|Damasus I]], [[Pope Calixtus III|Calixtus III]], [[Pope Alexander VI|Alexander VI]] and [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]]. Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with [[Carmelites]] like [[Teresa of Ávila]], a [[Counter-Reformation|reformist]] nun and [[John of the Cross]], a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement. Later, they became [[Doctors of the Church]]. The [[Society of Jesus]] was co-founded by [[Ignatius of Loyola]],  whose [[Spiritual Exercises]] and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone. The Society's co-founder, [[Francis Xavier]], was a missionary who reached India and later Japan.  In the 1960s, Jesuits [[Pedro Arrupe]] and [[Ignacio Ellacuría]] supported the movement of [[Liberation Theology]].

[[Protestant]] churches have about 1,200,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ferede.org/general.php?pag=estad#1 |title=Federación de Entidades Religiosas Evangélicas de España – FEREDE |publisher=Ferede.org |accessdate=4 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930083055/http://www.ferede.org/general.php?pag=estad#1 |archivedate=30 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There are about 105,000 [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

A study made by the [[Union of Islamic Communities of Spain]] demonstrated that there were about 1,700,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain {{As of|2012|lc=y}}, accounting for 3–4% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from [[Morocco]] and other African countries. More than 514,000 (30%) of them had Spanish nationality.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Explotación estadística del censo de ciudadanos musulmanes en España referido a fecha 31/12/2012|journal=Unión de Comunidades Islámicas de España|year=2012|pages=6–9|url=http://oban.multiplexor.es/estademograf.pdf|ref=harv|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328084242/http://oban.multiplexor.es/estademograf.pdf|archivedate=28 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The recent waves of immigration have also led to an increasing number of [[Hindus]], [[Buddhists]], [[Sikhs]] and [[Muslims]].
After the Reconquista in 1492, Muslims did not live in Spain for centuries. Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Western Sahara]] full citizenship. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.

[[Judaism]] was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population. Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews. Approximately 80,000 [[Jew]]s are thought to have lived in Spain prior to its expulsion.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Spanish Inquisition: A Historical Revision|year=1999|publisher=Yale University Press|authorlink=Henry Kamen|last=Kamen|first=Henry|pages=29–31}}</ref> However the Jewish Encyclopedia states the number over 800,000 to be too large and 235,000 as too small: 165,000 is given as expelled as possibly too small in favour or 200,000, and the numbers of converts after the 1391 pogroms as less. Other sources suggest 200,000 converts mostly after the pogroms of 1391 and upwards of 100,000 expelled.

The descendants of these Sephardic Jews expelled in 1492 are given the Spanish nationality if they request so.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sanz |first=Juan Carlos |title=Spain at last welcomes back the Sephardim |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/22/inenglish/1453467510_159674.html |date=22 January 2016 |access-date=26 May 2018 |location=Tel Aviv |newspaper=[[El País]]}}</ref>

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Spain}}

Spain is a [[Western world|Western country]]. Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of the major [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin countries]] of Europe. Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity. Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music have been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.

After Italy (54) and China (52), Spain is the third country in the world with the most [[World Heritage Site]]s. At the present time it has 47 recognised sites, including the landscape of [[Monte Perdido]] in the [[Pyrenees]], which is shared with France, the Prehistoric Rock Art Sites of the [[Côa Valley]] and [[Siega Verde]], which is shared with [[Portugal]] (the Portuguese part being in the Côa Valley, [[Guarda District|Guarda]]), the [[Heritage of Mercury.

The earliest recorded examples of vernacular Romance-based literature date from the same time and location, the rich mix of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian cultures in Muslim Spain, in which Maimonides, Averroes, and others worked, the [[Kharja]]s (''Jarchas'').

[[File:Bronze statues of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Bronze statues of [[Don Quixote]] and [[Sancho Panza]] in the [[Plaza de España (Madrid)|Plaza de España]] in Madrid]]

During the [[Reconquista]], the epic poem ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'' was written about a real man—his battles, conquests, and daily life. The Valencian chivalric romance [[Tirant lo Blanch]] written in [[Valencian language|Valencian]] is also remarkable.

Other major plays from the medieval times were ''[[Mester de Juglaría]]'', ''[[Mester de Clerecía]]'', ''[[Coplas por la muerte de su padre]]'' or ''[[The Book of Good Love|El Libro de buen amor]]'' (The Book of Good Love).

During the [[Renaissance]] the major plays are ''[[La Celestina]]'' and ''[[El Lazarillo de Tormes]]'', while many religious literature was created with poets as [[Luis de León]], [[San Juan de la Cruz]], [[Santa Teresa de Jesús]], etc.

The [[Baroque]] is the most important period for Spanish culture. We are in the times of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The famous ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quijote de La Mancha]]'' by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca|Calderón de la Barca]] or [[Tirso de Molina]].

During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] we find names such as [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]], [[Benito Jerónimo Feijóo]], [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] or [[Leandro Fernández de Moratín]].

During the [[Romanticism]], [[José Zorrilla]] created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in [[Don Juan Tenorio]]. Other writers from this period are [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]], [[José de Espronceda]], [[Rosalía de Castro]] or [[Mariano José de Larra]].

In [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] we find names such as [[Benito Pérez Galdós]], [[Emilia Pardo Bazán]], [[Leopoldo Alas]] (Clarín), [[Concepción Arenal]], [[Vicente Blasco Ibáñez]] and [[Menéndez Pelayo]]. Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'. In the spirit of general "Realism", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations.

The group that has become known as the [[Generation of 1898]] was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain. The "Disaster" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of ''Regeneracionismo''. For a group of younger writers, among them [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[Pío Baroja]], and [[José Martínez Ruiz]] (Azorín), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with [[Ramón del Valle-Inclán]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98.

The Generation of 1914 or ''Novecentismo''. The next supposed "generation" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914—the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, [[José Ortega y Gasset]]—a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.

Leading voices include the poet [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], the academics and essayists [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]], [[Gregorio Marañón]], [[Manuel Azaña]], [[Maria Zambrano]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Clara Campoamor]] and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Miró, [[Ramón Pérez de Ayala]], and [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]]. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. [[Salvador de Madariaga]], another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the [[College of Europe]] and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the [[Liberal International]].

The Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, [[Jorge Guillén]], [[Federico García Lorca]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]], [[Dámaso Alonso]]. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of ''regeneracionistas'' and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.

The two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureate [[Camilo José Cela]] and [[Miguel Delibes]] from [[Generation of '36]]. Spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and with Latin American laureates they made the Spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all. The Spanish writers are: [[José Echegaray]], [[Jacinto Benavente]], [[Juan Ramón Jiménez]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]] and [[Camilo José Cela]]. The Portuguese writer [[José Saramago]], also awarded with the prize, lived for many years in Spain and spoke both Portuguese and Spanish. Saramago was also well known by his [[Iberism|Iberist]] ideas.

The [[Generation of '50]] are also known as the children of the civil war. [[Rosa Chacel]], [[Gloria Fuertes]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[Carmen Martín Gaite]], [[Ana María Matute]], [[Juan Marsé]], [[Blas de Otero]], [[Gabriel Celaya]], [[Antonio Gamoneda]], [[Rafael Sánchez Ferlosio]] or [[Ignacio Aldecoa]].

[[Premio Planeta de Novela]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] are the two main awards nowadays in Spanish literature.

[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain arrived later and less strong as in other European countries, but during the [[XIX century]] liberal ideas arrived into Spanish society. At the end of the century, socialist and libertarian ideas also flourished particularly strong at the intellectual level, with thinkers as [[Francisco Pi i Margall]], [[Ricardo Mella]] or [[Francisco Ferrer Guardia]].

In the first half of the 20th century the most prominent philosophers are [[Maria Zambrano]] and [[José Ortega y Gasset]].

Artists from Spain have been highly influential in the development of various European and [[Hispanic America|American]] [[art movement|artistic movements]]. Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish and influences in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]] is still evident today. European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the [[Renaissance]] [[Baroque|Spanish Baroque]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] periods. There are many other autochthonous styles such as the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]], [[Herrerian]] architecture or the [[Isabelline Gothic]].

During the [[Golden Age]] we find painters such as [[El Greco]], [[José de Ribera]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] and [[Francisco Zurbarán]]. Also inside Baroque period [[Diego Velázquez]] created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, like ''[[Las Meninas]]'' or ''[[Las Hilanderas (Velázquez)|Las Hilanderas]]''.

[[Francisco Goya]] painted during a historical period that includes the [[Peninsular War|Spanish Independence War]], the fights between liberals and absolutists, and the raise of contemporary state-nations.

[[Joaquín Sorolla]] is a well-known impressionist painter and there are many important Spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Joan Miró]].

=== Sculpture ===
[[File:Chillida-peine.jpg|thumb|''The Comb of the Wind'' of [[Eduardo Chillida]] in [[San Sebastián]]]]

The Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time. [[Alonso Berruguete]] ([[Valladolid]] School) is called the "Prince of Spanish sculpture". His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were [[Bartolomé Ordóñez]], [[Diego de Siloé]], [[Juan de Juni]] and [[Damià Forment|Damián Forment]].

There were two Schools of special flair and talent: the [[Sevillian school of sculpture|Seville School]], to which [[Juan Martínez Montañés]] belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granada School]], to which [[Alonso Cano]] belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.

Other notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were [[Pedro de Mena]], [[Pedro Roldán]] and his daughter [[Luisa Roldán]], [[Juan de Mesa]] and [[Pedro Duque Cornejo]]. In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio González]], [[Pablo Gargallo]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], and [[Pablo Serrano]].

[[Mario Camus]] and [[Pilar Miró]] worked together in [[Curro Jiménez]].

Spanish cinema has also seen international success over the years with films by directors like [[Segundo de Chomón]], [[Florián Rey]], [[Luis García Berlanga]], [[Carlos Saura]], [[Julio Medem]], [[Isabel Coixet]], [[Alejandro Amenábar]], [[Icíar Bollaín]] and brothers [[David Trueba]] and [[Fernando Trueba]].

Actresses [[Sara Montiel]] and [[Penélope Cruz]] or actor [[Antonio Banderas]] are among those who have become [[Cinema in the United States|Hollywood]] stars.

Due to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences. An important provincial city founded by the Romans and with an extensive [[Roman era]] infrastructure, [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] became the cultural capital, including fine Arabic style architecture, during the time of the Islamic [[Umayyad dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Jo|last=Cruz|title=Western Views of Islam in Medieval and Early Modern Europe: Perception and Other|editor=Edited by David R. Blanks and Michael Frassetto|location=New York|publisher=Saint Martin's Press|year=1999|page=56}}</ref> Later Arab style architecture continued to be developed under successive Islamic dynasties, ending with the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid]], which built its famed palace complex in [[Granada]].

Simultaneously, the Christian kingdoms gradually emerged and developed their own styles; developing a [[pre-Romanesque]] style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] streams. There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The [[Mudéjar]] style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was developed by introducing Arab style motifs, patterns and elements into European architecture.

The arrival of [[Modernism]] in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in [[Barcelona]], known as [[modernisme]], produced a number of important architects, of which [[Gaudí]] is one. The [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] was led by groups like [[GATEPAC]]. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in [[contemporary architecture]] and [[:Category:Spanish architects|Spanish architects]] like [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Ricardo Bofill]] as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.

Spanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with [[flamenco]], a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of [[folk music]] abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.

In the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as [[Isaac Albéniz]], [[Manuel de Falla]] and [[Enrique Granados]] and singers and performers such as [[Plácido Domingo]], [[José Carreras]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Alicia de Larrocha]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Ricardo Viñes]], [[José Iturbi]], [[Pablo de Sarasate]], [[Jordi Savall]] and [[Teresa Berganza]]. In Spain there are over forty professional orchestras, including the [[Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra|Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona]], [[Orquesta Nacional de España]] and the [[Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid]]. Major [[opera houses]] include the [[Teatro Real]], the [[Gran Teatre del Liceu]], [[Teatro Arriaga]] and the [[El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía]].

Spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate. It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep [[Mediterranean]] roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:

'''''Mediterranean''''' Spain – all such coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia – heavy use of seafood, such as ''pescaíto frito'' (fried fish); several cold soups like ''[[gazpacho]]''; and many rice-based dishes like ''[[paella]]'' from Valencia<ref name="paella" /> and ''[[arròs negre]]'' (black rice) from Catalonia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |title=Spain Gain at Mercat Negre |work=The Village Voice |date=1 December 2009 |last=DiGregorio |first=Sarah |location=New York |accessdate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208050334/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |archivedate=8 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

'''''Inner''''' Spain – Castile – hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based ''Castilian soup'', along with substantious stews such as ''[[cocido madrileño]]''. Food is traditionally conserved by salting, like [[Spanish ham]], or immersed in [[olive oil]], like [[Manchego cheese]].

'''''Atlantic''''' Spain – the whole Northern coast, including [[Asturian cuisine|Asturian]], [[Basque cuisine|Basque]], [[Cantabrian cuisine|Cantabrian]] and [[Galician cuisine]] – vegetable and fish-based stews like ''[[caldo gallego]]'' and ''[[marmitako]]''. Also, the lightly cured ''[[Lacón Gallego|lacón]]'' ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, like the Basque-style [[cod]], [[albacore]] or [[anchovy]] or the Galician octopus-based ''[[polbo á feira]]'' and shellfish dishes.

=== Sport ===

While varieties of football had been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. [[Real Madrid C.F.]] and [[FC Barcelona]] are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. [[Spain national football team|The country's national football team]] won the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], and is the first team to ever win three back-to-back major international tournaments.

[[Basketball]], [[tennis]], cycling, [[team handball|handball]], [[Spain national futsal team|futsal]], [[motorcycling]] and, lately, [[Formula One]] are also important due to the presence of Spanish champions in all these disciplines. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] that were hosted in [[Barcelona]], which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for [[water sports]], [[golf]] and [[skiing]].

The most outstanding athletes figure: [[Rafael Nadal]] is the leading Spanish tennis player and has won seventeen [[List of Grand Slam men's singles champions|Grand Slam titles]] (second most of any man)<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.tennis-x.com/grand-slam-finals/rafael-nadal.php|title=Rafael Nadal's Grand Slam Titles, Finals, Records|website=tennis-x.com}}</ref> and holds the record with the [[Tennis Masters Series records and statistics#Total titles and finals|most number]] of [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] singles titles.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/nadal-nishikori-monte-carlo-2018-sunday|title=Nadal Clinches La Undécima – World No. 1 wins historic 11th title in the Principality|author=atpworldtour.com|date=22 April 2018}}</ref> [[Marc Márquez]] is the leading Spanish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and is a five-time [[List of 500cc/MotoGP Motorcycle World Champions|MotoGP world champion]].<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/motogp-marc-marquez-youngest-four-time-world-champion-valencia-grand-prix-results-highlights-andrea-a8050891.html|title=Marc Marquez the youngest four-time MotoGP champion after winning title in dramatic Valencia Grand Prix finish|author=Jack de Menezes|date=12 November 2017|work=The Independent}}</ref> [[Carolina Marín]] is the leading Spanish [[badminton]] player being one-time Olympic Champion,<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36690971|title=Rio Olympics 2016: Carolina Marin beats India's PV Sindhu in badminton final|date= 19 August 2016|author=BBC}}</ref> three-time World Champion<ref>[http://www.badmintoneurope.com/cms/default.aspx?clubid=4685&m=6425435&cmsid=239&pageid=5381& "BREAKING: Marin World Champion"] badmintoneurope.com 6 August 2018</ref> and four-time European Champion.<ref>{{cite|url=https://articles.olympicchannel.com/ole-historic-four-in-a-row-for-carolina-marin-in-hometown-huelva/|title=Olé!

Public holidays celebrated in Spain include a mix of religious ([[Roman Catholic]]), national and regional observances. Each municipality is allowed to declare a maximum of 14 public holidays per year; up to nine of these are chosen by the national government and at least two are chosen locally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bank-holidays.com/holidays_2007_58.htm|title=Bank holidays in Spain|publisher=bank-holidays.com|accessdate=13 August 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918001803/http://www.bank-holidays.com/holidays_2007_58.htm|archivedate=18 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Spain's National Day (''[[Fiesta Nacional de España]]'') is 12 October, the anniversary of the [[Exploration of North America|Discovery of America]] and commemorate [[Our Lady of the Pillar]] feast, patroness of [[Aragon]] and throughout Spain.

There are many festivals and festivities in Spain. Some of them are known worldwide, and every year millions of people from all over the world go to Spain to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous is [[San Fermín]], in [[Pamplona]]. While its most famous event is the ''encierro'', or the [[running of the bulls]], which happens at 8:00&nbsp;am from 7 to 14 July, the week-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events. Its events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by [[Ernest Hemingway]], which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. As a result, it has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.

Other festivals include: [[La Tomatina]] tomato festival in [[Buñol]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the carnivals in the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Falles]] in [[Valencia]] or the [[Holy Week]] in Andalusia and [[Castile and León]].

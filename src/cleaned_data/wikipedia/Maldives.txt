The '''Maldives''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɔː|l|d|iː|v|z}}, {{IPAc-en|US|audio=en-us-Maldives.ogg|ˈ|m|ɔː|l|d|aɪ|v|z}}; {{lang-dv|ދިވެހިރާއްޖެ}} ''Dhivehi Raajje''), officially the '''Republic of Maldives''', is an Asian country, located in the [[Indian Ocean]], situated in the [[Arabian Sea]]. It lies southwest of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[India]], about {{convert|1000|km|mi}} from the [[Asian continent]]. The chain of [[Atolls of the Maldives|26 atolls]] stretches from [[Atolls of the Maldives|Ihavandhippolhu Atoll]] in the north to the [[Addu City]] in the south. Comprising a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] spanning roughly {{convert|298|km2}}, the Maldives is one of the world's most geographically dispersed [[sovereign state]]s as well as the [[List of sovereign states and dependent territories in Asia|smallest Asian country]] by land area and population, with around {{UN_Population|Maldives}} inhabitants. [[Malé]] is the capital and a populated city, traditionally called the "[[List of sultans of the Maldives|King's Island]]" for its central location.

The Maldives archipelago is located on the [[Chagos-Laccadive Ridge]], a vast submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean, which also forms a [[terrestrial ecoregion]], together with the [[Chagos Archipelago]] and [[Lakshadweep]].<ref>{{NatGeo ecoregion |id=im0125 |name=Maldives-Lakshadweep-Chagos Archipelago tropical moist forests |accessdate=30 December 2010}}</ref> With an average ground-level elevation of {{convert|1.5|m}} above sea level,<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/11/climatechange-endangered-habitats-maldives |work=[[The Guardian]] |location= London |title= The last days of paradise |first=Jon |last=Henley |date=11 November 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2010 | quote= [The Maldives] holds the record for the country with the lowest high point on earth: nowhere on any of the islands on Maldives does the natural ground level exceed 5.1m.

[[Islam]] was introduced to the Maldivian archipelago in the 12th century which was consolidated as a [[list of Sultans of the Maldives|sultanate]], developing strong commercial and cultural ties with [[Asia]] and [[Africa]]. From the mid-16th-century, the region came under the increasing influence of European [[colonialism|colonial powers]], with the Maldives becoming a British [[protectorate]] in 1887. [[Second Republic of the Maldives|Independence]] from the United Kingdom was achieved in 1965 and a [[presidential republic]] was established in 1968 with an elected [[People's Majlis]]. The ensuing decades have been characterised by political instability, efforts at democratic reform,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/maldives |title=Maldives – Country report – Freedom in the World – 2015 |publisher= |date=2015-01-21 }}</ref> and environmental challenges posed by [[climate change]].<ref>https://unfccc.int/resource/docs/napa/mdv01.pdf</ref>

The Maldives is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC). It is also a member of the United Nations, the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]], and the [[Non Aligned Movement]]. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an upper [[middle income]] economy.<ref>[http://data.worldbank.org/income-level/UMC Upper middle income] [[World Bank]]. Retrieved 18 September 2015.</ref> [[Fishing in the Maldives|Fishing]] has historically been the dominant economic activity, and remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing [[tourism in the Maldives|tourism]] industry.

The word ''{{lang|oty|theevu}}'' (archaic ''{{lang|oty|heevu}}'', related to Tamil {{lang|ta|தீவு}}, ''{{lang|ta-Latn|dheevu}}'') means "island", and ''Dhives'' (''Dhivehin'') means "islanders" (i.e., Maldivians).{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The ancient Sri Lankan chronicle ''[[Mahawamsa]]'' refers to an island called ''{{lang|pi-Latn|Mahiladiva}}'' ("Island of Women", {{lang|pi|महिलादिभ}}) in [[Pali]], which is probably a mistranslation of the same [[Sanskrit]] word meaning "[[garland]]".

Jan S Hogendorn, Grossman Professor of Economics, theorises that the name Maldives derives from the Sanskrit ''{{lang|sa-Latn|mālādvīpa}}'' ({{lang|sa|मालाद्वीप}}), meaning "garland of islands".<ref name="Hogendorn">Hogendorn, Jan and Johnson Marion (1986).

==History==
{{main|History of the Maldives}}

===Ancient history and settlement===
{{main|History of the Maldives#Early Age}}

The first Maldivians did not leave any archaeological artifacts. Their buildings were probably built of wood, palm fronds and other perishable materials, which would have quickly decayed in the salt and wind of the tropical climate. Moreover, chiefs or headmen did not reside in elaborate stone palaces, nor did their religion require the construction of large temples or compounds.<ref>Kalpana Ram (1993). ''Mukkuvar Women''. Macquarie University.</ref>

Comparative studies of Maldivian oral, linguistic and cultural traditions and customs confirm that the first settlers were people from the southern shores of the neighboring [[Indian subcontinent]],<ref name="autogenerated2">Xavier Romero-Frias, ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom''</ref> including the [[Giraavaru people]] mentioned in ancient legends and local folklore about the establishment of the capital and kingly rule in [[Malé]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zSjhruMm748C&pg=PA36&dq=Giraavaru+people#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Maldives|last=Ellis|first=Royston|year=2008|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|isbn=9781841622668}}</ref>

A strong underlying layer of [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] population and culture survives in Maldivian society, with a clear [[Tamil–Kannada languages|Tamil-Malayalam]] substratum in the language, which also appears in place names, kinship terms, poetry, dance, and religious beliefs. [[Malabar region|Malabari]] seafaring culture led to the settlement of the Islands by [[Malayali]] seafarers.<ref name="Maloney, Clarence">{{cite web|title=Maldives People |author=Maloney, Clarence |url=http://www.iias.nl/iiasn/iiasn5/insouasi/maloney.html|work=International Institute for Asian Studies |accessdate=22 June 2008}}</ref>

The earliest written history of the Maldives was marked by the arrival of [[Sinhala people|Sinhalese]] people in Sri Lanka and the Maldives (''Mahiladvipika'') circa 543 to 483 BC, as reported in the ''[[Mahavansa]]''. Their settlement marks a significant change in demographics and the development of the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan language]] [[Dhivehi language]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Buddhist period===
{{main|History of the Maldives#Buddhist period|Buddhism in the Maldives}}
[[File:Loamaafaanu.jpg|thumb|[[Isdhoo (Laamu Atoll)|Isdhoo]] Lōmāfānu is the oldest [[Lōmāfānu|copper-plate]] book to have been discovered in the Maldives to date. The book was written in AD 1194 (590 AH) in the Evēla form of the [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|Divehi akuru]], during the reign of [[Dhinei of the Maldives|Siri Fennaadheettha Mahaa Radun (Dhinei Kalaminja)]].]]

Despite being just mentioned briefly in most history books, the 1,400-year-long Buddhist period has foundational importance in the history of the Maldives. It was during this period that the culture of the Maldives both developed and flourished, a culture which survives today. The Maldivian [[Dhivehi language|language]], the first Maldive [[Dhivehi Writing Systems|scripts]], the architecture, the ruling institutions, the customs and manners of the Maldivians originated at the time when the Maldives were a Buddhist kingdom.<ref>Clarence Maloney. ''People of the Maldive Islands.'' Orient Longman</ref>

Buddhism probably spread to the Maldives in the 3rd century BC at the time of Emperor [[Ashoka]]'s expansion and became the dominant religion of the people of the Maldives until the 12th century AD. The ancient Maldivian Kings promoted [[Buddhism]], and the first Maldive writings and artistic achievements, in the form of highly developed sculpture and architecture, are from that period. Nearly all archaeological remains in the Maldives are from Buddhist [[stupa]]s and monasteries, and all artifacts found to date display characteristic Buddhist iconography.
Buddhist (and Hindu) temples were [[Mandala]] shaped, they are oriented according to the four cardinal points, the main gate being towards the east.
Local historian Hassan Ahmed Maniku counted as many as 59 islands with Buddhist archaeological sites in a provisional list he published in 1990.

===Islamic period===
{{See also|History of the Maldives#Islamic Period|Islam in Maldives|List of sultans of the Maldives}}
[[File:Yousuftabrizi.jpg|thumb|left|A plaque in Juma Mosque, Malé, Maldives, on which Tabrezi's name is written. Tabrezi was a Persian who is said to have converted Maldives in 12th century AD to [[Islam]].]]

The importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives [[Dhovemi of the Maldives|Dhovemi]] converted to [[Islam]] in the year 1153 (or 1193), adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al Adil, and initiating a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, ''Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives'' which came with the style ''[[Highness]]''.

The person traditionally deemed responsible for this conversion in 1153, was a [[Somalis|Somali]] Muslim visitor named Abu'l Barakat al-Barbari also known as [[Aw Barkhadle]], according to the story told to [[Ibn Battutah]], who goes on to say a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu'l Barakat al-Barbari.'<ref>{{cite book|last1=Battutah|first1=Ibn|title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah|date=2002|publisher=Picador|location=London|isbn=9780330418799|pages=235–236, 320}}</ref><ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZF2spo9BKacC The Adventures of Ibn Battuta: A Muslim Traveller of the Fourteenth Century]''</ref>

Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the East African origins account that was known as well at the time.<ref>{{Citation|last=Honchell|first=Stephanie|title=Sufis, Sea Monsters, and Miraculous Circumcisions: Comparative Conversion Narratives and Popular Memories of Islamization|volume=|page=5|year=2018|contribution=|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University and the University of Cape Town|quote=In reference to Ibn Batuta's Moroccan theory of this figure, citation 8 of this text mentions, that other accounts identify Yusuf Al Barbari as East African or Persian. But as fellow Maghribi, Ibn Battuta likely felt partial to the Moroccan version.}}</ref> Even when Ibn Battuta visited the islands the governor of the island at that time was [[Abd al-Aziz of Mogadishu|Abd Aziz Al Mogadishawi]], a [[Somalis|Somali]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1av8DsKezysC&pg=PA58&dq=it+came+into+my+heart+to+go+back+to+maldive#v=onepage&q=it%20came%20into%20my%20heart%20to%20go%20back%20to%20maldive&f=false|title=Ibn Battuta in the Maldives and Ceylon|last=Defremery|first=C.|year=1999|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=9788120612198}}</ref>

His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of [[Hukuru Mosque]], or miski, in the capital of [[Malé]]. Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of [[Jahiliya]] (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the [[#Introduction of Islam|introduction of Islam]] at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.

Compared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the [[Malabar Coast]] since the 7th century, and [[Muhammad bin Qasim|Muhammad Bin Qāsim]] had converted large swathes of [[Sindh]] to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of [[Malabar Coast]] and Sindh—perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the [[Maliki]] school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.

Middle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from [[Basra]] sailing to  Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly [[cowrie shells]]—widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the [[East Africa]]n coast—and coir fiber. The [[Bengal Sultanate]], where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal–Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TXphAAAAQBAJ|title=Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History|first=P.|last=Boomgaard|date=1 January 2008|publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9789004253995}}</ref>
The other essential product of the Maldives was [[coir]], the fibre of the dried [[coconut]] [[husk]], resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the [[dhow]]s that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, [[China]], [[Yemen]], and the [[Persian Gulf]].

===Colonial period===
[[File:18th-century Maldives map by Pierre Mortier.jpg|thumb|18th-century map by Pierre Mortier of The [[Netherlands]] depicting with detail the islands of the Maldives]]

In 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a ''Viador'' (''Viyazoru''), or overseer of a [[factory (trading post)]] in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in [[Goa]]. Their attempts to impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al-Azam]] and his two brothers, that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National Day.
In the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in [[Ceylon]], established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.

The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a [[Protected state|British protected area]]. The status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule, which continued to be regulated by [[Muslim]] traditional institutions in exchange for an [[Maldivian annual tribute|annual tribute]]. The status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including [[Zanzibar]] and the [[Trucial States]].

In the British period,the Sultan's powers were taken over by the Chief Minister, much to the chagrin of the British Governor-General who continued to deal with the ineffectual Sultan. Consequently, Britain encouraged the development of a [[constitutional monarchy]], and the first Constitution was proclaimed in 1932. However, the new arrangements favoured neither the aging Sultan nor the wily Chief Minister, but rather a young crop of British-educated reformists. As a result, angry mobs were instigated against the Constitution which was publicly torn up.

Maldives remained a British crown protectorate until 1953 when the sultanate was suspended and the First Republic was declared under the short-lived presidency of [[Muhammad Amin Didi]]. While serving as prime minister during the 1940s, Didi nationalized the fish export industry. As president, he is remembered as a reformer of the education system and a promoter of [[women's rights]]. Conservatives in Malé eventually ousted his government, and during a riot over food shortages, Didi was beaten by a mob and died on a nearby island.

Beginning in the 1950s, the political history in Maldives was largely influenced by the British military presence in the islands. In 1954 the restoration of the sultanate perpetuated the rule of the past. Two years later, the United Kingdom obtained permission to reestablish its wartime [[RAF Gan]] airfield in the southernmost [[Addu Atoll]], employing hundreds of locals. In 1957, however, the new prime minister, [[Ibrahim Nasir]], called for a review of the agreement. Nasir was challenged in 1959 by a local secessionist movement in the three southernmost atolls that benefited economically from the British presence on [[Gan (Seenu Atoll)|Gan]]. This group cut ties with the Maldives government and formed an independent state, the [[United Suvadive Republic]] with [[Abdullah Afif]] as president and [[Hithadhoo (Seenu Atoll)|Hithadhoo]] as capital. One year later the Suvadive republic was scrapped after Nasir sent gunboats from Malé with government police, and Abdulla Afif went into exile. Meanwhile, in 1960 the Maldives had allowed the United Kingdom to continue to use both the [[RAF Gan|Gan]] and the Hitaddu facilities for a thirty-year period, with the payment of £750,000 over the period of 1960 to 1965 for the purpose of Maldives' economic development. The base was closed in 1976 as part of the larger British withdrawal of permanently stationed forces '[[East of Suez]]'.<ref name="gan.philliptsmall.me.uk">{{cite web|url=http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |title=The Sun never sets on the British Empire |publisher=Gan.philliptsmall.me.uk |date=17 May 1971 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919212227/http://gan.philliptsmall.me.uk/00%20-%20Articles/PeterGeary%20%5BBritish%20Empire%5D.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 }}</ref>

===Independence and republic===
In line with the broader British policy of decolonisation on 26 July 1965 an agreement was signed on behalf of His Majesty the Sultan by Ibrahim Nasir Rannabandeyri Kilegefan, prime minister, and on behalf of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty The Queen]] by Sir Michael Walker, British Ambassador designate to the Maldive Islands, which ended the British responsibility for the defence and external affairs of the Maldives. The islands thus achieved full political independence, with the ceremony taking place at the British High Commissioner's Residence in Colombo. After this, the sultanate continued for another three years under [[Muhammad Fareed Didi]], who declared himself King rather than Sultan.

On 15 November 1967, a vote was taken in parliament to decide whether the Maldives should continue as a [[constitutional monarchy]] or become a republic. Of the 44 members of parliament, forty voted in favour of a republic. On 15 March 1968, a national referendum was held on the question, and 93.34% of those taking part voted in favour of establishing a republic. The republic was declared on 11 November 1968, thus ending the 853-year-old monarchy, which was replaced by a republic under the presidency of [[Ibrahim Nasir]]. As the King had held little real power, this was seen as a cosmetic change and required few alterations in the structures of government.

[[File:Maumoon-Abdul-Gayoom.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mamoon Abdul Gayoom]], [[President of the Maldives]] (1978–2008)]]

[[Tourism in the Maldives|Tourism]] began to be developed on the [[archipelago]] by the beginning of the 1970s. The first resort in the Maldives was [[Kurumba Maldives]] which welcomed the first guests on 3 October 1972. The first accurate census was held in December 1977 and showed 142,832 persons residing in Maldives.<ref>"[http://countrystudies.us/maldives/4.htm Maldives – Population". Library of Congress Country Studies]</ref>
Political infighting during the '70s between Nasir's faction and other political figures led to the 1975 arrest and exile of elected prime minister [[Ahmed Zaki (politician)|Ahmed Zaki]] to a remote [[atoll]]. Economic decline followed the closure of the [[Gan International Airport|British airfield at Gan]] and the collapse of the market for dried fish, an important export. With support for his administration faltering, Nasir fled to Singapore in 1978, with millions of dollars from the treasury.

[[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] began his 30-year role as president in 1978, winning six consecutive elections without opposition. His election was seen as ushering in a period of political stability and economic development in view of Gayoom's priority to develop the poorer islands. Tourism flourished and increased foreign contact spurred development. However, Gayoom's rule was controversial, with some critics saying Gayoom was an autocrat who quelled dissent by limiting freedoms and political favouritism.<ref name="cnn_sinking">{{cite news |title=Sinking island nation seeks new home |author=CNN|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/11/maldives.president/index.html |accessdate=12 November 2008|date=11 November 2008}}BAT</ref>

A series of coup attempts (in 1980, 1983, and 1988) by Nasir supporters and business interests tried to topple the government without success. While the first two attempts met with little success, the 1988 coup attempt involved a roughly 80-person mercenary force of the [[People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam|PLOTE]] who seized the airport and caused Gayoom to flee from house to house until the intervention of 1600 [[Indian Armed Forces|Indian troops]] airlifted into [[Malé]] restored order.

A November 1988 coup was headed by Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee, a small-businessman. On the night of 3 November 1988, the [[Indian Air Force]] airlifted a parachute battalion group from [[Agra]] and flew them over {{convert|2000|km|mi}} to the Maldives. The Indian [[paratroopers]] landed at [[Hulule]] and secured the airfield and restored the government rule at Malé within hours. The brief operation, labelled ''[[Operation Cactus]]'', also involved the [[Indian Navy]].

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of the Maldives}}

[[File:Malosmadulu Atolls, Maldives.jpg|thumb|upright|Malhosmadulhu Atoll seen from space. "Fasdutere" and [[Southern Maalhosmadulhu Atoll]] can be seen in this picture.]]

The Maldives consists of 1,192 [[coral island]]s grouped in a double chain of 26 [[atoll]]s, along the north-south direction, spread over roughly {{convert|90000|km²}}, making this one of the world's most dispersed countries. It lies between latitudes [[1st parallel south|1°S]] and [[8th parallel north|8°N]], and longitudes [[72nd meridian east|72°]] and [[74th meridian east|74°E]]. The atolls are composed of live [[coral reef]]s and [[sand bar]]s, situated atop a submarine ridge {{convert|960|km}} long that rises abruptly from the depths of the Indian Ocean and runs north to south.

Only near the southern end of this natural coral barricade do two open passages permit safe ship navigation from one side of the Indian Ocean to the other through the territorial waters of Maldives. For administrative purposes, the Maldivian government organised these atolls into 21 [[Administrative divisions of the Maldives|administrative divisions]]. The largest island of Maldives is [[Gan (Laamu Atoll)|Gan]], which belongs to Laamu Atoll or Hahdhummathi Maldives. In [[Addu Atoll]], the westernmost islands are connected by roads over the reef (collectively called Link Road) and the total length of the road is {{convert|14|km|0|abbr=on}}.

Maldives is the lowest country in the world, with maximum and average natural ground levels of only {{convert|2.4|m}} and {{convert|1.5|m}} above sea level, respectively. In areas where construction exists, however, this has been increased to several metres. More than 80 per cent of the country's land is composed of coral islands which rise less than one metre above sea level.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2010/06/201062915490741700.html |title=Entire Maldives cabinet resigns |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=29 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref> As a result, the Maldives are at high risk of being submerged due to [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]].

===Climate===
[[File:Bathala (Maldives) 8.JPG|thumb|left|A beach of [[Bathala (island)|Bathala]] island]]

The Maldives has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (Am) under the [[Köppen climate classification]], which is affected by the large landmass of South Asia to the north. Because the Maldives has the lowest elevation of any country in the world, the temperature is constantly hot and often humid. The presence of this landmass causes differential heating of land and water. These factors set off a rush of moisture-rich air from the Indian Ocean over South Asia, resulting in the southwest [[monsoon]]. Two seasons dominate Maldives' weather: the dry season associated with the winter northeastern monsoon and the rainy season which brings strong winds and storms.

The shift from the dry northeast monsoon to the moist southwest monsoon occurs during April and May. During this period, the southwest winds contribute to the formation of the southwest monsoon, which reaches Maldives in the beginning of June and lasts until the end of August. However, the weather patterns of Maldives do not always conform to the monsoon patterns of South Asia. The annual rainfall averages {{convert|254|cm}} in the north and {{convert|381|cm}} in the south.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maldives – Atlapedia Online|url=http://www.atlapedia.com/online/countries/maldives.htm}}</ref>

The monsoonal influence is greater in the north of the Maldives than in the south, more influenced by the [[Equatorial Counter Current|equatorial currents]].

{{see also|The Island President}}
The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]'s 2007 report predicted the upper limit of the [[sea level rise]]s will be {{convert|59|cm}} by 2100, which means that most of the republic's 200 inhabited islands may need to be abandoned.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/editorial/where-climate-change-threatens-survival-20120108-1pq4c.html |accessdate=18 September 2015 |title=Where climate change threatens survival |date=9 January 2012 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref> According to researchers from the [[University of Southampton]], the Maldives are the third most endangered nation due to flooding from [[climate change]] as a percentage of population.<ref>{{cite news | first = Marcus | last = Stephen | url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/A+sinking+feeling%3A+why+is+the+president+of+the+tiny+Pacific+island...-a0273079165 | title = A sinking feeling: Why is the president of the tiny Pacific island nation of Nauru so concerned about climate change?| work = [[The New York Times Upfront]] |accessdate = 9 February 2015 | authorlink = Marcus Stephen | date = 14 November 2011 | quote = Most Endangered Island nations at highest risk for flooding due to climate change 3 Maldives (Indian Ocean) }}</ref>

In 2008, President Mohamed Nasheed announced plans to look into purchasing new land in India, Sri Lanka, and Australia because of his concerns about global warming, and the possibility of much of the islands being inundated with water from rising sea levels. The purchase of land will be made from a fund generated by tourism. The President has explained his intentions: "We do not want to leave the Maldives, but we also do not want to be [[climate refugee]]s living in tents for decades".<ref name=Guardian>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/10/maldives-climate-change|work=The Guardian |location=London |title=Paradise almost lost: Maldives seek to buy a new homeland| first=Randeep| last= Ramesh| date=10 November 2008|accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref>

By 2020, Maldives plans to eliminate or offset all of its greenhouse gas emissions. At the 2009 International Climate Talks, President Mohamed Nasheed explained that: <blockquote>For us swearing off fossil fuels is not only the right thing to do, it is in our economic self-interest... Pioneering countries will free themselves from the unpredictable price of foreign oil; they will capitalise on the new green economy of the future, and they will enhance their moral standing giving them greater political influence on the world stage.<ref>{{cite news|title=Climate Change Gridlock: Where Do We Go From Here?

===Environment===
Environmental issues other than [[sea level rise]] include bad waste disposal and [[beach theft]]. Although the Maldives are kept relatively pristine and little [[litter]] can be found on the islands, no good [[Waste management|waste disposal]] sites exist.

The Maldives have a range of different habitats including deep sea, shallow coast, and reef ecosystems, fringing mangroves, wetlands and dry land. There are 187 species of coral forming the [[coral reefs]]. This area of the Indian Ocean, alone, houses 1100 [[species]] of fish, 5 species of [[sea turtle]], 21 species of whale and dolphin, 400 species of mollusc, and 83 species of echinoderms. The area is also populated by a number of crustacean species: 120 copepod, 15 amphipod, as well as more than 145 crab and 48 shrimp species.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/mv/mv-nr-04-en.pdf |title=Fourth National Report to the Convention on Biological Diversity of Maldives |publisher=Ministry of Housing and Environment |page=7 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104002542/https://www.cbd.int/doc/world/mv/mv-nr-04-en.pdf |archivedate=4 November 2015 }}</ref>

In 1998, sea-temperature warming of as much as {{convert|5|C-change}} due to a single [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño phenomenon]] event caused [[coral bleaching]], killing two-thirds of the nation's coral reefs.<ref name=Wheatley>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcoral.org/Maldives%20Nurses%20Its%20Coral%20Reefs%20Back%20to%20Life.htm |title=Maldives Nurses Its Coral Reefs Back to Life |publisher=Globalcoral.org |date=2 May 2004 |accessdate=2 April 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921010958/http://www.globalcoral.org/Maldives%20Nurses%20Its%20Coral%20Reefs%20Back%20to%20Life.htm |archivedate=21 September 2013 }}</ref>

In an effort to induce the regrowth of the reefs, scientists placed electrified cones anywhere from {{convert|20|–|60|ft}} below the surface to provide a substrate for larval coral attachment. In 2004, scientists witnessed corals regenerating. Corals began to eject pink-orange eggs and sperm. The growth of these electrified corals was five times faster than untreated corals.<ref name=Wheatley/> Scientist Azeez Hakim stated: <blockquote>before 1998, we never thought that this reef would die. We had always taken for granted that these animals would be there, that this reef would be there forever. El Niño gave us a wake-up call that these things are not going to be there for ever. Not only this, they also act as a natural barrier against the tropical storms, floods and tsunamis. Seaweeds grow on the skeletons of dead coral.<ref name=scuba /></blockquote>

Again, in 2016, the coral reefs of the Maldives experienced a [[Coral bleaching#Maldives|severe bleaching incident]]. Up to 95% of coral around some islands have died, and, even after six months, 100% of young coral transplants died. The surface water temperatures reached an all-time high in 2016, at 31 degrees Celsius in May.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coral Bleaching Updates|url=http://marinesavers.com/2016/07/coral-bleaching-updates/|website=MarineSavers|publisher=Marine Savers and Four Seasons Resorts Maldives (2012–2017)|accessdate=12 February 2017|date=2016-07-31}}</ref>

Recent scientific studies suggest that the faunistic composition can vary greatly between neighbour atolls, especially in terms of benthic fauna. Differences in terms of fishing pressure (including poaching) could be the cause.<ref name="Ducarme between">{{cite journal |first=Frédéric |last=Ducarme |date=2016 |title=Field Observations of Sea Cucumbers in Ari Atoll, and Comparison with Two Nearby Atolls in Maldives |url=http://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/InfoBull/BDM/36/BDM36_09_Ducarme.pdf |journal=SPC Beche-de-mer Information Bulletin |volume=36 }}</ref>

==Government==
{{main|Politics of the Maldives}}
[[File:JumhooreeMaidan.JPG|thumb|Independence Square in Malé]]

Maldives is a [[presidential system|presidential]] republic, with extensive influence of the president as [[head of government]] and [[head of state]]. The president heads the executive branch, acts at the same time as minister of defence and appoints the cabinet which is approved by the [[Majlis of the Maldives|People's Majlis (Parliament)]]. He leads police, army, coast guards, fire brigade and judiciary. There is no separation of powers. The current president as of 17 November 2018 is [[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]]. Members of the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Majlis serve five-year terms, with the total number of members determined by atoll populations. At the [[Maldivian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 election]], 77 members were elected. The People's Majlis, located in Male, houses members from all over the country.<ref name=r1>{{cite web|url=http://www.maldives-ethnography.com/ |title=Maldives Enthnography |publisher=Maldives-ethnography.com |accessdate=30 June 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116051343/http://www.maldives-ethnography.com/ |archivedate=16 January 2013 }}</ref>

The republican constitution came into force in 1968, and was amended in 1970, 1972, and 1975. On 27 November 1997 it was replaced by another Constitution assented to by the President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom|Gayoom]]. This Constitution came into force on 1 January 1998. All stated that the [[President of the Maldives|president]] was the head of state, head of government and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Maldives National Defence Force|Armed Forces]] and the Police of the Maldives.

According to the [[Constitution of Maldives]], "the judges are independent, and subject only to the Constitution and the law.

===Foreign relations===

[[File:Maldivian Defence Minister Mohamed Nazim addressing an audience in Kochi.jpg|thumb|Former Maldivian Defence Minister [[Mohamed Nazim]] at an Indian naval base in [[Kochi]]]]

Since 1996, the Maldives has been the official progress monitor of the [[Indian Ocean Commission]]. In 2002, the Maldives began to express interest in the commission but {{As of|2008|lc=y}} had not applied for membership. Maldives' interest relates to its identity as a small island state, especially economic development and environmental preservation, and its desire for closer relations with France, a main actor in the IOC region.

The Maldives is a founding member of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] ([[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]]). The republic joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] in 1982, some 17 years after gaining independence from the United Kingdom. In October 2016, Maldives announced its withdrawal from the Commonwealth<ref>[http://thecommonwealth.org/media/news/secretary-general-statement-maldives-decision-leave-commonwealth Secretary-General statement on Maldives decision to leave the Commonwealth], 13 October 2016</ref> in protest at allegations of human rights abuse and failing democracy.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/13/maldives-quits-commonwealth-over-alleged-rights-abuses Maldives quits Commonwealth over alleged rights abuses], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 13 October 2016</ref> The Maldives enjoys close ties with Commonwealth members [[Seychelles]] and [[Mauritius]]. The Maldives and [[Comoros]] are also both members of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]].

[[Ibrahim Mohamed Solih]] and his Cabinet has decided that the Maldives will be returning to its status as a [[Commonwealth republic]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://presidency.gov.mv/presidentNews/news/10346 | title=The President's Office}}</ref>

===Military===
{{main|Maldives National Defence Force}}
[[File:Maldives-vaixells de bombers.jpg|thumb|left|Fire & Rescue Service boats]]

The Maldives National Defence Force is the combined security organisation responsible for defending the security and sovereignty of the Maldives, having the primary task of being responsible for attending to all internal and external security needs of the Maldives, including the protection of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and the maintenance of peace and security. The MNDF component branches are the Coast Guard, Marine Corps, Special Forces, Service Corps and the Corps of Engineers.

As a water-bound nation much of the security concerns lie at sea. Almost 99% of the country is covered by sea and the remaining 1% land is scattered over an area of {{convert|800|km|0|abbr=on}} × {{convert|120|km|0|abbr=on}}, with the largest island being not more than {{convert|8|km2|0|abbr=on}}. Therefore, the duties assigned to the MNDF of maintaining surveillance over Maldives' waters and providing protection against foreign intruders poaching in the EEZ and territorial waters, are immense tasks from both logistical and economic viewpoints.

The Coast Guard plays a vital role in carrying out these functions. To provide timely security its patrol boats are stationed at various MNDF Regional Headquarters. The Coast Guard is also assigned to respond to the maritime distress calls and to conduct search and rescue operations in a timely manner. Maritime pollution control exercises are conducted regularly on an annual basis for familiarisation and handling of such hazardous situations.

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Administrative divisions of the Maldives}}

[[File:Atolls of the maldives.png|thumb|Each administrative atoll is marked, along with the [[thaana]] letter used to identify the atoll. Natural atolls are labelled in light blue. [//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Atolls_of_the_maldives.png Full view of the map].]]
The Maldives has twenty-six natural [[Atolls of the Maldives|atolls]] and few island groups on isolated reefs, all of which have been divided into twenty-one administrative divisions (19 administrative atolls and cities of [[Malé]] and [[Addu City|Addu]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/umv.html |title=Maldives Atolls|publisher=Statoids.com|accessdate=30 June 2010}}</ref>

Each atoll is administered by an elected Atoll Council. The islands are administered by an elected Island Council.

Between 2008 and 2010 the Maldives had 7 provinces each consisting of the following administrative divisions (the capital Malé is its own administrative division):
# [[Mathi-Uthuru Province]]; consists of [[Haa Alif Atoll]], [[Haa Dhaalu Atoll]] and [[Shaviyani Atoll]].
# [[Uthuru Province]]; consists of [[Noonu Atoll]], [[Raa Atoll]], [[Baa Atoll]] and [[Lhaviyani Atoll]].
# [[Medhu-Uthuru Province]]; consists of [[Kaafu Atoll]], [[Alifu Alifu Atoll]], [[Alifu Dhaalu Atoll]] and [[Vaavu Atoll]].
# [[Medhu Province]]; consists of [[Meemu Atoll]], [[Faafu Atoll]] and [[Dhaalu Atoll]].
# [[Medhu-Dhekunu Province]]; consists of [[Thaa Atoll]] and [[Laamu Atoll]].
# [[Mathi-Dhekunu Province]]; consists of [[Gaafu Alifu Atoll]] and [[Gaafu Dhaalu Atoll]].
# [[Dhekunu Province]]; consists of [[Gnaviyani Atoll]] and [[Addu City]].

In addition to a name, every administrative division is identified by the Maldivian code letters, such as "[[Haa Alif]]" for [[Northern Thiladhunmathi Atoll|Thiladhunmati Uthuruburi]] (Thiladhunmathi North); and by a Latin code letter. The first corresponds to the geographical Maldivian name of the atoll; the second is a code adopted for convenience. As there are certain islands in different atolls that have the same name, for administrative purposes this code is quoted before the name of the island, for example: Baa Funadhoo, Kaafu Funadhoo, Gaafu-Alifu Funadhoo. Since most Atolls have very long geographical names it is also used whenever the long name is inconvenient, for example in the atoll website names.<ref name="autogenerated1">''Divehiraajjege Jōgrafīge Vanavaru''. Muhammadu Ibrahim Lutfee</ref>

The introduction of code-letter names has been a source of much puzzlement and misunderstandings, especially among foreigners. Many people have come to think that the code-letter of the administrative atoll is its new name and that it has replaced its geographical name. Under such circumstances it is hard to know which is the correct name to use.<ref name="autogenerated1" />

Historically Maldives provided enormous quantities of [[cowry]] shells, [[history of money|an international currency of the early ages]]. From the 2nd century AD the islands were known as the 'Money Isles' by the Arabs.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hJD94VZweCIC&pg=PA9 | title=Maldives | author=Lyon, James  | date=October 2003 | publisher=Lonely Planet Publications Pty Ltd | page=9 | isbn=978-1-74059-176-8}}</ref>  ''[[Monetaria moneta]]'' were used for centuries as a currency in Africa, and huge amounts of [[Maldive Islands|Maldivian]] cowries were introduced into Africa by western nations during the period of [[slave trade]].<ref>Hogendorn, Jan and Johnson Marion (1986). ''The Shell Money of the Slave Trade''. African Studies Series 49, [[Cambridge University Press]], [[Cambridge]] {{ISBN|0521541107}}.</ref> The cowry is now the symbol of the [[Maldives Monetary Authority]].

In the early 1970s, the Maldives was one of the world’s 20 poorest countries, with a population of 100,000. The economy at the time was largely dependent on fisheries and trading local goods such as [[coir]] rope, [[ambergris]] (Maavaharu), and [[coco de mer]] (Tavakkaashi) with neighboring countries and [[East Asian]] countries.

The Maldivian government began a largely successful [[economic reform]] programme in 1980s, initially by lifting import quotas and giving more opportunities to private sector. At the time [[tourism]] sector which would play a significant role in the nation's development was at its infant stage.

Agriculture and manufacturing continue to play a lesser role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic labour.

===Tourism===
{{main|Tourism in the Maldives|Diving in the Maldives|List of mosques in the Maldives}}
[[File:Filitheyo bar.jpg|thumb|left|Filitheyo island beach with tall palm trees and blue fresh lagoons]]

The Maldives remained largely unknown to tourists until the early 1970s. Only 185 islands are home to its 447,137 inhabitants. The other islands are used entirely for economic purposes, of which tourism and agriculture are the most dominant. Tourism accounts for 28% of the GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.

The development of tourism fostered the overall growth of the [[Economy of the Maldives|country's economy]]. It created direct and indirect employment and income generation opportunities in other related industries. The first tourist resorts were opened in 1972 with Bandos Island Resort and Kurumba Village (the current name is Kurumba Maldives),<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/travel-news/coup-what-coup-tourists-ignore-maldives-turmoil-20120213-1t0wi.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Coup?

According to the [[Ministry of Tourism (Maldives)|Ministry of Tourism]], the emergence of tourism in 1972 transformed the economy, moving rapidly from dependence on fisheries to tourism. In just three and a half decades, the industry became the main source of income. Tourism was also the country's biggest foreign currency earner and the single largest contributor to the GDP. {{As of|2008}}, 89 resorts in the Maldives offered over 17,000 beds and hosted over 600,000 tourists annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tourism.gov.mv/ |title=Ministry of Tourism. Retrieved 3 April 2009 |publisher=Tourism.gov.mv |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>

The number of resorts increased from 2 to 92 between 1972 and 2007. {{As of|2007}}, over 8,380,000 tourists had visited Maldives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tourism.gov.mv/pubs/35_years_of_tourism_final.pdf |title=35 years of tourism |accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref><br />

Visitors to the Maldives do not need to apply for a visa pre-arrival, regardless of their country of origin, provided they have a valid passport, proof of onward travel, and the money to be self-sufficient while in the country.<ref name=doi>{{cite web|title=Entry into Maldives|url=http://www.immigration.gov.mv/index.php/entry-to-maldives.html|publisher=Department of Immigration and Emigration, Republic of Maldives|accessdate=9 February 2012}}</ref>

Most visitors arrive at [[Malé International Airport]], on [[Hulhulé]] Island, adjacent to the capital Malé. The airport is served by flights to and from India, Sri Lanka, [[Doha]], [[Dubai]], Singapore, Istanbul, and major airports in South-East Asia, as well as charters from Europe. [[Gan International Airport|Gan Airport]], on the southern atoll of [[Addu City|Addu]], also serves an international flight to [[Milan]] several times a week. [[British Airways]] offers direct flights to the Maldives around 2–3 times per week.

The country currently has [[List of mosques in the Maldives|six heritage Maldivian coral mosques]], all of which are listed as [[UNESCO]] tentative sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5812|title=Coral Stone Mosques of Maldives - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}</ref>

===Fishing industry===
{{main|Fishing industry in the Maldives}}
{{refimprove section|date=October 2016}}
[[File:Doni aux Maldives cropped.jpg|thumb|A mechanised traditional inter-island dhoni stripped of its sails]]

For many centuries the Maldivian economy was entirely dependent on fishing and other [[ocean|marine]] products. Fishing remains the main occupation of the people and the government gives priority to the fisheries sector.

The [[mechanisation]] of the [[traditional fishing boat]] called ''[[dhoni]]'' in 1974 was a major milestone in the development of the fisheries industry. A fish canning plant was installed on [[Felivaru]] in 1977, as a joint venture with a Japanese firm. In 1979, a Fisheries Advisory Board was set up with the mandate of advising the government on policy guidelines for the overall development of the fisheries sector. Manpower development programmes began in the early 1980s, and fisheries education was incorporated into the school curriculum. [[Fish aggregating device]]s and navigational aids were located at various strategic points. Moreover, the opening up of the [[exclusive economic zone]] (EEZ) of the Maldives for fisheries has further enhanced the growth of the fisheries sector.

{{As of|2010}}, fisheries contributed over 15% of the country's GDP and engaged about 30% of the country's work force. Fisheries were also the second-largest foreign exchange earner after [[#Tourism|tourism]].

{{main|Demographics of the Maldives}}
The largest ethnic group are [[Dhivehis]], i.e. the Maldivians, native to the historic region of the Maldive Islands comprising today's Republic of Maldives and the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], India. They share the same culture and speak the [[Dhivehi language]]. They are principally an [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] people, having traces of Middle Eastern, South Asian, [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] and African genes in the population.

In the past there was also a small [[Tamils|Tamil]] population known as the [[Giraavaru people]]. This group have now been almost completely absorbed into the larger Maldivian society but were once native to the island of [[Giraavaru (Kaafu Atoll)]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} This island was evacuated in 1968 due to heavy erosion of the island.

Some social stratification exists on the islands. It is not rigid, since rank is based on varied factors, including occupation, wealth, Islamic virtue, and family ties. Instead of a complex [[caste]] system, there was merely a distinction between noble (bēfulhu) and common people in the Maldives. Members of the social elite are concentrated in Malé.

The population doubled by 1978, and the [[population growth]] rate peaked at 3.4% in 1985. At the 2006 census, the population had reached 298,968,<ref>{{cite web|title=Islands by Population Size and Percentage Share of Total Population |url=http://www.planning.gov.mv/publications/census2006_island_level_tables/population/population/PP_05.htm |work=Maldives: Population and Housing Census 2006 |publisher=Ministry of Planning and National Development |accessdate=8 February 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919044405/http://www.planning.gov.mv/publications/census2006_island_level_tables/population/population/PP_05.htm |archivedate=19 September 2013 }}</ref> although the census in 2000 showed that the population growth rate had declined to 1.9%. Life expectancy at birth stood at 46 years in 1978, and later rose to 72. Infant mortality has declined from 12.7% in 1977 to 1.2% today, and adult literacy reached 99%. Combined school enrolment reached the high 90s. The population was projected to have reached 317,280 in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Census Analysis 2006.

The 2014 Population and Housing Census listed the total population in Maldives as 402,071: 338,434 resident Maldivians and 63,637 resident foreigners, approximately 16% of the total population. However, it is believed that foreigners have been undercounted.<ref name="prb-maldives">{{cite web |title=Maldives' Population Dynamics |url=https://www.prb.org/maldives-population-dynamics/ |accessdate=1 February 2019}}</ref> There are 40,000 [[Bangladeshis in the Maldives]], making them the largest group of foreigners working in that country.<ref>[http://www.independent-bangladesh.com/200808018336/country/maldives-to-recruit-bangladeshi-workers.html Maldives to recruit more Bangladeshi workers, SATURDAY, 02 AUGUST 2008].</ref> Other immigrants include [[Filipinos in the Maldives]] as well as various Western foreign workers.

Maldivians converted to Islam by the mid-12th century. The islands have had a long history of [[Sufi]]c orders, as can be seen in the history of the country such as the building of tombs. They were used until as recently as the 1980s for seeking the help of buried [[saint]]s. They can be seen next to some old mosques and are considered a part of Maldives's [[cultural heritage]].

Other aspects of [[tassawuf]], such as ritualised [[dhikr]] ceremonies called Maulūdu ([[Mawlid]])—the [[liturgy]] of which included recitations and certain supplications in a melodical tone—existed until very recent times. These Maulūdu festivals were held in ornate tents specially built for the occasion. At present Islam is the official religion of the entire population, as adherence to it is required for citizenship.

According to Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]], the person responsible for this conversion was a Sunni Muslim visitor named [[Abu al-Barakat]], sailing from [[Morocco]]. He is also referred to as [[Tabrizugefaanu]]. His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of the Friday Mosque, or [[Malé Friday Mosque|Hukuru Miskiy]], in Malé. Built in 1656, this is the country's oldest mosque.

===Languages===
{{main|Languages of Maldives}}
[[File:Dhivehiscript.svg|thumb|Thaana script]]
The official and common language is [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], an [[Indo-Aryan language]] having some similarities with [[Elu]], the ancient [[Sinhala language|Sinhalese]] language. The first known script used to write Dhivehi is [[Eveyla akuru]] script which is found in historical recording of kings ([[raadhavalhi]]). Later a script called [[Dhives akuru]] was used for a long period. The present-day script is called [[Thaana]] and is written from right to left. Thaana is said to have been introduced by the reign of [[Muhammad Thakurufaanu Al Auzam|Mohamed Thakurufaanu]].

English is widely spoken by the locals of Maldives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maldives.tourism-srilanka.com/travel-tips/language.html|title=Maldives Languages – Languages of Maldives – Language Spoken In Maldives|website=maldives.tourism-srilanka.com}}</ref> The spread of English has reached almost every corner of the world, and the Republic of the Maldives is no exception. Following the nation's opening to the outside world, the introduction of English as a medium of instruction at secondary and tertiary level of education, and its government's recognition of the opportunities offered through tourism, English has now firmly established itself in the country. As such, Maldives is quite similar to the countries in the Gulf region (cf. Randall & Samimi, 2010; Boyle, 2012). The nation is undergoing vast societal change, and English is part of this.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meierkord|first=Christiane|date=March 2018|title=English in paradise: the Maldives: English is rapidly establishing itself as a second language in a society transforming from fishing to tourism and trade|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/english-today/article/english-in-paradise-the-maldives/84E0B35287213D3E1A7645FFD32BC16D|journal=English Today|volume=34|issue=1|pages=2–11|doi=10.1017/S0266078417000475|issn=0266-0784}}</ref>

Since the 12th century AD there were also influences from [[Arabia]] in the language and culture of the Maldives because of the conversion to Islam and its location as a crossroads in the central Indian Ocean. This was due to the long trading history between the far east and the middle east.
However, unlike the Sinhalese of Sri Lanka and most of the Arabs, Africans and Europeans whose influence can be seen in loanwords, material culture, and the diversity of Maldivian phenotype, Maldivians do not have the highly embedded patriarchal codes of honour, purity, corporate marriage, and sedentary private property that are typical of places where agriculture is the key form of subsistence and social relations have been built, historically, around tribute taking.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Reflective of this is the fact that the Maldives has had the highest national divorce rate in the world for many decades. This, it is hypothesised, is due to a combination of liberal Islamic rules about divorce and the relatively loose marital bonds that have been identified as common in non- and semi-sedentary peoples without a history of fully developed agrarian property and kinship relations.<ref>Marcus, Anthony. 2012.

==Transportation==
[[File:TMA Terminal.JPG|thumb|TMA Terminal]]
[[Velana International Airport]] is the principal gateway to the Maldives. International travel is available on a number of major airlines. Two Maldives based airlines also operate international flights. Privately owned [[MEGA Maldives Airlines]] has Boeing 737 and 767 aircraft and operates frequent services to Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong. Government owned [[Island Aviation Services]] (branded as Maldivian) operates to nearly all Maldives domestic airports with several [[Bombardier Dash 8]] aircraft and one [[A320]] with international service to Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram, India, and Dhaka, Bangladesh.

In Maldives there are three main ways to travel between islands: by domestic flight, by [[seaplane]] or by boat.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131218100252/http://www.elitedivingagency.com/maldives/ Maldives – Élite Diving Agency]. Elitedivingagency.com. Retrieved on 29 January 2014.</ref> For several years there were two seaplane companies operating: TMA ([[Trans Maldivian Airways]]) and [[Maldivian Air Taxi]], but these merged in 2013 under the name TMA. The seaplane fleet is entirely made up of [[DHC-6 Twin Otter]]s. There is also another airline, [[Flyme (Villa Air)|Flyme]], which operates using [[ATR (aircraft manufacturer)|ATR]] planes to domestic airports, principally Maamagili and some others. The typical Maldivian boat is called a [[dhoni]]. Depending on the distance of the destination island from the airport, resorts organise domestic flight plus boat transfers, seaplane flights directly to the resort island jetty, or speedboat trips for their guests. There are also locally run ferries using large dhoni boats. Speedboats and seaplanes tend to be more expensive, while travel by dhoni, although slower, is relatively cheaper and convenient.

==Education==

The [[Maldives National University]] is one of the country's three institutions of higher education. Its mission statement is as follows:

<blockquote>To create, discover, preserve and disseminate knowledge that are necessary to enhance the lives and livelihoods of people and essential for the cultural, social and economic development of the society so that this nation shall remain free and Islamic forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mnu.edu.mv/vision-mission/|title=The Maldives National University|website=mnu.edu.mv}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1973, the Allied Health Services Training Centre (the forerunner of the Faculty of Health Sciences) was established by the Ministry of Health. The Vocational Training Centre was established in 1974, providing training for mechanical and electrical trades. In 1984, the Institute for Teacher Education was created and the School of Hotel and Catering Services was established in 1987 to provide trained personnel for the tourist industry. In 1991, the Institute of Management and Administration was created to train staff for public and private services. In 1998, the Maldives College of Higher Education was founded. The Institute of Shar'ah and Law was founded in January 1999. In 2000 the college launched its first degree programme: Bachelor of Arts. On 17 January 2011 the Maldives National University Act was passed by the President of the Maldives; The Maldives National University was named on 15 February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mnu.edu.mv/history/|title=The Maldives National University|website=mnu.edu.mv}}</ref>

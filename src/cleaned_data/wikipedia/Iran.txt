The name "Iran" disappeared from official records of the Saffarids, Samanids, Buyids, Saljuqs and their successor. But one unofficially used the name Iran, Eranshahr, and similar national designations, particularly Mamalek-e Iran or "Iranian lands", which exactly translated the old Avestan term Ariyanam Daihunam. On the other hand, when the Safavids (not Reza Shah, as is popularly assumed) revived a national state officially known as Iran, bureaucratic usage in the Ottoman empire and even Iran itself could still refer to it by other descriptive and traditional appellations.}}</ref>

With regard to the {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} pronunciation, more than 70% of the panelists deemed it unacceptable. Among the reasons given by those panelists were that {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} has "hawkish connotations" and sounds "angrier", "xenophobic", "ignorant", and "not...cosmopolitan". The {{IPAc-en|aɪ|ˈ|r|æ|n}} pronunciation remains standard and acceptable, reflected in the entry for ''Iran'' in the American Heritage Dictionary itself, as well as in each of the other major dictionaries of American English.

[[File:Pasargad Tomb Cyrus3.jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Cyrus the Great]], the founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], in [[Pasargadae]].]]
In 550&nbsp;BC, [[Cyrus the Great]], the son of [[Mandane of Media|Mandane]] and [[Cambyses I]], took over the Median Empire, and founded the Achaemenid Empire by unifying other city-states. The conquest of Media was a result of what is called the ''[[Persian Revolt]]''. The [[brouhaha]] was initially triggered by the actions of the Median ruler [[Astyages]], and was quickly spread to other provinces, as they allied with the Persians. Later conquests under Cyrus and his successors expanded the empire to include [[Lydia]], [[Babylon]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], parts of the [[Balkans]] and [[Eastern Europe]] proper, as well as the lands to the west of the [[Indus River|Indus]] and [[Oxus River|Oxus]] rivers.

539 BC was the year in which Persian forces defeated the Babylonian army at [[Opis]], and marked the end of around four centuries of Mesopotamian domination of the region by conquering the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. Cyrus entered Babylon and presented himself as a traditional Mesopotamian monarch. Subsequent Achaemenid art and iconography reflect the influence of the new political reality in Mesopotamia.

Most of the era of the Sasanian Empire was overshadowed by the [[Roman–Persian Wars]], which raged on the western borders at Anatolia, the [[Western Caucasus]], Mesopotamia, and the [[Levant]], for over 700 years. These wars exhausted both the Romans and the Sasanians and led to the defeat of both by the Muslim invasion.

Throughout the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras, several offshoots of the Iranian dynasties established [[eponymous]] branches in Anatolia and the Caucasus, including the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic Kingdom]], the [[Mihranids]], and the Arsacid dynasties of [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia|Armenia]], [[Arsacid dynasty of Iberia|Iberia]] ([[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), and [[Arsacid dynasty of Caucasian Albania|Caucasian Albania]] (present-day [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]] and southern [[Dagestan]]).

The Safavid era saw the start of mass integration from [[peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasian populations]] into new layers of the society of Iran, as well as mass resettlement of them within the heartlands of Iran, playing a pivotal role in the history of Iran for centuries onwards. Following a gradual decline in the late 1600s and the early 1700s, which was caused by internal conflicts, the continuous wars with the Ottomans, and the foreign interference (most notably the Russian interference), the Safavid rule was ended by the [[Hotak dynasty|Pashtun rebels]] who besieged Isfahan and defeated [[Sultan Husayn]] in 1722.

In 1729, [[Nader Shah]], a chieftain and military genius from [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], successfully drove out and conquered the Pashtun invaders. He subsequently took back the annexed Caucasian territories which [[Treaty of Constantinople (1724)|were divided]] among the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire|Russian]] authorities by the ongoing chaos in Iran. During the reign of Nader Shah, Iran reached its greatest extent since the Sasanian Empire, reestablishing the Iranian hegemony all over the [[Caucasus]], as well as other major parts of the [[West Asia|west]] and [[central Asia]], and briefly possessing what was arguably the most powerful empire at the time.<ref name="books.google.nl"/>

His territorial expansion, as well as his military successes, went into a decline following the final [[Nader's Dagestan campaign|campaigns in the Northern Caucasus]] against then revolting [[Lezgins]]. The assassination of Nader Shah sparked a brief period of civil war and turmoil, after which [[Karim Khan Zand|Karim Khan]] of the [[Zand dynasty]] came to power in 1750, bringing a period of relative peace and prosperity.<ref name=Immortal/>

Compared to its preceding dynasties, the geopolitical reach of the Zand dynasty was limited. Many of the Iranian territories in the Caucasus gained ''de facto'' autonomy, and were locally ruled through various [[Khanates of the Caucasus|Caucasian khanates]]. However, despite the self-ruling, they all remained [[commoner|subjects]] and vassals to the Zand king.<ref>Encyclopedia of Soviet law By Ferdinand Joseph Maria Feldbrugge, Gerard Pieter van den Berg, William B.

On 22 September 1980, the Iraqi army [[Iran–Iraq War#1980: Iraqi invasion|invaded the western Iranian province of Khuzestan]], launching the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. Although the forces of Saddam Hussein made several early advances, by mid 1982, the Iranian forces successfully managed to [[Iran–Iraq War#1982: Iraqi retreat, Iranian offensive|drive the Iraqi army back]] into Iraq. In July 1982, with Iraq thrown on the defensive, the regime of Iran took the decision to invade Iraq and conducted countless offensives in a bid to conquer Iraqi territory and capture cities, such as Basra. The war continued until 1988 when the Iraqi army defeated the Iranian forces inside Iraq and pushed the remaining Iranian troops back across the border. Subsequently, Khomeini accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 598|a truce mediated by the United Nations]].

Iran has an area of {{convert|1648195|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="CIA"/> It lies between latitudes [[24th parallel north|24°]] and [[40th parallel north|40° N]], and longitudes [[44th meridian east|44°]] and [[64th meridian east|64° E]]. It is bordered to the northwest by [[Armenia]] ({{convert|35|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), the Azeri exclave of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]] ({{convert|179|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aj.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> and the [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]] ({{convert|611|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}); to the north by the [[Caspian Sea]]; to the northeast by [[Turkmenistan]] ({{convert|992|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}); to the east by [[Afghanistan]] ({{convert|936|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Pakistan]] ({{convert|909|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}); to the south by the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Gulf of Oman]]; and to the west by [[Iraq]] ({{convert|1458|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Turkey]] ({{convert|499|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

Iran consists of the [[Iranian Plateau]], with the exception of the coasts of the Caspian Sea and [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]]. It is one of the world's most mountainous countries, its landscape dominated by rugged [[mountain range]]s that separate various [[drainage basin|basins]] or [[plateau]]x from one another. The populous western part is the most mountainous, with ranges such as the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros]], and [[Alborz]], the last containing [[Mount Damavand]], Iran's highest point at {{convert|5610|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, which is also the highest mountain on the Eurasian landmass west of the [[Hindu Kush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.surfwax.com/geography/files/Hindu_Kush_Mountains.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624014628/http://news.surfwax.com/geography/files/Hindu_Kush_Mountains.html|archivedate=24 June 2011|title=SurfWax: News, Reviews and Articles On Hindu Kush|publisher=News.surfwax.com| accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref>

The northern part of Iran is covered by the lush lowland [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests]], located near the southern shores of the Caspian Sea. The eastern part consists mostly of [[desert]] basins, such as the [[Dasht-e Kavir|Kavir Desert]], which is the country's largest desert, and the [[Dasht-e Loot|Lut Desert]], as well as some [[salt lake]]s.

The only large [[plain]]s are found along the coast of the Caspian Sea and at the northern end of the Persian Gulf, where the country borders the mouth of the [[Shatt al-Arab|Arvand river]]. Smaller, discontinuous plains are found along the remaining coast of the Persian Gulf, the [[Strait of Hormuz]], and the Gulf of Oman.

Ultimate power rests in the hands of the country's [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader]], Ayatollah [[Ali Khamenei]], and the unelected institutions under his control. Human rights abuses continued unabated in 2016, with the authorities carrying out Iran's largest mass execution in years and launching a renewed crackdown on women's rights activists. The regime maintained restrictions on freedom of expression, both offline and online, and made further arrests of journalists, bloggers, labor union activists, and dual nationals visiting the country, with some facing heavy prison sentences. Hard-liners in control of powerful institutions, including the judiciary and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), were behind many of the year's abuses. There were no indications that President Hassan Rouhani, a self-proclaimed moderate seeking reelection in 2017, was willing or able to push back against repressive forces and deliver the greater social freedoms he had promised. Opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi, his wife Zahra Rahnavard, and reformist cleric Mehdi Karroubi remained under house arrest for a sixth year without being formally charged or put on trial. As in 2015, the media were barred from quoting or reporting on former president Mohammad Khatami, another important reformist figure.}}</ref> Since the 2000s, Iran's controversial [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]] has [[Views on the nuclear program of Iran|raised concerns]], which is part of the basis of the [[Sanctions against Iran|international sanctions against the country]].

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Iran}}

The majority of the population speak [[Persian language|Persian]], which is also the [[official language]] of the country. Others include speakers of a number of other [[Iranian languages]] within the greater [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family, and languages belonging to some other ethnicities living in Iran.

In northern Iran, mostly confined to [[Gilan Province|Gilan]] and [[Mazandaran Province|Mazenderan]], the [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]] and [[Mazanderani language|Mazenderani]] languages are widely spoken, both having affinities to the neighboring [[Languages of the Caucasus|Caucasian languages]]. In parts of Gilan, the [[Talysh language]] is also widely spoken, which stretches up to the neighboring [[Azerbaijan|Republic of Azerbaijan]]. Varieties of [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]] are widely spoken in the province of [[Kurdistan Province|Kurdistan]] and nearby areas. In [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], [[Persian dialects in Khuzestan|several distinct varieties of Persian]] are spoken. [[Luri language|Lurish]] and [[Achomi language|Lari]] are also spoken in southern Iran.

[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani Turkish]], which is by far the most spoken language in the country after Persian,<ref>Annika Rabo, Bo Utas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rWEbrv5oD8AC ''The Role of the State in West Asia''] Swedish Research Institute in Istanbul, 2005 {{ISBN|91-86884-13-1}}</ref> as well as a number of other [[Turkic languages]] and dialects, is spoken in various regions of Iran, especially in the region of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]].

Notable minority languages in Iran include [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]], and [[Arabic]]. [[Khuzestani Arabic|Khuzi Arabic]] is spoken by the [[Ahwazi Arabs|Arabs in Khuzestan]], as well as the wider group of [[Iranian Arabs]]. [[Circassian languages|Circassian]] was also once widely spoken by the large Circassian minority, but, due to assimilation over the many years, no sizable number of Circassians speak the language anymore.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=stl97FdyRswC&pg=PA141&lpg=PA141 ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East''] Facts On File, Incorporated {{ISBN|1-4381-2676-X}} p. 141</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-iv--2 |title=Georgia viii: Georgian communities in Persia |last1=Oberling |first1=Pierre |date=7 February 2012 |website=[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]] |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mcha.kbsu.ru/english/m_hist_01E.htm.html |title=Circassian |publisher=Official Circassian Association |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://iranian.com/Travelers/June97/Chardin/index.shtml |title=Persians: Kind, hospitable, tolerant flattering cheats? |first1=Sir John |last1=Chardin |authorlink=Jean Chardin |date=June 1997 |journal=[[Iranian.com|The Iranian]] |accessdate=9 June 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970620173929/http://www.iranian.com/Travelers/June97/Chardin/index.shtml |archivedate=20 June 1997 |deadurl=no}} Excerpted from:

Percentages of spoken language continue to be a point of debate, as many opt that they are politically motivated; most notably regarding the largest and second largest ethnicities in Iran, the Persians and [[Azerbaijanis]]. Percentages given by the [[CIA]]'s [[World Factbook]] include 53% Persian, 16% [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani Turkish]], 10% [[Kurdish languages|Kurdish]], 7% [[Mazanderani language|Mazenderani]] and [[Gilaki language|Gilaki]], 7% [[Luri language|Lurish]], 2% [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], 2% [[Balochi language|Balochi]], 2% [[Arabic]], and 2% the remainder [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]], and [[Circassian languages|Circassian]].<ref name=":1" />

As with the spoken languages, the ethnic group composition also remains a point of debate, mainly regarding the largest and second largest ethnic groups, the Persians and Azerbaijanis, due to the lack of Iranian state censuses based on ethnicity. [[The World Factbook|The CIA's World Factbook]] has estimated that around 79% of the population of Iran are a diverse [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic group]] that comprise the speakers of the [[Iranian languages]],<ref>J. Harmatta in "History of Civilizations of Central Asia", Chapter 14, ''The Emergence of Indo-Iranians: The Indo-Iranian Languages'', ed. by A. H. Dani & V.N. Masson, 1999, p. 357</ref> with [[Persian people|Persians]] (incl. [[Mazanderani people|Mazenderanis]] and [[Gilaks]]) constituting 61% of the population, [[Kurds]] 10%, [[Lurs]] 6%, and [[Baloch people|Balochs]] 2%. Peoples of other ethno-linguistic groups make up the remaining 21%, with [[Iranian Azerbaijanis|Azerbaijanis]] constituting 16%, [[Arabs]] 2%, [[Turkmens]] and other [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] 2%, and others (such as [[Iranian Armenians|Armenians]], [[Talysh people|Talysh]], [[Iranian Georgians|Georgians]], [[Circassians in Iran|Circassians]], [[Iranian Assyrians|Assyrians]]) 1%.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |title=The World Factbook: Iran |work=CIA |date=2012 |at=People and Society |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119021206/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ir.html |archivedate=19 November 2012 }}</ref>

The [[Library of Congress]] issued slightly different estimates: 65% Persians (incl. Mazenderanis, Gilaks, and the Talysh), 16% Azerbaijanis, 7% Kurds, 6% Lurs, 2% Baloch, 1% Turkic tribal groups (incl. [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] and [[Turkmens]]), and non-Iranian, non-Turkic groups (incl. Armenians, Georgians, Assyrians, Circassians, and Arabs) less than 3%. It determined that Persian is the first language of at least 65% of the country's population, and is the second language for most of the remaining 35%.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/cs/pdf/CS_Iran.pdf#27 |title=Country Profile: Iran |publisher=[[Federal Research Division]], [[Library of Congress]] |location=Washington, D.C. |date=May 2008 |page=xxvi |format=PDF |accessdate=9 June 2014}}</ref>

Other non-governmental estimations regarding the groups other than the Persians and Azerbaijanis roughly congruate with the World Factbook and the Library of Congress. However, many scholarly and organisational estimations regarding the number of these two groups differ significantly from the mentioned census. According to many of them, the number of ethnic Azerbaijanis in Iran comprises between 21.6–30% of the total population, with the majority holding it on 25%.{{ref|New America Foundation|c}}<ref name="New America Foundation">{{cite news|url=http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/TFT%20Iran%20Survey%20Report%200609.pdf |title=Results a new nationwide public opinion survey of Iran |publisher=[[New America Foundation]] |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723044939/http://www.terrorfreetomorrow.org/upimagestft/TFT%20Iran%20Survey%20Report%200609.pdf |archivedate=23 July 2013 |df= }}</ref>{{ref|Minority Rights|d}}<ref name="Minority Rights">{{cite news|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/?lid=5096|title=Azeris |publisher=[[Minority Rights Group International]] |year= 2009 |accessdate=16 October 2013}}</ref><ref>

Historically, early [[Iranian religions]] such as the Proto-Iranic religion and the subsequent [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Manichaeism]] were the dominant religions in Iran, particularly during the Median, Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian eras. This changed after the fall of the Sasanian Empire by the centuries-long [[Islamization of Iran|Islamization]] that followed the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Muslim Conquest of Iran]]. Iran was predominantly Sunni until the conversion of the country (as well as the people of what is today the neighboring Republic of Azerbaijan) to [[Shia]] Islam by the order of the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the 16th century.<ref name="Abdullah2014"/>

[[File:Raffael 071.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zoroaster]], the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], depicted on [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]''.]]

Iranian philosophy originates from [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Indo-European]] roots, with [[Zoroaster]]'s reforms having major influences.

According to ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', the chronology of the subject and science of philosophy starts with the Indo-Iranians, dating this event to 1500 BC. The Oxford dictionary also states, "Zarathushtra's philosophy entered to influence Western tradition through Judaism, and therefore on [[Middle Platonism]]."

While there are [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|ancient relations]] between the Indian [[Vedas]] and the Iranian [[Avesta]], the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences, especially in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view of man's role in the universe.

The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], which is known as "the first charter of [[human rights]]", is often seen as a reflection of the questions and thoughts expressed by Zoroaster, and developed in Zoroastrian schools of the Achaemenid era.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Kreyenbroek, Philip G. |title=Morals and Society in Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy |encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy |first1=Brian |last1=Carr |first2=Indira |last2=Mahalingam |publisher=Routledge |year=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |editor=Boyce, Mary |title=The Origins of Zoroastrian Philosophy" in "Persian Philosophy |encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy |first1=Brian |last1=Carr |first2=Indira |last2=Mahalingam |publisher=Routledge |year=2009}}</ref> The earliest tenets of Zoroastrian schools are part of the extant scriptures of the Zoroastrian religion in [[Avestan]].

===Mythology===
{{Main|Iranian mythology|Iranian folklore}}
[[File:Arash statue in Sa'dābād palace.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Arash|Arash the Archer]] at the [[Sa'dabad Complex]] in Tehran.]]

[[Iranian mythology]] consists of ancient [[Iranian folklore]] and stories, all involving extraordinary beings, reflecting attitudes towards the confrontation of [[good and evil]], actions of the gods, and the exploits of heroes and fabulous creatures.

Myths play a crucial part in Iranian culture, and understanding of them is increased when they are considered within the context of actual events in Iranian history. The geography of Greater Iran, a vast area covering present-day Iran, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Mesopotamia and Central Asia, with its high mountain ranges, plays the main role in much of Iranian mythology.

10th-century Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]]'s long [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Shahnameh|Šāhnāme]]'' ("Book of Kings"), which is for the most part based on ''Xwadāynāmag'', a [[Middle Persian]] compilation of the history of Iranian kings and heroes from mythical times down to the reign of [[Khosrow II|Chosroes II]],<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdowsi#ref69128 |title=Ferdowsī |author=Boyle, John Andrew |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |access-date=18 July 2017}}</ref> is considered the [[national epic]] of Iran. It draws heavily on the stories and characters of the Zoroastrian tradition, from the texts of the [[Avesta]], the [[Denkard]], and the [[Bundahishn]].

===Music===

[[File:Karna-Persian-Instrument-Persepolis-Museum.JPG|thumb|[[Zurna|Karna]], an ancient Iranian musical instrument from the 6th century BC, kept at the Persepolis Museum.]]

Iran is the apparent birthplace of the earliest complex instruments, dating back to the third millennium BC.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/music-history-i-pre-islamic-iran |title=Music History |trans-title=i. Third Millenium B.C.E. |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica}}</ref> The use of both vertical and horizontal angular [[harp]]s have been documented at the sites Madaktu and [[Kul-e Farah]], with the largest collection of [[Elam]]ite instruments documented at Kul-e Farah. Multiple depictions of horizontal harps were also sculpted in Assyrian palaces, dating back between 865 and 650 BC.

[[Xenophon]]'s ''[[Cyropaedia]]'' mentions a great number of singing women at the court of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. [[Athenaeus]] of [[Naucratis]], in his ''[[Deipnosophistae]]'', points out to the capture of Achaemenid singing girls at the court of the last Achaemenid king [[Darius III]] (336–330 BC) by [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] general [[Parmenion]]. Under the [[Parthian Empire]], the ''[[Gusans|gōsān]]'' ([[Parthian language|Parthian]] for "minstrel") had a prominent role in the society.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/gosan |title=GŌSĀN |volume=Xi |pages=167–170 |access-date=15 July 2017}}</ref> According to [[Plutarch]]'s ''Life of Crassus'' (32.3), they praised their national heroes and ridiculed their Roman rivals. Likewise, [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'' reports that the Parthian youth were taught songs about "the deeds both of the gods and of the noblest men".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GMtfAAAAMAAJ |title=Geography |volume=7 |author=[[Strabo]] |publisher=Harvard University Press |publication-date=1983 |location=London |page=179|isbn=978-0-674-99266-5 }}</ref>

Iran's first symphony orchestra, the [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]], was founded by Qolam-Hoseyn Minbashian in 1933. It was reformed by [[Parviz Mahmoud]] in 1946, and is currently Iran's oldest and largest symphony orchestra.

===Theater===
{{Main|Persian theater|Persian dance}}
[[File:RudakiHall.jpg|thumb|The [[Roudaki Hall]], constructed between 1957 and 1967 in [[Tehran]].]]

The earliest recorded representations of dancing figures within Iran were found in prehistoric sites such as Tepe Sialk and Tepe Mūsīān.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/dance-raqs |title=Dance |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|access-date=26 October 2015}}</ref> The oldest Iranian initiation of theater and the phenomena of acting can be traced in the ancient epic ceremonial theaters such as ''Sug-e Siāvuš'' ("mourning of [[Siyâvash|Siāvaš]]"), as well as dances and theater narrations of Iranian mythological tales reported by [[Herodotus]] and [[Xenophon]].

Iran's traditional theatrical genres include Baqqāl-bāzi ("grocer play", a form of slapstick comedy), Ruhowzi (or ''Taxt-howzi'', comedy performed over a courtyard pool covered with boards), Siāh-bāzi (in which the central comedian appears in blackface), Sāye-bāzi ([[shadow play]]), Xeyme-šab-bāzi ([[marionette]]), and Arusak-bāzi ([[puppetry]]), and [[Ta'zieh|Ta'zie]] (religious tragedy plays).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/drama |title=DRAMA |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica|access-date=20 July 2017 |volume=VII |pages=529–535}}</ref>

Before the 1979 Revolution, the Iranian national stage had become a famous performing scene for known international artists and troupes,<ref>{{cite book |author=Kiann, Nima |date=2015 |title=The History of Ballet in Iran |location=Wiesbaden |publisher=Reichert Publishing}}</ref> with the [[Roudaki Hall]] of Tehran constructed to function as the national stage for [[opera]] and [[ballet]]. Opened on 26 October 1967, the hall is home to the [[Tehran Symphony Orchestra]], the Tehran Opera Orchestra, and the [[Iranian National Ballet Company]], and was officially renamed ''Vahdat Hall'' after the 1979 Revolution.

[[Loris Tjeknavorian]]'s ''[[Rostam and Sohrab (opera)|Rostam and Sohrab]]'', based on the tragedy of ''[[Rostam and Sohrab]]'' from [[Ferdowsi]]'s epic poem ''[[Shahnameh|Šāhnāme]]'', is an example of opera with Persian [[libretto]]. Tjeknavorian, a celebrated [[Iranian Armenians|Iranian Armenian]] composer and conductor, composed it in 25 years, and it was finally performed for the first time at Tehran's Roudaki Hall, with [[Darya Dadvar]] in the role of [[Tahmina]].

By the early 20th century, the five-year-old industry of cinema came to Iran. The first Iranian filmmaker was probably [[Mirza Ebrahim Khan Akkas Bashi|Mirza Ebrahim (Akkas Bashi)]], the court photographer of [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar|Mozaffar-ed-Din Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]]. Mirza Ebrahim obtained a camera and filmed the Qajar ruler's visit to Europe.

Until the early 1930s, there were around 15 cinema theaters in Tehran and 11 in other provinces.<ref name="horschamp1"/> The first Iranian feature film, ''[[Abi and Rabi]]'', was a silent comedy directed by [[Ovanes Ohanian]] in 1930.

Attempts to organize a film festival, which had begun in 1954 within the framework of the Golrizan Festival, resulted in the festival of Sepas in 1969.

Due to its variety of ethnic groups and the influences from the neighboring cultures, the cuisine of Iran is diverse. Herbs are frequently used, along with fruits such as plums, pomegranate, quince, prunes, apricots, and raisins. To achieve a balanced taste, characteristic flavorings such as saffron, dried lime, cinnamon, and parsley are mixed delicately and used in some special dishes. Onion and garlic are commonly used in the preparation of the accompanying course, but are also served separately during meals, either in raw or pickled form.

Iranian cuisine includes a wide range of main dishes, including various types of [[kebab]], [[pilaf]], [[stew]] ([[khoresh]]), [[soup]] and [[āsh]], and [[omelette]]. Lunch and dinner meals are commonly accompanied by side dishes such as plain [[yogurt]] or [[tzatziki|mast-o-khiar]], [[sabzi khordan|sabzi]], [[Shirazi salad|salad Shirazi]], and [[tursu|torshi]], and might follow dishes such as [[borani]], [[Mirza Ghassemi|Mirza Qasemi]], or [[kashk e bademjan]] as the appetizer.

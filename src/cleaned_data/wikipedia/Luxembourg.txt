The history of Luxembourg is considered to begin in 963, when count [[Sigfried, Count of the Ardennes|Siegfried I]] acquired a rocky promontory and its Roman-era fortifications known as ''Lucilinburhuc'', ′little castle′, and the surrounding area from the [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier|Imperial Abbey of St. Maximin]] in nearby [[Trier]].<ref>{{cite book |year=2008 |title=A propos...

Siegfried's descendants increased their territory through marriage, war and vassal relations. At the end of the 13th century, the [[Counts of Luxembourg]] reigned over a considerable territory.

In 1308, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII, Count of Luxembourg]] became [[King of the Germans]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The [[House of Luxembourg]] produced four [[Holy Roman Emperors]] during the high Middle Ages. In 1354, [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] elevated the County to the [[Duchy of Luxembourg]]. Since [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] had no male heir, the Duchy became part of the [[Burgundian Circle]] and then one of the [[Seventeen Provinces]] of the Habsburg Netherlands.<ref>{{cite book |year=2008 |title=A propos...

Over the centuries, the [[Fortress of Luxembourg|City and Fortress of Luxembourg]], of great strategic importance situated between the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Habsburg]] territories, was gradually built up to be one of the most reputed [[fortifications]] in Europe. After belonging to both the France of [[Louis XIV]] and the Austria of [[Maria Theresia]], Luxembourg became part of the [[First French Republic]] and [[First French Empire|Empire]] under [[Napoleon]].<ref>{{cite book |year=2008 |title=A propos...

The present-day state of Luxembourg first emerged at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. The Grand-Duchy, with its powerful fortress, became an independent state under the personal possession of [[William I of the Netherlands]] with a [[Prussia]]n garrison to guard the city against another invasion from France.<ref>{{cite book |year=2008 |title=A propos...

Luxembourg is a founding member of the European Union, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[United Nations]], [[NATO]], and [[Benelux]]. The city of Luxembourg, which is the country's capital and largest city, is the seat of several institutions and agencies of the EU.

=== County ===
{{Main|County of Luxemburg}}

The recorded history of Luxembourg begins with the acquisition of Lucilinburhuc<ref>Kreins (2003), p. 20</ref> (today [[Luxembourg Castle]]) situated on the [[Bock (Luxembourg)|Bock]] rock by [[Siegfried of Luxembourg|Siegfried, Count of Ardennes]], in 963 through an exchange act with [[St. Maximin's Abbey, Trier]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gouvernement.lu/publications/luxembourg/apropos_histoire/ap_histoire_2008_EN.pdf |title=History of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202013230/http://www.gouvernement.lu/publications/luxembourg/apropos_histoire/ap_histoire_2008_EN.pdf |archivedate=2 February 2012}}</ref> Around this [[Fortifications|fort]], a [[town]] gradually developed, which became the centre of a state of great strategic value.

=== Duchy ===
{{Main|Duchy of Luxemburg}}

In the 14th and early 15th centuries, three members of the [[House of Luxembourg]] reigned as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s. In 1437, the House of Luxembourg suffered a succession crisis, precipitated by the lack of a male heir to assume the throne, which led to the territories being sold by Duchess [[Elisabeth, Duchess of Luxembourg|Elisabeth]] to [[Philip the Good]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]].<ref>Kreins (2003), p. 39</ref>

In the following centuries, Luxembourg's fortress was steadily enlarged and strengthened by its successive occupants, the [[Bourbons]], [[Habsburg]]s, [[Hohenzollern]]s and the French.

=== Nineteenth century ===
After the [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|defeat]] of [[Napoleon]] in 1815, Luxembourg was disputed between [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Netherlands]]. The [[Congress of Vienna]] formed Luxembourg as a [[Grand Duchy]] within the [[German Confederation]]. The Dutch king became, in [[personal union]], the grand duke. Although he was supposed to rule the grand duchy as an independent country with an administration of its own, in reality he treated it similarly to a Dutch province. The [[Fortress of Luxembourg]] was manned by Prussian troops for the German Confederation.<ref>Johan Christiaan Boogman: Nederland en de Duitse Bond 1815–1851. Diss. Utrecht, J. B. Wolters, Groningen / Djakarta 1955, pp. 5–8.</ref> This arrangement was revised by the 1839 [[Treaty of London, 1839|First Treaty of London]], from which date Luxembourg's full independence is reckoned.<ref>Thewes, Guy (2006) (PDF). Les gouvernements du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg depuis 1848 (2006), p. 208</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.landenweb.net/luxemburg/geschiedenis/ |title=LUXEMBURG Geschiedenis |publisher=Landenweb.net |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2088.html |title=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=1 February 2013}}</ref><ref>Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 1997</ref>

At the time of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830–1839, and by the 1839 Treaty establishing full independence, Luxembourg's territory was reduced by more than half, as the predominantly [[francophone]] [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|western part of the country]] was transferred to [[Belgium]]. In 1842 Luxembourg joined the German Customs Union ([[Zollverein]]).<ref>Kreins (2003), p. 76</ref> This resulted in the opening of the German market, the development of [[Steel industry in Luxembourg|Luxembourg's steel industry]], and expansion of [[Société Nationale des Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois|Luxembourg's railway network]] from 1855 to 1875, particularly the construction of the Luxembourg-[[Thionville]] railway line, with connections from there to the European industrial regions.<ref>Jean-Marie Kreins, ''Histoire du Luxembourg'', 5th edition, Presses Universitaires de France, 2010</ref> While Prussian troops still manned the fortress, in 1861, the [[Passerelle (Luxembourg)|Passerelle]] was opened, the first road bridge spanning the [[Pétrusse]] river valley, connecting the [[Ville Haute]] and the main fortification on the Bock with [[Luxembourg railway station]], opened in 1859, on the then fortified Bourbon plateau to the south.

[[File:Grund, Luxembourg from wall above.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Grund, Luxembourg|Grund]] along [[Alzette]] river in the historical heart of Luxembourg City.]]
After the [[Luxembourg Crisis]] of 1866 nearly led to war between Prussia and France, the Grand Duchy's independence and neutrality were again affirmed by the 1867 [[Treaty of London, 1867|Second Treaty of London]], Prussia's troops were withdrawn from the Fortress of Luxembourg, and its Bock and surrounding fortifications were dismantled.<ref>Kreins (2003), pp. 80–81</ref>

The [[King of the Netherlands]] remained [[Head of State]] as [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], maintaining a personal union between the two countries until 1890. At the death of [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]], the throne of the Netherlands passed to his daughter [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Wilhelmina]], while Luxembourg (then restricted to male heirs by the [[Nassau Family Pact]]) passed to [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolph of Nassau-Weilburg]].<ref>Kreins (2003), p. 84</ref>

At the time of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] in 1870, despite allegations about French use of the Luxembourg railways for passing soldiers from [[Metz]] (then part of France) through the Duchy, and for forwarding provisions to Thionville, Luxembourg's neutrality was respected by [[North German Confederation|Germany]], and neither France nor Germany invaded the country.<ref>{{cite book |work=Oakes and Mowat |title=The Great European treaties of the nineteenth century |page=259 |publisher=The Clarendon Press |year=1918 |url=https://archive.org/stream/greateuropeantre00oakeiala/greateuropeantre00oakeiala_djvu.txt}}</ref><ref>Maartje Abbenhuis, ''An Age of Neutrals: Great Power Politics, 1815–1914''. Cambridge University Press (2014) {{ISBN|978-1107037601}}</ref> But in 1871, as a result of Germany's victory over France, Luxembourg's boundary with [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]], containing Metz and Thionville, changed from being a frontier with a part of France to a frontier with territory annexed to the [[German Empire]] as [[Alsace-Lorraine]] under the [[Treaty of Frankfurt (1871)|Treaty of Frankfurt]]. This allowed Germany the military advantage of controlling and expanding the [[Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine|railways there]].

=== Twentieth century ===
[[File:Alsace-lorraine.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Frontier with German Empire's Alsace-Lorraine, from 1871 to 1918]]

In August 1914, [[Imperial Germany]] violated Luxembourg's neutrality in the war by invading it in the war against France. This allowed Germany to use the railway lines, while at the same time denying them to France. Nevertheless, despite the [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I|German occupation]], Luxembourg was allowed to maintain much of its independence and political mechanisms.
[[File:La belle Gëlle Fra à Luxembourg-ville.jpg|thumb|center| The Golden Lady World War I memorial monument of the capital of Luxembourg]]


In 1940, after the outbreak of [[World War II]], Luxembourg's neutrality was again violated when the [[Wehrmacht]] of [[Nazi Germany]] entered the country, "entirely without justification".<ref>{{cite web |title=The invasion of Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg |work=Judgment of the International Military Tribunal For The Trial of German Major War Criminals'' |location=London HMSO 1951 |url=http://www.nizkor.org/ftp.cgi?imt/tgmwc/judgment/j-invasion-belgium}}</ref> In contrast to the First World War, under the [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II]], the country was treated as German territory and informally annexed to the adjacent province of the [[Third Reich]]. A [[Luxembourg government-in-exile|government in exile]] based in London supported the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], sending a small group of volunteers who participated in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Normandy invasion]]. Luxembourg was liberated in September 1944, and became a founding member of the [[United Nations]] in 1945. Luxembourg's neutral status under the [[Constitution of Luxembourg|constitution]] formally ended in 1948, and in 1949 it became a founding member of [[NATO]].

In 1951, Luxembourg became one of the six founding countries of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which in 1957 would become the [[European Economic Community]] and in 1993 the [[European Union]]. In 1999 Luxembourg joined the [[Eurozone]]. In 2005, a [[Referendum on EU treaty in Luxembourg|referendum on the EU treaty establishing a constitution for Europe]] was held.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/1061873.stm Timeline: Luxembourg – A chronology of key events] BBC News Online, 9 September 2006. Retrieved 8 October 2006.</ref>

The [[steel industry]] exploiting the [[Red Lands]]' rich iron-ore grounds in the beginning of the 20th century drove the country's industrialisation. After the decline of the steel industry in the 1970s, the country focused on establishing itself as a global financial centre and developed into the banking hub it is reputed for. Since the beginning of the 21st century, its governments have focused on developing the country into a [[knowledge economy]], with the founding of the [[University of Luxembourg]] and a national [[space programme]], projecting the first involvement in a robotic lunar expedition by 2020.<ref>[http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/actualites/2017/03/07-ispace/index.html "Le Luxembourg décroche la lune"], 'Official Portal of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg', Government of Luxembourg.''.

Luxembourg has long been a prominent supporter of European political and [[economic integration]]. In efforts foreshadowing European integration, Luxembourg and Belgium in 1921 formed the [[Belgium–Luxembourg Economic Union]] (BLEU) to create a regime of inter-exchangeable currency and a common [[Customs (tax)|customs]]. Luxembourg is a member of the [[Benelux Economic Union]] and was one of the founding members of the European Economic Community (now the European Union). It also participates in the [[Schengen Agreement|Schengen Group]] (named after [[Schengen, Luxembourg|the Luxembourg village of Schengen]] where the agreements were signed), whose goal is the free movement of citizens among member states. At the same time, the majority of Luxembourgers have consistently believed that European unity makes sense only in the context of a dynamic transatlantic relationship, and thus have traditionally pursued a pro-[[NATO]], pro-US foreign policy. {{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Luxembourg is the site of the [[European Court of Justice]], the [[European Court of Auditors]], the Statistical Office of the European Communities ("[[Eurostat]]") and other vital EU organs. The [[Secretariat of the European Parliament]] is located in Luxembourg, but the Parliament usually meets in [[Brussels]] and sometimes in [[Strasbourg]].

The Army is situated on the "Härebierg" which is Luxemburgish and translates to "men's mountain".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.armee.lu |title=Accueil |last=SA |first=Interact |website=www.armee.lu |language=fr-FR |access-date=2017-09-13}}</ref> The army is under [[civilian control of the military|civilian control]], with the [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke]] as [[Commander-in-Chief]].

The professional head of the army is the [[Chief of Defence (Luxembourg)|Chief of Defence]], who answers to the minister and holds the rank of general.

Being a landlocked country, it has no navy. Luxembourg also lacks an air force, though the 17 NATO [[Airborne Warning And Control System|AWACS]] aeroplanes are, for convenience, registered as aircraft of Luxembourg.<ref name="Aeroflight">{{cite web |url=http://www.aeroflight.co.uk/waf/lux/luxaf1.htm |title=Luxembourg |accessdate=23 July 2006 |date=8 September 2005 |publisher=Aeroflight.co.uk}}</ref> In accordance with a joint agreement with Belgium, both countries have put forth funding for one [[Airbus A400M|A400M]] military cargo plane.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/fla.htm "A400M Loadmaster, Future Large Aircraft – FLA, Avion de Transport Futur – ATF"], ''GlobalSecurity.org''.

Luxembourg has participated in the [[Eurocorps]], has contributed troops to the [[United Nations Protection Force|UNPROFOR]] and [[IFOR]] missions in former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and has participated with a small contingent in the current [[NATO]] [[SFOR]] mission in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Luxembourg troops have also deployed to [[Afghanistan]], to support [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]. The army has also participated in humanitarian relief missions such as setting up refugee camps for [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] and providing emergency supplies to Albania.<ref>* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100702110138/http://www.mnhm.lu/pageshtml/luxembourgarmy.php History of Luxembourg's Army]</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Luxembourg}}
[[File:Luxembourg-CIA WFB Map.png|thumb|The largest towns are [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]], [[Esch-sur-Alzette]], [[Dudelange]], and [[Differdange]].]]
Luxembourg is one of the smallest countries in Europe, and ranked [[List of countries by area|169th]] in size of all the [[List of sovereign states|194 independent countries of the world]]; the country is about {{convert|2,586|km2|sqmi}} in size, and measures {{convert|82|km|mi|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|57|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide. It lies between latitudes [[49th parallel north|49°]] and [[51st parallel north|51° N]], and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[7th meridian east|7° E]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/eu/lu/where-is-luxembourg.html|title=Where is Luxembourg?|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}</ref>

To the east, Luxembourg borders the German ''[[States of Germany|Bundesländer]]'' of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Saarland]], and to the south, it borders the French ''[[Région in France|région]]'' of [[Grand Est]] ([[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]). The Grand Duchy borders the Belgian [[Wallonia|Walloon Region]], in particular the latter's [[Provinces of regions in Belgium|provinces]] of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]] and [[Liège (province)|Liège]], part of which comprises the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]], to the west and to the north, respectively.

The northern third of the country is known as the '[[Oesling]]', and forms part of the [[Ardennes]]. It is dominated by hills and low mountains, including the [[Kneiff]] near Wilwerdange,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/publications/horizontales/recueil_communes/recueil_pdf.pdf |title=Mountains in Luxembourg |accessdate=24 February 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610225858/http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/publications/horizontales/recueil_communes/recueil_pdf.pdf |archivedate=10 June 2007 |df=dmy}}, recueil de statistiques par commune. statistiques.public.lu (2003) p. 20</ref> which is the highest point, at 560 metres (1,837&nbsp;ft). Other mountains are the '[[Buurgplaatz|Buurgplaaz]]' at 559 metres near [[Huldange]] and the '[[Napoléonsgaard]]' at 554 metres near [[Rambrouch]]. The region is sparsely populated, with only one town ([[Wiltz]]) with a population of more than four thousand people.

[[File:Vue op Alschent-001.JPG|thumb|Typical Luxembourg countryside near [[Alscheid]]]]

The southern two-thirds of the country is called the "[[Gutland (Luxembourg)|Gutland]]", and is more densely populated than the Oesling. It is also more diverse and can be divided into five geographic sub-regions. The [[Luxembourg plateau]], in south-central Luxembourg, is a large, flat, [[sandstone]] formation, and the site of the city of Luxembourg. [[Little Switzerland (Luxembourg)|Little Switzerland]], in the east of Luxembourg, has craggy terrain and thick forests. The [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] valley is the lowest-lying region, running along the southeastern border. The [[Red Lands]], in the far south and southwest, are Luxembourg's industrial heartland and home to many of Luxembourg's largest towns.

The border between Luxembourg and Germany is formed by three [[river]]s: the Moselle, the [[Sauer]], and the [[Our River|Our]]. Other major rivers are the [[Alzette]], the [[Attert River|Attert]], the [[Clerve]], and the [[Wiltz River|Wiltz]]. The [[valley]]s of the mid-Sauer and Attert form the border between the Gutland and the Oesling.

According to the 2012 Environmental Performance Index, Luxembourg is one of the world's best performers in environmental protection, ranking 4th out of 132 assessed countries<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120505092852/http://epi.yale.edu/epi2012/rankings |deadurl=yes |title=2012 EPI :: Rankings – Environmental Performance Index |date=5 May 2012 |archivedate=5 May 2012 |website=yale.edu}}</ref> Luxembourg also ranks 6th among the top ten most livable cities in the world by Mercer's.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newyork-cg.mae.lu/en/News/Luxembourg-City-in-the-top-10-of-the-most-livable-cities |title=MAE – Luxembourg City in the top 10 of the most "livable" cities / News / New York CG / Mini-Sites |website=Newyork-cg.mae.lu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}</ref>

The industrial sector, which was dominated by steel until the 1960s, has since diversified to include chemicals, rubber, and other products. During the past decades, growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in [[Steel industry in Luxembourg|steel production]]. Services, especially banking and [[financial export|finance]], account for the majority of economic output. Luxembourg is the world's second largest investment fund centre (after the United States), the most important private banking centre in the [[Eurozone]] and Europe's leading centre for reinsurance companies. Moreover, the Luxembourg government has aimed to attract Internet start-ups, with [[Skype]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] being two of the many Internet companies that have shifted their regional headquarters to Luxembourg. Other high-tech companies have established themselves in Luxembourg, including [[3d scanner|3D scanner]] developer/manufacturer [[Artec 3D]].

In April 2009, concern about Luxembourg's banking secrecy laws, as well as its reputation as a [[tax haven]], led to its being added to a "grey list" of nations with questionable banking arrangements by the [[G20]]. In response, the country soon after adopted OECD standards on exchange of information and was subsequently added into the category of "jurisdictions that have substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oecd.org/document/51/0,3746,en_2649_33767_43281075_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Luxembourg makes progress in OECD standards on tax information exchange |publisher=OECD |date=8 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fidomes.com/newsletter/Report-OECD.pdf |title=A progress report on the jurisdictions surveyed by the OECD Global Forum |format=PDF |date=July 2009 |publisher=OECD}}</ref> In March 2010, the ''Sunday Telegraph'' reported that most of Kim Jong-Il's $4 billion in secret accounts is in Luxembourg banks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/7442188/Kim-Jong-il-keeps-4bn-emergency-fund-in-European-banks.html |title=Kim Jong-il $4bn emergency fund in European banks |date=March 2010 |publisher=Telegraph}}</ref> Amazon.co.uk also benefits from Luxembourg tax loopholes by channeling substantial UK revenues as reported by ''The Guardian'' in April 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/apr/04/amazon-fulfilment-less-tax-uk-activities |title=How one word change lets Amazon pays less tax on its UK activities |publisher=TheGuardian |date=4 April 2012 |location=London |first=Ian |last=Griffiths}}</ref> Luxembourg ranked third on the [[Tax Justice Network]]'s 2011 [[Financial Secrecy Index]] of the world's major tax havens, scoring only slightly behind the [[Cayman Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.financialsecrecyindex.com/Archive2011/FSI-2011/FSI-Rankings.pdf |format=PDF |title=Embargo 4 October 0.01 AM Central European Times |publisher=Financialsecrecyindex.com |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> In 2013, Luxembourg is ranked as the 2nd safest tax haven in the world, behind [[Switzerland]].

In early November 2014, just days after becoming head of the [[European Commission]], the former Luxembourg's Prime Minister [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] was hit by media disclosures—derived from a document leak known as [[Luxembourg Leaks]]—that Luxembourg under his premiership had turned into a major European centre of corporate [[tax avoidance]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Luxembourg tax files: how tiny state rubber-stamped tax avoidance on an industrial scale|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale|website=The Guardian|accessdate=12 November 2014}}</ref>

Agriculture is based on small, family-owned farms.

Luxembourg has especially close trade and financial ties to Belgium and the Netherlands (see [[Benelux]]), and as a member of the EU it enjoys the advantages of the open European [[Market (economics)|market]].

With $171 billion in May 2015, the country ranks eleventh in the world in holdings of [[U.S. Treasury security|U.S. Treasury securities]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/Documents/mfh.txt |title=Major foreign holders of treasury securities |publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury}}</ref> However, securities owned by non-Luxembourg residents, but held in custodial accounts in Luxembourg, are also included in this figure.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/faqs/Treasury-International-Capital/Pages/tic-faqs.aspx |title=What are the problems of geographic attribution for securities holdings and transactions in the TIC system? |publisher=U.S. Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting system}}</ref>

Luxembourg has efficient road, rail and air transport facilities and services. The road network has been significantly modernised in recent years with {{convert|147|km|mi|abbr=on}} of motorways connecting the capital to adjacent countries. The advent of the high-speed [[TGV]] link to Paris has led to renovation of the city's [[Luxembourg railway station|railway station]] and a new passenger terminal at [[Luxembourg Airport]] was opened in 2008.

=== Language ===

{{Main|Languages of Luxembourg|Multilingualism in Luxembourg|Luxembourg literature}}
[[File:LUX-5f2.jpg|thumb|Coin of the former [[Luxembourgish franc|Luxembourg franc]] in two of the country's three languages: French (obverse, left) and Luxembourgish (reverse, right)]]
The linguistic situation of Luxembourg is complex. It is characterized by the existence of a language specific to the local population ([[Luxembourgish Language|Luxembourgish]]), mixed with the historical presence of the two major languages spoken in the surrounding countries ([[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]).

Three languages are recognised as official in Luxembourg: [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]] and [[Luxembourgish language|Luxembourgish]], a [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] language of the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] region that is also spoken in neighbouring parts of Belgium, Germany and France. Though Luxembourgish is part of the West Central German group of [[High German languages]], more than 5,000 words in the language are of French origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sprooch.com/sproochbe/conferences/conference1/Les%20origines%20et%20l%27histoire%20de%20la%20langue%20luxembourgeoise.doc |title=Origins of Luxembourgish (in French) |publisher=Migration Information Source}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/language/apprendrelu_fr.htm |title=Parlement européen – Lëtzebuergesch léieren (FR) |publisher=Europarl.europa.eu |date=14 December 2000 |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> The first printed sentences in Luxembourgish appeared in a weekly journal, the 'Luxemburger Wochenblatt', in the second edition on 14 April 1821.

Apart from being one of the three official languages, Luxembourgish is also considered the [[national language]] of the Grand Duchy; it is the mother tongue or "language of the heart" for the local population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Europeans and Their Languages |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_243_en.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=European Commission |year=2006 |accessdate=5 November 2009 |page=7}}</ref><br>
Every citizen or resident has the right to address the administration in the language of their choice among the three official languages and to be answered in that language.<br>
Due to the historical influence of the Napoleonic Code on the legal system of the Grand Duchy, French is the sole language of the legislation. French is generally the preferred language of the government, administration and justice. The parliamentary debates are however mostly conducted in Luxembourgish, whereas the written government communications and the official documents (e.g. administrative or judicial decisions, passports etc.) are drafted only in French.

Each of the three languages is used as the primary language in certain spheres of the everyday-life, without being exclusive. Luxembourgish is the language that Luxembourgers generally use to speak to each other, but it is not often used as the written language and the numerous expatriate workers (approximately 60% of the population) generally do not use it to speak to each other. Since the 1980s, however, an increasing number of novels have been written in Luxembourgish. Most official business is carried out in French. German is very often used in much of the [[Mass media|media]] alongside with French.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2005.lu/fr/savoir_lux/lux_publications/a_propos_langues/a_propos_langues.pdf |title=À propos des langues |accessdate=1 August 2006 |format=PDF |pages=3–4 |publisher=Service Information et Presse |language=fr}}</ref>. French is mostly used for written communications from the authorities to the public.

A 2009 survey pointed out that French was the language spoken by most inhabitants (99%), followed by Luxembourgish (82%), German (81%) and English (72%)<ref>Fernand Fehlen, BaleineBis : une enquête sur un marché linguistique multilingue en profonde mutation. LuxemburgsSprachenmarkt in Wandel, Luxembourg, SESOPI, 2009</ref>. 

Although professional life is largely multilingual, French is described by private sector business leaders as the main working language of their companies (56%), followed by Luxembourgish (20%), English (18%) and German (6%)<ref>Les langues dans les offres d'emploi au Luxembourg (1984-2014), Université du Luxembourg, IPSE Identités, Politiques, Sociétés, Espaces, Working Paper, Juin 2015</ref>.

Due to the large community of Portuguese origin, the Portuguese language is de facto fairly present in Luxembourg though it remains limited to the relationships inside this community; although Portuguese does not have any official status, the administration sometimes holds certain informative documents available in Portuguese.

=== Religion ===
{{Main|Religion in Luxembourg}}
[[File:Notre Dame Cathedral Luxembourg.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg|Notre-Dame Cathedral]], Luxembourg City]]

Luxembourg is a [[secular state]], but the state recognises certain religions as officially mandated religions. This gives the state a hand in religious administration and appointment of clergy, in exchange for which the state pays certain running costs and wages. Currently, religions covered by such arrangements are [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Judaism]], [[Greek Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], [[Lutheranism]], [[Calvinism]], [[Mennonitism]] and [[Islam]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wort.lu/articles/5957651.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522103349/http://www.wort.lu/articles/5957651.html# |archivedate=22 May 2008 |title=D'Wort article (German) |accessdate=24 July 2007 |publisher=www.wort.lu |language=fr |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Since 1980 it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1979/0291104/0291104.pdf#page=2 |title=Mémorial A, 1979, No. 29 |accessdate=1 August 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Service central de législation |language=fr}}</ref> An estimation by the [[The World Factbook|CIA Factbook]] for the year 2000 is that 87% of Luxembourgers are [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], including the grand ducal family, the remaining 13% being made up of [[Protestants]], [[Orthodox Christians]], [[Jews]], Muslims, and those of other or no religion.<ref name="CIA World Factbook">{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/lu.html |title=World Factbook – Luxembourg |accessdate=13 January 2007 |date=19 December 2006 |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}</ref> According to a 2010 [[Pew Research Center]] study 70.4% are Christian, 2.3% Muslim, 26.8% unaffiliated and 0.5% other religions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://features.pewforum.org/grl/population-percentage.php |title=Table: Religious Composition by Country, in Percentages &#124; Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project |publisher=Features.pewforum.org |date=18 December 2012 |accessdate=2 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101080244/http://features.pewforum.org/grl/population-percentage.php |archivedate=1 January 2013 |df=}}</ref>

Luxembourg has been overshadowed by the culture of its neighbours. It retains a number of folk traditions, having been for much of its history a profoundly rural country. There are several notable museums, located mostly in the capital. These include the [[National Museum of History and Art]] (NMHA), the [[Luxembourg City History Museum]], and the new [[Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art]] (Mudam). The [[National Museum of Military History (Luxembourg)|National Museum of Military History (MNHM)]] in Diekirch is especially known for its representations of the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. The city of Luxembourg itself is on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]], on account of the historical importance of its fortifications.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://shanghai.mae.lu/en/The-Grandy-Duchy-of-Luxembourg/Culture |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722155017/http://shanghai.mae.lu/en/The-Grandy-Duchy-of-Luxembourg/Culture |archivedate=22 July 2011 |title=Culture |work=Ministère des Affaires Etrangères, Luxembourg |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}</ref>

The country has produced some internationally known artists, including the painters [[Théo Kerg]], [[Joseph Kutter]] and [[Michel Majerus]], and photographer [[Edward Steichen]], whose ''[[The Family of Man]]'' exhibition has been placed on UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World]] register, and is now permanently housed in [[Clervaux]]. Movie star [[Loretta Young]] was of Luxembourgish descent.

Luxembourg was the first city to be named [[European Capital of Culture]] twice. The first time was in 1995. In 2007, the European Capital of Culture<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mcesr.public.lu/presse/annee_culturelle_2007/portail_luxembourg_2007/Rapport_final_anglais.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503184358/http://www.mcesr.public.lu/presse/annee_culturelle_2007/portail_luxembourg_2007/Rapport_final_anglais.pdf |archivedate=3 May 2011 |title=Luxembourg and Greater Region, European Capital of Culture 2007 |date=June 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}</ref> was to be a cross-border area consisting of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Rheinland-Pfalz and Saarland in Germany, the Walloon Region and the German-speaking part of Belgium, and the [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] area in [[France]]. The event was an attempt to promote mobility and the exchange of ideas, crossing borders physically, psychologically, artistically and emotionally.

Luxembourg was represented at the World [[Expo 2010]] in Shanghai, China, from 1 May to 31 October 2010 with its own pavilion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sepb.gov.cn/english/downloads/Expo2010.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721012004/http://www.sepb.gov.cn/english/downloads/Expo2010.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |title=Environmental Report for Expo 2010 Shanghai China |date=June 2009 |page=85 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.luxembourgforbusiness.lu/sites/default/files/file/Programme%20Luxembourg%20Commercial%20Week%20at%20Expo%202010.pdf |title=Luxembourg pavilion at the World Expo 2010 Shanghai}}</ref> The pavilion was based on the transliteration of the word Luxembourg into Chinese, "Lu Sen Bao", which means "Forest and Fortress". It represented Luxembourg as the "Green Heart in Europe".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2010shanghai.eu/images/stories/eu-pavilions/luxembourg-pavilion/luxembourg.pdf |format=PDF |title=Luxembourg pavilion displays green heart of Europe |publisher=Shanghai Daily |date=12 November 2007 |accessdate=24 December 2011}}</ref>

Unlike most countries in Europe, sport in Luxembourg is not concentrated upon a particular [[national sport]], but encompasses a number of sports, both team and individual. Despite the lack of a central sporting focus, over 100,000 people in Luxembourg, out of a total population of near 500,000–600,000, are licensed members of one sports federation or another.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/T/E/cultural_co-operation/Sport/Monitoring_fulfillment/Anti-Doping_Convention/4.Luxembourg.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040623101906/http://www.coe.int/T/E/cultural_co-operation/Sport/Monitoring_fulfillment/Anti-Doping_Convention/4.Luxembourg.asp |archivedate=23 June 2004 |title=Luxembourg |accessdate=25 November 2006 |year=2003 |publisher=Council of Europe |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}</ref> The largest sports venue in the country is [[d'Coque]], an [[indoor arena]] and Olympic swimming pool in [[Kirchberg, Luxembourg|Kirchberg]], north-eastern Luxembourg City, which has a capacity of 8,300. The arena is used for basketball, handball, gymnastics, and volleyball, including the final of the [[2007 Women's European Volleyball Championship]]. The [[national stadium]] (also the country's largest) is the [[Stade Josy Barthel]], in western Luxembourg City; named after the country's only official Olympic gold medallist, the stadium has a capacity of 8,054.

Luxembourg cuisine reflects its position on the border between the Latin and Germanic worlds, being heavily influenced by the cuisines of neighboring France and Germany. More recently, it has been enriched by its many Italian and Portuguese immigrants.

Most native Luxembourg dishes, consumed as the traditional daily fare, share roots in the country's folk dishes the same as in neighboring [[German cuisine|Germany]].

Luxembourg sells the most alcohol in Europe per capita.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finfacts.ie/Private/bestprice/alcoholdrinkconsumptionpriceseurope.htm |title=World/Global Alcohol/Drink Consumption 2009 |publisher=Finfacts.ie |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> However, the large proportion of alcohol purchased by customers from neighboring countries contributes to the statistically high level of alcohol sales per capita; this level of alcohol sales is thus not representative of the actual alcohol consumption of the Luxembourg population.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |title=Consommation annuelle moyenne d'alcool par habitant, Catholic Ministry of Health |work=sante.gouv.fr |year=2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112184246/https://www.sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/esp2007-obj-01.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy}}</ref>

=== Media ===
The main languages of media in Luxembourg are French and German. The newspaper with the largest circulation is the German-language daily ''[[Luxemburger Wort]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wort.lu |title=Luxemburger Wort |work=Wort.lu |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> Because of the strong multilingualism in Luxembourg, newspapers often alternate articles in French and articles in German, without translation. In addition there are both English and Portuguese radio and national print publications, but accurate audience figures are difficult to gauge since the national media survey by ILRES <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tns-ilres.com/cms/Home |title=TNS ILRES – Home |publisher=Tns-ilres.com |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref> is conducted in French.

Luxembourg is known in Europe for its radio and television stations ([[Radio Luxembourg (French)|Radio Luxembourg]] and [[RTL Group]]). It is also the uplink home of [[SES S.A.|SES]], carrier of major European satellite services for Germany and Britain.

Due to a 1988 law that established a special tax scheme for audiovisual investment, the film and co-production in Luxembourg has grown steadily.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/culture/pays_cine/index.php |title=Luxembourg, a film country |publisher=Eu2005.lu |date=29 December 2004 |accessdate=25 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421235925/http://www.eu2005.lu/en/savoir_lux/culture/pays_cine/index.php |archivedate=21 April 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> There are some 30 registered production companies in Luxembourg.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.filmfund.lu/the-film-fund/mission/index.php |title=Film Fund Luxembourg |publisher=En.filmfund.lu |date= |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cna.public.lu/film/infos-pratiques/index-professionnels/societes-production-studios/index.html |title=Luxembourgish Film Production Companies |publisher=Cna.public.lu |accessdate=2 April 2015}}</ref>

Luxembourg won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2014 in the [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Animated Short Films]] category with ''[[Mr Hublot]]''.

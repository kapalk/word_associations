The island was named ''La Española'' and claimed by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]], which ruled until the early 17th century. Competing claims and settlements by the French led to the western portion of the island being [[Treaty of Ryswick|ceded to France]], which named it ''Saint-Domingue''. [[Sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s, worked by slaves brought from Africa, were established by colonists.

In the midst of the [[French Revolution]] (1789–99), slaves and [[Gens de couleur|free people of color]] revolted in the [[Haitian Revolution]] (1791–1804), culminating in the abolition of slavery and the defeat of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army at the [[Battle of Vertières]].

[[File:Copia de Cacicazgos de la Hispaniola.png|thumb|upright=1.6|The five [[cacique]]doms of Hispaniola at the time of the arrival of Christopher Columbus]]

At the time of European conquest, the island of [[Hispaniola]], of which Haiti occupies the western three-eighths,<ref name="Dardik"/><ref name="Current Affairs"/> was one of many Caribbean islands inhabited by the [[Taíno people|Taíno]] Native Americans, speakers of an [[Arawakan]] language called Taino, which has been preserved in the Haitian Creole language. The Taíno name for the entire island was ''Haiti''. The people had migrated over centuries into the Caribbean islands from South America. Genetic studies show they were related to the [[Yanomami]] of the [[Amazon Basin]]. They also originated in Central and South America. After migrating to Caribbean islands, in the 15th century, the Taíno were pushed into the northeast Caribbean islands by the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]].<ref name="royal"/>

In the Taíno societies of the Caribbean islands, the largest unit of political organization was led by a ''[[cacique]],'' or chief, as the Europeans understood them. The island of Haiti was divided among five Caciquats: the Magua in the north east, the Marien in the north west, the Xaragua in the south west, the Maguana in the center region of Cibao and the Higuey in the south east.<ref>{{cite book|author=Cassá, Roberto |title=Los Indios de Las Antillas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJ-wJ49cNwAC&pg=PA126|year=1992|publisher=Editorial Abya Yala|isbn=978-84-7100-375-1|pages=126–}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|first=Samuel M.|last=Wilson|year=1990|title=Hispaniola: Caribbean Chiefdoms in the Age of Columbus|publisher=University of Alabama Press|page=110|isbn=978-0-8173-0462-1}}</ref> The caciquedoms were tributary kingdoms, with payment consisting of harvests.

Taíno cultural artifacts include [[cave paintings]] in several locations in the country. These have become national symbols of Haiti and tourist attractions. Modern-day [[Léogane]] started as a French colonial town in the southwest, is beside the former capital of the caciquedom of ''Xaragua.''<ref name="royal">{{cite journal|url=http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/ROYAL-01.ANT|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216092556/http://www.millersville.edu/~columbus/data/ant/ROYAL-01.ANT|archivedate= 16 February 2009|title=1492 and Multiculturalism|author=Royal, Robert |journal=The Intercollegiate Review|date=Spring 1992|volume=27|issue=2|pages=3–10}}</ref>

As a gateway to the [[Caribbean]], [[Hispaniola]] became a haven for [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]] during the early colonial period. The western part of the island was settled by French [[buccaneer]]s. Among them was Bertrand d'Ogeron, who succeeded in growing [[tobacco]]. He recruited many French colonial families from [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. European nations were competing for control in the [[New World]], in the [[Caribbean]] as well as in [[North America]]. [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Imperial Spain|Spain]] settled their hostilities on the island, by way of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] of 1697, and divided Hispaniola between them.

France received the western third and subsequently named it [[Saint-Domingue]], the French equivalent of ''[[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]]'', the Spanish colony of [[Hispaniola]] and the name of its patron saint, [[Saint Dominic]].<ref name=firstcolony>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm |title=Dominican Republic – The first colony |accessdate= 19 June 2006 |work=Country Studies |publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; [[Federal Research Division]]}}</ref>

To develop it into sugarcane plantations, the French imported thousands of slaves from [[Africa]]. Sugar was a lucrative [[commodity crop]] throughout the 18th century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of [[New France|French Canada]], a vast territory, had numbered 65,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/QuebecHistory/encyclopedia/ImmigrationHistoryofCanada.htm |title=Immigration History of Canada |publisher=Faculty.marianopolis.edu |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> The whites were vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands of black slaves they had imported to work on their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans. Blacks outnumbered whites by about ten to one.

The French-enacted ''[[Code Noir]]'' ("Black Code"), prepared by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] and ratified by [[Louis XIV]], had established rules on slave treatment and permissible freedoms.

As in its [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana colony]], the [[New France|French colonial]] government allowed some rights to [[free people of color]]: the [[mixed-race]] descendants of European male colonists and African female slaves (and later, mixed-race women). Over time, many were released from slavery. They established a separate [[social class]]. White French [[Creole peoples|Creole]] fathers frequently sent their mixed-race sons to [[France]] for their education. Some men of color were admitted into the military. More of the free people of color lived in the south of the island, near [[Port-au-Prince]], and many intermarried within their community. They frequently worked as artisans and tradesmen, and began to own some property. Some became slave holders. The [[free people of color]] petitioned the [[New France|colonial]] government to expand their rights.

Inspired by the [[French Revolution]] of 1789 and principles of the [[rights of man]], [[free people of color]] and slaves in [[Saint-Domingue]] and the [[French West Indies]] pressed for freedom and more [[civil rights]]. Most important was the revolution of the slaves in Saint-Domingue, starting in the northern plains in 1791, where Africans greatly outnumbered the whites.

In 1792, the [[French First Republic|French]] government sent three commissioners with troops to re-establish control. To build an alliance with the ''[[gens de couleur]]'' and slaves, the French commissioners [[Sonthonax]] and [[Polverel]] abolished slavery in the colony. Six months later, the [[National Convention]], led by [[Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], endorsed [[abolition of slavery timeline|abolition]] and extended it to all the French colonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/291/ |title=Decree of the National Convention of 4 February 1794, Abolishing Slavery in all the Colonies |publisher=Chnm.gmu.edu |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

Political leaders in the [[United States]], which was a new republic itself, reacted with ambivalence, at times providing aid to enable [[Planter (plantation owner)|planters]] to put down the revolt. Later in the revolution, the US provided support to native Haitian military forces, with the goal of reducing French influence in [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/HaitianRev |title=1784–1800 – The United States and the Haitian Revolution |publisher=History.state.gov |accessdate=24 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920081517/http://history.state.gov/milestones/1784-1800/HaitianRev |archivedate=20 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Rivière-Hérard was removed from office by the mulatto hierarchy and replaced with the aged black general [[Philippe Guerrier]], who assumed the presidency on 3 May 1844.

Philippe Guerrier died in April 1845, and was succeeded by General [[Jean-Louis Pierrot]]. Pierrot's most pressing duty as the new president was to check the incursions of the Dominicans, who were harassing the Haitian troops along the borders.<ref name=leger>{{cite book|last=Léger|first=Jacques Nicolas|title=Haiti: Her History and Her Detractors|year=1907|publisher=The Neale Publishing Company|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Haiti:_Her_History_and_Her_Detractors|pages=197–98}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Dominican gunboats were also making depredations on Haiti's coasts.<ref name=leger/>  President Pierrot decided to open a campaign against the Dominicans, whom he considered merely as insurgents.<ref name=leger/> The Haitian offensive of 1845 was stopped on the frontier.<ref name="Bethell">{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=267–69}}</ref>

On 1 January 1846 Pierrot announced a fresh campaign to put down the Dominicans, but his officers and men greeted this fresh summons with contempt.<ref name=Bethell/> Thus, a month later – February 1846 – when Pierrot ordered his troops to march against the Dominican Republic, the Haitian army mutinied, and its soldiers proclaimed his overthrow as president of the republic.<ref name=Bethell/> The war against the Dominicans had become very unpopular in Haiti.

===Second Empire (1849–1859)===

On 27 February 1846, President Riché died after only a few days of power and was replaced by an obscure officer, General [[Faustin Soulouque]]. During the first two years of Soulouque's administration the conspiracies and opposition he faced in retaining power were so manifold that the Dominicans were given a further breathing space in which to continue the re-organization of their country.<ref name=Bethell/> But, when in 1848 France finally recognized the Dominican Republic as a free and independent state and provisionally signed a treaty of peace, friendship, commerce and navigation, Haiti immediately protested, claiming the treaty was an attack upon their own security.<ref name=Bethell/> Soulouque decided to invade the east before the French Government could ratify the treaty.<ref name=Bethell/>

On 21 March 1849, Haitian soldiers attacked the Dominican garrison at [[Las Matas de Farfán|Las Matas]]. The demoralized defenders offered almost no resistance before abandoning their weapons. Soulouque pressed on, capturing [[San Juan Province (Dominican Republic)|San Juan]]. This left only the town of [[Azua, Dominican Republic|Azua]] as the remaining Dominican stronghold between the Haitian army and the capital. On 6 April, Azua fell to 18,000 Haitians and a 5,000-man Dominican counterattack failed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> The way to [[Santo Domingo]] was clear.

Emboldened by the sudden retreat of the Haitian army, the Dominicans had resumed their depredations. Their flotilla went as far as [[Dame-Marie, Grand'Anse|Dame-Marie]], which they plundered and set on fire.<ref name=Jacques/> Soulouque, now self-proclaimed as Emperor Faustin I, decided to start a new campaign against them. In 1855, he invaded the territory of the Dominican Republic. But owing to insufficient preparation, the army was soon in want of victuals and ammunition.<ref name=Jacques/> In spite of the bravery of the soldiers, the Emperor had once more to give up the idea of restoring unity of government in the island.<ref name=Jacques/> After this campaign, Great Britain and France interfered and obtained an armistice on behalf of the Dominicans.<ref name=Jacques/>

The sufferings endured by the soldiers during the campaign of 1855, the losses and sacrifices inflicted on the country without compensation or practical result provoked great discontent.<ref name=Jacques/> In 1858, a revolution began, led by General [[Fabre Geffrard]], Duke of Tabara. In December of that year, Geffrard defeated the Imperial Army and seized control of most of the country. As a result, the Emperor abdicated his throne on 15 January 1859. Refused aid by the French Legation, Faustin was taken into exile aboard a British warship on 22 January 1859. General Geffrard succeeded him as President.

===Early 20th century===

In 1892, the [[German Empire|German government]] supported suppression of the reform movement of [[Anténor Firmin]], and in 1897, the Germans used [[gunboat diplomacy]] to intimidate and then humiliate the Haitian government during the [[Luders Affair]].

In the first decades of the 20th century, Haiti experienced great political instability and was heavily in debt to France, Germany and the United States. Fearing possible foreign intervention, President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. Marines into Haiti in December 1914, just after the outbreak of World War I. They removed $500,000 from the Haitian National Bank, but rather than seize it to help pay the debt, it was removed for safe-keeping in New York, thus giving the United States control of the bank and preventing other powers from doing so. This gave a stable financial base on which to build the economy, and so enable the debt to be repaid.<ref>Office of the Historian, U.S. Government. [https://history.state.gov/milestones/1914-1920/haiti U.S. Invasion and Occupation of Haiti, 1915–34]</ref>

In an expression of the [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], the [[United States occupation of Haiti|United States occupied]] the island in July 1915 after the local assassination of Haiti's president, [[Vilbrun Guillaume Sam]] . The Haitian president had been dragged from the French legation and killed in the street by local insurgents after he had ordered 167 political prisoners killed. The {{USS|Washington|ACR-11|6}}, under Rear Admiral [[William Banks Caperton|Caperton]], arrived in Port-au-Prince in an attempt to restore order and protect U.S. interests. This began a nearly 20-year occupation by U.S. forces. Within days, the Marines had taken control of the capital city and its banks and customs house, which controlled all the finances of the island nation. The Marines declared martial law and severely censored the press. Within weeks, a new pro-U.S. Haitian president, [[Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave]], was installed and a new constitution written that was favorable to the interests of the United States.  The new constitution included a clause that allowed, for the first time, foreign ownership of land in Haiti, which was bitterly opposed by the Haitian legislature and citizenry.

The occupation greatly improved some of Haiti's [[infrastructure]] and centralized power in Port-au-Prince. Infrastructure improvements were particularly impressive: 1700&nbsp;km of roads were made usable, 189 bridges were built, many irrigation canals were rehabilitated, hospitals, schools, and public buildings were constructed, and drinking water was brought to the main cities. Port-au-Prince became the first Caribbean city to have a phone service with automatic dialing. Agricultural education was organized, with a central school of agriculture and 69 farms in the country.{{sfn|Heinl|1996|pp=454–455}} The roads were built using the Hatian's own corvee system that allowed the government/occupying forces to take people from their homes and farms, at gunpoint if necessary, to build roads, bridges, etc.<ref>Danticat, Edwidge (28 July 2015), ''New Yorker Magazine''.</ref>

The U.S. Marines were instilled with a special brand of paternalism towards Haitians. Mary Renda writes that "paternalism was an assertion of authority, superiority, and control expressed in the metaphor of a father's relationship with his children."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Renda|first1=Mary|title=Taking Haiti: Military Occupation and the Culture of U.S. Imperialism 1915–1940|date=2001|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|location=Chapel Hill and London|pages=15}}</ref> During Senate hearings in 1921, the commandant of the Marine Corps reported that, in the 20 months of active unrest, 2,250 Haitians had been killed. However, in a report to the Secretary of the Navy, he reported the death toll as being 3,250.<ref>{{harvnb|Schmidt|1971|p=102}}</ref> Haitian historians have claimed the true number was much higher. One went so far as to say, "the total number of battle victims and casualties of repression and consequences of the war might have reached, by the end of the pacification period, four or five times that – somewhere in the neighborhood of 15,000 persons." This is not supported by most historians outside Haiti.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Farmer |authorlink=Paul Farmer |title=The Uses of Haiti |publisher=Common Courage Press |year=2003 |page=98}}</ref>

This chapter in the two nations' histories reflects the interventionist foreign policy of the United States toward its backwards neighbors in Central America and the Caribbean that is often characterized as "[[gunboat diplomacy]]", or one of many "[[Banana Wars]]" that plagued the region in the early 20th century. [[U.S. Marines]] were stationed in the country until 1934, a period of 19 years, and were finally ordered from the island by Franklin D. Roosevelt as a demonstration of his "Good Neighbor Policy". However, the United States controlled the economy of the island and heavily influenced elections in Haiti up through the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 2013, Haiti called for European nations to pay [[reparations for slavery]] and establish an official commission for the settlement of past wrongdoings.

On 4 October 2016, [[Hurricane Matthew]] made landfall near [[Les Anglais]], making it the worst hurricane to strike the nation since [[Hurricane Cleo]] in 1964. The storm brought deadly winds and rain that left Haiti with a large amount of damage to be repaired. With all of the resources in the country destroyed, Haiti received aid from the United Nations of around US$120 million.  The death total was approximately 3,000. Thousands of people were displaced due to infrastructure damage. Also, the cholera outbreak has been growing since the storm hit Haiti. With additional flooding after the storm, cholera continued to spread beyond the control of officials. The storm also caused damage to hospitals and roads, which created a larger problem in helping victims and moving resources. The devastation and damage that Hurricane Matthew caused were sudden and left Haiti in a state of emergency.

Haiti is on the western part of [[Hispaniola]], the second largest island in the [[Greater Antilles]]. Haiti is the third largest country in the Caribbean behind [[Cuba]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] (the latter shares a {{convert|360|km|mi|0|adj=on}} border with Haiti). Haiti at its closest point is about {{convert|45|nmi|km mi|0}} away from Cuba and comprises the horseshoe-shaped peninsula and because of this, it has a disproportionately long coastline and is second in length ({{convert|1771|km|mi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) behind Cuba in the Greater Antilles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/placesinthenews/archive/2010arch/20100114_haiti.html |title=Geography: Haiti |accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/haiti/htland.htm |title=Geography: Haiti| accessdate=29 September 2014}}</ref>

Haiti is the most mountainous nation in the Caribbean and its terrain consists mainly of them interspersed with small coastal plains and river valleys. The climate is tropical, with some variation depending on altitude. The highest point is [[Pic la Selle]], at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0|}}.<ref name="NgCheong-Lum, Roseline 19"/>

The northern region consists of the ''[[Massif du Nord]]'' (Northern Massif) and the ''[[Plaine du Nord]]'' (Northern Plain). The ''Massif du Nord'' is an extension of the ''Cordillera Central'' in the Dominican Republic. It begins at Haiti's eastern border, north of the [[Guayamouc River]], and extends to the northwest through the northern peninsula. The lowlands of the ''Plaine du Nord'' lie along the northern border with the Dominican Republic, between the ''Massif du Nord'' and the North Atlantic Ocean.

The central region consists of two plains and two sets of mountain ranges. The ''Plateau Central'' (Central Plateau) extends along both sides of the Guayamouc River, south of the ''Massif du Nord''. It runs from the southeast to the northwest. To the southwest of the ''Plateau Central'' are the ''[[Montagnes Noires, Haiti|Montagnes Noires]]'', whose most northwestern part merges with the ''Massif du Nord''. Its westernmost point is known as Cap Carcasse.

The southern region consists of the [[Plaine du Cul-de-Sac]] (the southeast) and the mountainous southern peninsula (also known as the [[Tiburon Peninsula, Haiti|Tiburon Peninsula]]). The Plaine du Cul-de-Sac is a natural depression that harbors the country's saline lakes, such as [[Trou Caïman]] and Haiti's largest lake, [[Étang Saumatre]]. The [[Chaîne de la Selle]] mountain range – an extension of the southern mountain chain of the Dominican Republic (the Sierra de Baoruco) – extends from the Massif de la Selle in the east to the [[Massif de la Hotte]] in the west. This mountain range harbors [[Pic la Selle]], the highest point in Haiti at {{convert|2680|m|ft|0}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elahmad.com/maps/qibla-english.htm?latitude=18.9712&longitude=-72.2845&t=h&zoom=9 |title=Map of Haiti |publisher=Elahmad.com |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=July 2013}}

Haiti's most important valley in terms of crops is the Plaine de l'Artibonite, which is oriented south of the Montagnes Noires. This region supports the country's (also Hispaniola's) longest river, the [[Artibonite River|Riviere l'Artibonite]], which begins in the western region of the Dominican Republic and continues most of its length through central Haiti and onward where it empties into the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]]. The eastern and central region of the island is a large elevated plateau.

Haiti also includes various offshore islands. The island of [[Tortuga (Haiti)|Tortuga]] (Île de la Tortue) is located off the coast of northern Haiti. The [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissement]] of [[Gonâve Island|La Gonâve]] is located on the island of the same name, in the [[Gulf of Gonâve|Golfe de la Gonâve]]. Gonâve Island is moderately populated by rural villagers. [[Île à Vache]] (Cow Island), a lush island with many beautiful sights, is located off the tip of southwestern Haiti. Also part of Haiti are the [[Cayemites]].  [[Navassa Island|La Navasse]] located {{convert|40|nmi|mi km}} west of [[Jérémie]] on the south west [[peninsula]] of Haiti,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/haiti/rock.htm |title=Whose Rock Is It?

===Climate===
Haiti's climate is tropical with some variation depending on altitude. Port-au-Prince ranges in January from an average minimum of {{convert|23|°C|1}} to an average maximum of {{convert|31|°C|1}}; in July, from {{convert|25|–|35|°C|°F}}. The rainfall pattern is varied, with rain heavier in some of the lowlands and the northern and eastern slopes of the mountains. Haiti's dry season occurs from November to January.

Port-au-Prince receives an average annual rainfall of {{convert|1370|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. There are two rainy seasons, April–June and October–November. Haiti is subject to periodic droughts and floods, made more severe by deforestation. Hurricanes are also a menace. In summary, Haiti is generally a hot and humid tropical climate.

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Politics of Haiti}}
{{Further|Foreign relations of Haiti}}

The government of Haiti is a [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] republic, a multiparty system wherein the [[President of Haiti]] is head of state elected directly by popular [[elections in Haiti|elections]].<ref>{{cite web|title=1987 Constitution of the Republic of Haiti|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/constitutions/haiti/haiti1987.html|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=9 July 2011|location=ARTICLE 134|pages=ARTICLE 134}}</ref> The Prime Minister acts as head of government and is appointed by the President, chosen from the majority party in the National Assembly.

Legislative power is vested in both the government and the two chambers of the [[National Assembly of Haiti]]. The government is organized [[unitary state|unitarily]], thus the central government ''delegates'' powers to the departments without a constitutional need for consent. The current structure of Haiti's political system was set forth in the [[Constitution of Haiti]] on 29 March 1987.

Haitian politics have been contentious: since independence, Haiti has suffered 32 coups.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1741707&ps=rs |title=Haiti Starts Over, Once Again |author=Michele Kelemen |publisher=Npr.org |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> Haiti is the only country in the Western Hemisphere to undergo a successful [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolution]], but a long history of oppression by dictators—including [[François Duvalier]] and his son [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]—has markedly affected the nation. France, the United States and other Western countries have repeatedly intervened in Haitian politics since the country's founding, sometimes at the request of one party or another. Along with international financial institutions, they have imposed large quantities of debt. Haiti has so much foreign debt that payments have rivaled the available government budget for social sector spending. There have been criticisms of financial institutions for enforcing trade policies on Haiti, which are considered by some to be detrimental to local industry.<ref name="Bell">{{cite book |last=Bell |first=Beverly |date=2013 |title=Fault Lines: Views across Haiti's Divide |location=Ithaca, NY |publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=30–38 |isbn=978-0-8014-7769-0}}</ref>

According to a 2006 report by the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], there is a strong correlation between corruption and poverty in Haiti. The nation ranked first of ''all'' countries surveyed for of levels of perceived domestic corruption.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transparency.ie/content/2006-corruption-perceptions-index-reinforces-link-between-poverty-and-corruption-and-shows-w |title=2006 Corruption Perceptions Index reinforces link between poverty and corruption |publisher=Transparency International |date=6 November 2006 |accessdate=15 January 2009}}</ref>  The [[International Red Cross]] reports that seven out of ten Haitians live on less than US$2 a day.

This statistic was somewhat disputed in a 2006 article about poverty in the slums of Haiti (written for the Red Cross), wherein ICRC officer Didier Revol wrote, "Such statistical estimations should be looked upon very skeptically because of the fact that the average Haitian and Haitian family has to and does spend a lot more than that daily. The disconnect likely lies in the fact that these are estimates based on surveys conducted by asking individuals what their incomes are; in the Haitian culture it is very unlikely that one will receive a truthful and accurate answer to such a personal question. For various reasons individuals will not tell the truth on such a private matter. For some it is because 'it's none of your business', for others, they will simply exaggerate their poor situation in hopes that some type of financial aide will be gained or rendered to them".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.redcross.int/EN/mag/magazine2006_2/10-11.html |title=Hoping for change in Haiti's Cité-Soleil |publisher=International Red Cross |accessdate=16 February 2010}}</ref>

Jean-Bertrand Aristide was initially denied access to Haiti by Haitian immigration authorities, despite issuing appeals for entrance to his supporters and international observers.

In 2010, the [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD) sent a team of veteran officers to Haiti to assist in the rebuilding of its police force with special training in investigative techniques, strategies to improve the anti-kidnapping personnel and community outreach to build stronger relationships with the public especially among the youth.

In 2012 and 2013, 150 HNP officers received specialized training funded by the US government, which also contributed to the infrastructure and communications support by upgrading radio capacity and constructing new police stations from the most violent-prone neighborhoods of [[Cité Soleil]] and [[Grande Ravine]] in Port-au-Prince to the new northern industrial park at [[Caracol, Nord-Est|Caracol]].<ref name="USAID"/>

=== Haitian penitentiary system ===
[[Port-au-Prince]] [[Prison|penitentiary]] is home to half of Haiti's prisoners. The prison has a capacity of 1,200 [[Detention (imprisonment)|detainees]] but {{as of|2017|November|lc=y}} the penitentiary was obliged to keep 4,359 detainees, a 454% occupancy level.<ref name="auto">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4241466/Haitian-prison-inmates-live-filthy-conditions.html|title=Haitian prison where inmates live in overcrowded and filthy conditions|work=Mail Online|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> This leads to severe consequences for the inmates.

One cell could hold up to 60 inmates which was originally designed for only 18, therefore creating tight and uncomfortable living conditions. The inmates are forced to create makeshift [[hammock]]s from the wall and ceilings. The men are on a 22/ 23 hour lock up in the cells so the risk of diseases is very high.<ref name="auto"/> Unable to receive sufficient funds from the government as Haiti endures severe natural disasters which takes up their attention and resources, such as the 2010 earthquake, has caused deadly cases of [[malnutrition]], combined with the tight living conditions, increases the risk of infectious diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] which has led to 21 deaths in January 2017 alone at the Port-au-Prince penitentiary.<ref name="auto"/>

Haitian law states that once arrested, one must go before a judge within 48 hours; however, this is very rare. In an interview with [[Unreported World]], the prison governor stated that around 529 detainees were never sentenced, there are 3,830 detainees who are in prolonged detained trial detention. Therefore, 80% are not convicted.<ref>{{Citation|last=Unreported World|title=Haiti's prison from hell {{!}} Unreported World|date=30 November 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwE_uUgomd0|accessdate=30 March 2018}}</ref>

Unless families are able to provide the necessary funds for inmates to appear before a judge there is a very slim chance the inmate would have a trial, on average, within 10 years. [[Brian Concannon]], the director of the non-profit Institute for Justice and Democracy in Haiti, claims that without a substantial bribe to persuade judges, prosecutors and lawyers to undergo their case, there is no prospect for a getting a trial for years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/02/20/living-hell-officials-alarmed-by-upsurge-inmates-dying-in-haiti-prisons.html|title=Living hell: Officials alarmed by upsurge of inmates dying in Haiti prisons|date=20 February 2017|work=Fox News|access-date=30 March 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

Families may send food to the penitentiary; however, most inmates depend on the meals served twice a day. Unfortunately, majority of the meals consist on rational supplies of rice, oats or cornmeal. This has led to deadly cases of malnutrition-related ailments such as [[Thiamine deficiency|beriberi]] and [[Anemia|anaemia]]. Prisoners too weak are crammed in the penitentiary infirmary.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39034992|title=Haitian prison rife with malnutrition|date=21 February 2017|work=BBC News|access-date=30 March 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In the confined living spaces for 22/ 23 hours a day, inmates are not provided with latrines and a forced to [[Defecation|defecate]] into plastic bags and leave them outside their cells. These conditions are considered in-humane by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in 2008.<ref name=":1" />

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Haiti}}

Administratively, Haiti is divided into ten [[Departments of Haiti|departments]]. The departments are listed below, with the departmental capital cities in parentheses.

The departments are further divided into 42 [[Arrondissements of Haiti|arrondissement]]s, 145 [[Communes of Haiti|communes]] and 571 [[communal section]]s. These serve as, respectively, second- and third-level administrative divisions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/148647/Creation-de-cinq-nouvelles-communes-par-decret-presidentiel |title=Création de cinq nouvelles communes par décret présidentiel |editor=Olivier, Louis-Joseph |date=14 August 2015 |work=Le Nouvelliste |accessdate=17 March 2016}} {{fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-14858-haiti-politic-5-new-communes-in-haiti.html |title=Haïti – Politique: 5 nouvelles communes en Haïti |date=16 August 2015 |work=Haiti Libre |accessdate=17 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://haiti-reference.com/pages/plan/geographie-et-tourisme/divisions-territoriales/ |title=7300.- Divisions territoriales |date=17 August 2015 |publisher=Haiti-Référence |accessdate=17 March 2016}} {{fr}}</ref>

===Energy===
{{Main|Electricity sector in Haiti}}
In 1925, the city of Jacmel was the first area in the Caribbean to have electricity and was subsequently dubbed the ''City of Light''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/lighting-the-way-forward-in-haiti/article1319729/?service=mobile |title=Lighting the way forward in Haiti |author=Leeder, Jessica |work=The Globe and Mail |year=2012 }}</ref>

Today, Haiti relies heavily on an oil alliance with [[Petrocaribe]] for much of its energy requirements. In recent years, hydroelectric, solar and wind energy have been explored as possible sustainable energy sources.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.clintonfoundation.org/our-work/clinton-foundation-haiti/programs/powering-haiti-clean-energy |title=Powering Haiti with Clean Energy}}</ref>

As of 2017, among all the countries in the Americas, Haiti is producing the least amount of energy. Less than a quarter of the country has electric coverage.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=May 2017|title=The Haiti Sustainable Energy Programme|url=https://postconflict.unep.ch/publications/UNEP_Haiti_sustainable_energy.pdf|journal=UNEP|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Most regions of Haiti that do have energy are powered by generators. These generators are often expensive and produce a lot of pollution. The areas that do get electricity experience power cuts on a daily bases and some areas are limited to 12 hours of electricity a day. Electricity is provided by a small number of independent companies: Sogener, E-power, and Haytrac.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pauyo|first=Jean|date=March 2017|title=Transmitting and Distributing Electricity in Haiti|url=https://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/electricity_grid_pauyo_english.pdf|journal=Copenhagen Consensus Center|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> There is no national electricity grid within the country.<ref name=":02">Matthew Lucky, Katie Auth, Alexander Ochs, et al., Haiti Sustainable Energy Roadmap: Harnessing Domestic Energy Resources to Build an Affordable, Reliable, and Climate-Compatible Electricity System (Washington, DC: Worldwatch Institute, 2014).</ref> The most common source of energy used is wood, along with charcoal.

On 31 October 2018, Evenson Calixte, the General Director of energy regulation (ANARSE) announced the 24 hour electricity project. To meet this objective, 236 Megawatt needs to installed in Port-au-Prince alone, with an additional 75 Megawatt needed in all other regions in the country. Presently only 27,5% of the population has access to electricity; moreover, the national energy agency l'Électricité d'Haïti (Ed'H) is only able to meet 62% of overall electricity demand said Fritz Caillot, the Minister of Public Works, Transportation and Communication (Travaux publics, transport et communication (TPTC)).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vantbefinfo.com/energie-le-projet-delectrification-24-24-presente-aux-citoyens-haitiens/|title=Vant Bèf Info Énergie : le projet d'électrification 24/24 présenté aux Citoyens haïtiens -|date=2018-10-31|work=Vant Bèf Info|access-date=2018-11-04|language=fr-FR}}</ref>

The middle and upper classes live in suburbs, or in the central part of the bigger cities in apartments, where there is urban planning. Many of the houses they live in are like miniature fortresses, located behind walls embedded with metal spikes, barbed wire, broken glass, and sometimes all three. The gates to these houses are barred at night, the house is locked; guard dogs patrol the yard. These houses are often self-sufficient as well. The houses have backup generators, because the electrical grid in Haiti is unreliable. Some even have rooftop reservoirs for water, as the water supply is also unreliable.<ref name=c151222/>

The [[Haitian gourde]] (HTG) is the national currency. The "[[Haitian gourde|Haitian dollar]]" equates to 5 gourdes (''goud''), which is a fixed exchange rate that exists in concept ''only,'' but are commonly used as informal prices.

The vast majority of the business sector and individuals in Haiti will also accept US dollars, though at the outdoor markets gourdes may be preferred. Locals may refer to the USD as "dollar américain" (''dola ameriken'') or "dollar US" (pronounced ''oo-es'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haitihub.com/download/Money-Matters-in-Haiti.pdf |title=All About Money: Gourdes, Dollars and Sense for Work and Life in Haiti|publisher=haitihub.com |accessdate=16 February 2014}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
{{Main|Transport in Haiti}}
[[File:Haiti rail map 1925.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Rail map as of 1925]]

Haiti has two main highways that run from one end of the country to the other. The northern highway, Route Nationale No. 1 (National Highway One), originates in Port-au-Prince, winding through the coastal towns of [[Montrouis]] and [[Gonaïves]], before reaching its terminus at the northern port [[Cap-Haïtien]]. The southern highway, Route Nationale No. 2, links Port-au-Prince with [[Les Cayes]] via [[Léogâne]] and [[Petit-Goâve]].

According to the Washington Post, "Officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Saturday [23 January 2010] that they assessed the damage from the [12 January] quake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and found that many of the roads aren't any worse than they were before because they've always been in poor condition."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/23/AR2010012302113.html |title=Haiti's Bad Roads not Damaged by Quake, Army Engineers Say |author=Hedgpeth, Dana |work=The Washington Post |date=23 January 2010 |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

The port at Port-au-Prince, [[Port international de Port-au-Prince]],  has more registered shipping than any of the other dozen ports in the country. The port's facilities include [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, large [[Berth (moorings)|berth]]s, and [[warehouse]]s, but these facilities are not in good condition. The port is underused, possibly due to the substantially high port fees. The port of [[Saint-Marc]] is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and [[Traffic congestion|congested]] Port-au-Prince, as well as its central location relative to numerous Haitian cities.

During the 2010 earthquake, the Port-au-Prince port suffered widespread damage, impeding aid to the victims. The main pier caved in and fell into the water. One of the main cranes also collapsed in the water. Port access roads were severely damaged as well.

In the past, Haiti used rail transport, however the rail infrastructure was poorly maintained when in use and cost of rehabilitation is beyond the means of the Haitian economy.

===Airports===
[[File:Toussaint Louverture International Airport.jpg|thumb|Toussaint L'Ouverture International Airport]]
{{Main|List of airports in Haiti}}

[[Toussaint Louverture International Airport]], located {{convert|10|km}} North/North East of Port-au-Prince proper in the commune of [[Tabarre]], is the primary transportation hub regarding entry and exit into the country. It has Haiti's main [[jetway]], and along with [[Cap-Haïtien International Airport]] located near the northern city of Cap-Haïtien, handles the vast majority of the country's international flights. Cities such as Jacmel, Jérémie, Les Cayes, and Port-de-Paix have smaller, less accessible airports that are serviced by [[regional airlines]] and private aircraft. Such companies include: [[Caribintair]]  (defunct), [[Sunrise Airways]] and [[Tortug' Air]] (defunct).

In 2013, plans for the development of an international airport on Île-à-Vache were introduced by the Prime Minister.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haitilibre.com/en/news-9270-haiti-tourism-official-launch-of-project-tourist-destination-ile-a-vache.html|title=Haiti – Tourism : Official launch of project "Tourist destination Ile-à-Vache" – HaitiLibre.com : Haiti news 7/7|work=HaitiLibre.com}}</ref>

In Haiti, communications include the radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet. Haiti ranked last among North American countries in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI){{snd}} an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Haiti}}

Haiti faces key challenges in the [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]]
sector:
Notably, access to public services is very low, their quality is inadequate and public institutions remain very weak despite foreign aid and the government's declared intent to strengthen the sector's institutions. Foreign and Haitian [[NGO]]s play an important role in the sector, especially in rural and urban slum areas.

===Racial discrimination===

Under colonial rule, [[Mulatto|Haitian mulattoes]] were generally privileged above the black majority, though they possessed fewer rights than the white population. Following the country's independence, they became the nation's social elite and racially privileged. Numerous leaders throughout Haiti's history have been mulattoes.

===Languages===
The two official languages of Haiti are [[French language|French]] and [[Haitian Creole]]. French is the principal written and administratively authorized language (as well as the main language of the press) and is spoken by 42% of Haitians.<ref>{{cite book|title=La langue française dans le monde 2014|date=2014|publisher=Nathan|isbn=978-2-09-882654-0|url=http://www.francophonie.org/Langue-Francaise-2014/projet/Rapport-OIF-2014.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2015}}</ref><ref>À ce propos, voir l'essai ''Prétendus Créolismes : le couteau dans l'igname'', Jean-Robert Léonidas, Cidihca, Montréal 1995</ref> It is spoken by all educated Haitians, is the medium of instruction in most schools, and is used in the business sector. It is also used in ceremonial events such as weddings, graduations and church Masses. Haiti is one of two independent nations in the Americas (along with Canada) to designate French as an [[official language]]; the other French-speaking areas are all [[French overseas departments and territories|overseas]] ''[[Departments of France|départements]]'', or ''[[Overseas collectivity|collectivités]],'' of France.

{{Culture of Haiti}}

Haiti has a rich and unique cultural identity, consisting of a large blend of traditional customs of French and African, mixed with sizeable contributions from the Spanish and indigenous Taíno cultures.<ref name="Yurnet-Thomas">fdan{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=giQaoQz8N0AC&pg=PA13|title=A Taste of Haiti |author=Yurnet-Thomas, Mirta |pages=13–15 |year=2002 |isbn=978-0781809986 |accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref> The country's customs essentially are a blend of cultural beliefs that derived from the various ethnic groups that inhabited the island of Hispaniola. Haiti's culture is greatly reflected in its paintings, music, and literature. Galleries and museums in the United States and [[France]] have exhibited the works of the better-known artists to have come out of Haiti.<ref name="Haitians">{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Germany-to-Jamaica/Haitians.html |title=Haitians |accessdate=2 September 2014}}</ref>

===Art===

Haitian art is [[Haitian art|distinctive]], particularly through its paintings and sculptures, known for its various artistic expressions.<ref name="Yurnet-Thomas" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://globalfaithinaction.org/haiti-culture-and-sports/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427211956/http://globalfaithinaction.org/haiti-culture-and-sports/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 April 2012 |title=Haiti – Culture And Sports |author=Onofre, Alejandro Guevara |accessdate=2 September 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/haiti/ |title=In Haiti, Art Remains a Solid Cornerstone |author=Legro, Tom |date=11 January 2011}}</ref> Brilliant colors, [[Naïve art|naïve]] perspectives, and sly humor characterize [[Haitian art]]. Frequent subjects in Haitian art include big, delectable foods, lush landscapes, market activities, jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods. Artists frequently paint in fables. People are disguised as animals and animals are transformed into people.

As a result of a deep history and strong African ties, symbols take on great meaning within Haitian society. For example, a rooster often represents Aristide and the red and blue colors of the Haitian flag often represent his Lavalas party. Many artists cluster in 'schools' of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Music and dance===
{{Further|Music of Haiti}}

Haitian music combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled on this Caribbean island. It reflects French, African rhythms, Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of [[Hispaniola]] and minor native [[Taino]] influences. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] ceremonial traditions, [[Rara]] parading music, [[Twoubadou]] ''ballads'', [[mini-jazz]] rock bands, [[Rasin]] movement, [[Haitian hip hop|Hip hop]] kreyòl, [[méringue]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113022326/http://www.afropop.org/radio/radio_program/ID/692/Music%20and%20the%20Story%20of%20Haiti|archivedate= 13 November 2007 |title=Music and the Story of Haiti |publisher=Afropop Worldwide}}</ref> and [[compas]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Haitian literature}}

Haiti has always been a literary nation that has produced poetry, novels, and plays of international recognition. The [[Saint Domingue|French colonial experience]] established the French language as the venue of culture and prestige, and since then it has dominated the literary circles and the literary production. However, since the 18th century there has been a sustained effort to write in [[Haitian Creole]]. The recognition of Creole as an official language has led to an expansion of novels, poems, and plays in Creole.<ref>{{Cite book |last=[http://www.voicesfromhaiti.com/2012/06/meet-dr-marie-jose-nzengou-tayo/ Nzengou-Tayo] |first= Marie-José  |title=Creole and French in Haitian Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4xbGzLuBvWwC&pg=PA153|journal=The Haitian Creole Language: History, Structure, Use, and Education |language=English |publisher=Lexington Books |pages=153–176 |isbn=978-0739172216|date= 2012}}</ref> In 1975,  [[Franketienne]] was the first to break with the French tradition in fiction with the publication of ''Dezafi,'' the first novel written entirely in Haitian Creole.

The January 2010 earthquake, was a major setback for education reform in Haiti as it diverted limited resources to survival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haitiedstories.org/background/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426021641/http://www.haitiedstories.org/background/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 April 2011 |title=Haiti's Lost Children |publisher=Haitiedstories.org |accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref>

Many reformers have advocated the creation of a free, public and universal education system for all primary school-age students in Haiti.

Most people living in Haiti are at high risk for major infectious diseases. Food or [[Waterborne diseases|water-borne]] diseases include bacterial and protozoal [[diarrhea]], [[typhoid fever]] and [[hepatitis]] A and E; common [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]-borne diseases are [[dengue fever]] and [[malaria]]; water-contact diseases include [[leptospirosis]]. Roughly 75% of Haitian households lack running water. Unsafe water, along with inadequate housing and unsanitary living conditions, contributes to the high incidence of infectious diseases. There is a chronic shortage of health care personnel and hospitals lack resources, a situation that became readily apparent after the January 2010 earthquake.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA528274 |title=The Geology of Haiti: An Annotated Bibliography of Haiti's Geology, Geography and Earth Science |author1=Robert Lee Hadden |author2=Steven G.

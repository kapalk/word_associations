==Etymology==
{{main|Name of Switzerland}}
{{anchor|Etymology}}
The English name ''Switzerland'' is a compound containing ''Switzer'', an obsolete term for the [[Swiss people|Swiss]], which was in use during the 16th to 19th centuries.<ref>[[OED]] [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Swiss Online Etymology Dictionary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430171445/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Swiss |date=30 April 2011 }} etymonline.com. Retrieved on 25 June 2009</ref> The English adjective ''Swiss'' is a loan from French ''{{lang|fr|Suisse}}'', also in use since the 16th century. The name ''Switzer'' is from the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] ''{{lang|gsw|Schwiizer}}'', in origin an inhabitant of ''[[Schwyz]]'' and its [[Canton of Schwyz|associated territory]], one of the Waldstätten cantons which formed the nucleus of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]]. The Swiss began to adopt the name for themselves after the [[Swabian War]] of 1499, used alongside the term for "Confederates", ''[[Eidgenosse]]n'' (literally: ''comrades by oath''), used since the 14th century. {{anchor|CH}}The [[Data codes for Switzerland#Country|data code for Switzerland]], CH, is derived from [[Latin]] ''Confoederatio Helvetica'' ({{lang-en|Helvetic Confederation}}).

The toponym ''Schwyz'' itself was first attested in 972, as [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|Suittes}}'', ultimately perhaps related to ''{{lang|goh|swedan}}'' ‘to burn’ (cf. [[Old Norse]] ''svíða'' ‘to singe, burn’), referring to the area of forest that was burned and cleared to build.<ref>[[Adrian Room|Room, Adrian]] (2003) ''Placenames of the World''.

The [[Latin]] name ''Confoederatio Helvetica'' was [[Neologism|neologized]] and introduced gradually after the [[Switzerland as a federal state|formation of the federal state]] in 1848, harking back to the Napoleonic [[Helvetic Republic]], appearing on coins from 1879, inscribed on the [[Federal Palace of Switzerland|Federal Palace]] in 1902 and after 1948 used in the official seal.<ref>[http://hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9827.php Marco Marcacci, Confederatio helvetica (2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927075128/http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D9827.php |date=27 September 2015 }}, Historical Lexicon of Switzerland.</ref> (for example, the [[ISO 4217|ISO banking code]] "CHF" for the [[Swiss franc]], and the country top-level domain ".ch", are both taken from the state's Latin name). ''Helvetica'' is derived from the ''[[Helvetii]]'', a [[Gaulish tribe]] living on the [[Swiss plateau]] before the [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman era]].

''[[Helvetia]]'' appears as a [[national personification]] of the Swiss confederacy in the 17th century with a 1672 play by Johann Caspar Weissenbach.<ref>{{HDS|16440|Helvetia}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main|History of Switzerland}}
Switzerland has existed as a state in its present form since the adoption of the Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848. The precursors of Switzerland established a protective alliance at the end of the 13th century (1291), forming a loose confederation of states which persisted for centuries.

===Early history===
{{Main|Early history of Switzerland|Switzerland in the Roman era}}
The oldest traces of hominid existence in Switzerland date back about 150,000 years.<ref name = Early>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100419174957/http://www.swissworld.org/en/history/prehistory_to_romans/prehistoric_times/ History]. swissworld.org. Retrieved on 27 June 2009</ref> The oldest known farming settlements in Switzerland, which were found at [[Gächlingen]], have been dated to around 5300 BC.<ref name = Early/>

[[File:Theater Kaiseraugst.jpg|thumb|left|Founded in 44 BC by [[Lucius Munatius Plancus]], [[Augusta Raurica]] (near Basel) was the first Roman settlement on the Rhine and is now among the most important archaeological sites in Switzerland.<ref>[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swissinfo.html?siteSect=108&sid=6054935&cKey=1126454871000 Switzerland's Roman heritage comes to life] swissinfo.ch</ref>]]

The earliest known cultural tribes of the area were members of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La Tène culture]]s, named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of [[Lake Neuchâtel]]. La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late [[Iron Age]] from around 450 BC,<ref name = Early/> possibly under some influence from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Swiss region was the [[Helvetii]]. Steadily harassed by the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], in 58 BC the Helvetii decided to abandon the Swiss plateau and migrate to western [[Gallia]], but [[Julius Caesar]]'s armies pursued and defeated them at the [[Battle of Bibracte]], in today's eastern France, forcing the tribe to move back to its original homeland.<ref name = Early/> In 15 BC, [[Tiberius]], who would one day become the second Roman emperor, and his brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], conquered the Alps, integrating them into the [[Roman Empire]]. The area occupied by the Helvetii—the namesakes of the later ''Confoederatio Helvetica''—first became part of Rome's [[Gallia Belgica]] province and then of its [[Germania Superior]] province, while the eastern portion of modern Switzerland was integrated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Raetia]]. Sometime around the start of the Common Era, the Romans maintained a large legionary camp called [[Vindonissa]], now a ruin at the confluence of the [[Aare]] and [[Reuss (river)|Reuss]] rivers, near the town of [[Windisch]], an outskirt of [[Brugg]].

The first and second century AD was an age of prosperity for the population living on the Swiss plateau. Several towns, like [[Aventicum]], [[Iulia Equestris]] and Augusta Raurica, reached a remarkable size, while hundreds of agricultural estates ([[Villae rusticae]]) were founded in the countryside.

Around 260 AD, the fall of the [[Agri Decumates]] territory north of the Rhine transformed today's Switzerland into a frontier land of the Empire. Repeated raids by the [[Alamanni]] tribes provoked the ruin of the Roman towns and economy, forcing the population to find shelter near Roman fortresses, like the [[Castrum Rauracense]] near Augusta Raurica. The Empire built another line of defence at the north border (the so-called Donau-Iller-Rhine-Limes), but at the end of the fourth century the increased Germanic pressure forced the Romans to abandon the linear defence concept, and the Swiss plateau was finally open to the settlement of Germanic tribes.

In the [[Early Middle Ages]], from the end of the 4th century, the western extent of modern-day Switzerland was part of the territory of the [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Kings of the Burgundians]]. The [[Alemanni]] settled the [[Swiss plateau]] in the 5th century and the [[valleys of the Alps]] in the 8th century, forming Alemannia.

Throughout the rest of the 6th, 7th and 8th centuries the Swiss regions continued under Frankish hegemony ([[Merovingians|Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] dynasties). But after its extension under [[Charlemagne]], the [[Frankish Empire]] was divided by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843.<ref name = Early/> The territories of present-day Switzerland became divided into [[Middle Francia]] and [[East Francia]] until they were reunified under the [[Holy Roman Empire]] around 1000&nbsp;AD.<ref name = Early/>

{{Further|Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy|Reformation in Switzerland|Early Modern Switzerland}}
[[File:Bundesbrief.jpg|thumb|The 1291 ''Bundesbrief'' (Federal charter)]]

The Old Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps. The Confederacy, governed by [[Swiss nobility|nobles]] and [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] of various cantons, facilitated management of common interests and ensured peace on the important mountain trade routes. The [[Federal Charter of 1291]] agreed between the [[Medieval commune|rural communes]] of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Schwyz|Schwyz]], and [[Unterwalden]] is considered the confederacy's founding document, even though similar alliances are likely to have existed decades earlier.<ref name=schwabe>Schwabe & Co.: ''Geschichte der Schweiz und der Schweizer'', Schwabe & Co 1986/2004. {{ISBN|3-7965-2067-7}}</ref><ref name=Brief>{{cite web | url = http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/ocea/vaus/infoch/chhist.html | title = A Brief Survey of Swiss History | publisher = admin.ch | accessdate = 22 June 2009 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090626222448/http://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home/reps/ocea/vaus/infoch/chhist.html | archivedate = 26 June 2009 | deadurl = yes | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

[[File:Old Swiss Confederation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|The Old Swiss Confederacy from 1291 (dark green) to the sixteenth century (light green) and its associates (blue). In the other colours are shown the subject territories.]]
By 1353, the three original [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] had joined with the cantons of [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] and [[Canton of Zug|Zug]] and the [[Lucerne]], [[Zürich]] and [[Bern]] city states to form the "Old Confederacy" of eight states that existed until the end of the 15th century. The expansion led to increased power and wealth for the confederation.<ref name = Brief/> By 1460, the confederates controlled most of the territory south and west of the Rhine to the Alps and the Jura mountains, particularly after victories against the Habsburgs ([[Battle of Sempach]], [[Battle of Näfels]]), over [[Charles the Bold]] of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] during the 1470s, and the success of the [[Swiss mercenaries]]. The Swiss victory in the [[Swabian War]] against the [[Swabian League]] of [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]] in 1499 amounted to ''de facto'' independence within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref name = Brief/>

The Old Swiss Confederacy had acquired a reputation of invincibility during these earlier wars, but [[Growth of the Old Swiss Confederacy|expansion of the confederation]] suffered a setback in 1515 with the Swiss defeat in the [[Battle of Marignano]]. This ended the so-called "heroic" epoch of Swiss history.<ref name = Brief/> The success of [[Zwingli]]'s [[Reformation in Switzerland|Reformation]] in some cantons led to inter-cantonal religious conflicts in 1529 and 1531 ([[Wars of Kappel]]). It was not until more than one hundred years after these internal wars that, in 1648, under the [[Peace of Westphalia]], European countries recognised Switzerland's independence from the Holy Roman Empire and its [[neutral country|neutrality]].<ref name = Nationsencyclopedia/><ref name = Nationsonline/>

During the [[Early Modern Switzerland|Early Modern]] period of Swiss history, the growing [[authoritarianism]] of the patriciate families combined with a financial crisis in the wake of the [[Thirty Years' War]] led to the [[Swiss peasant war of 1653]]. In the background to this struggle, the conflict between [[Roman Catholicism in Switzerland|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism in Switzerland|Protestant]] cantons persisted, erupting in further violence at the [[First War of Villmergen]], in 1656, and the [[Toggenburg War]] (or Second War of Villmergen), in 1712.<ref name = Brief/>

===Napoleonic era===
{{Main|Switzerland in the Napoleonic era|Helvetic Republic|Act of Mediation}}

[[File:Acte de Médiation mg 0643.jpg|right|thumb|The Act of Mediation was Napoleon's attempt at a compromise between the [[Ancien Régime]] and a Republic.]]

In 1798, the [[French Revolution|revolutionary French]] government conquered Switzerland and imposed a new unified constitution.<ref name = Brief/> This centralised the government of the country, effectively abolishing the cantons: moreover, [[Mulhouse|Mülhausen]] joined France and the [[Valtellina]] valley became part of the [[Cisalpine Republic]], separating from Switzerland. The new [[regime]], known as the Helvetic Republic, was highly unpopular. It had been imposed by a foreign invading army and destroyed centuries of tradition, making Switzerland nothing more than a French [[satellite state]]. The fierce French suppression of the [[Nidwalden|Nidwalden Revolt]] in September 1798 was an example of the oppressive presence of the [[French Army]] and the local population's resistance to the occupation.

When war broke out between France and its rivals, Russian and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austrian]] forces invaded Switzerland. The Swiss refused to fight alongside the French in the name of the Helvetic Republic. In 1803 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] organised a meeting of the leading Swiss politicians from both sides in Paris. The result was the [[Act of Mediation]] which largely restored Swiss autonomy and introduced a Confederation of 19 cantons.<ref name = Brief/> Henceforth, much of Swiss politics would concern balancing the cantons' tradition of self-rule with the need for a central government.

In 1815 the [[Congress of Vienna]] fully re-established Swiss independence and the European powers agreed to permanently recognise Swiss neutrality.<ref name = Nationsencyclopedia/><ref name = Nationsonline/><ref name = Brief/> Swiss troops still served foreign governments until 1860 when they fought in the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|Siege of Gaeta]]. The treaty also allowed Switzerland to increase its territory, with the admission of the cantons of [[Valais]], [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] and [[Canton of Geneva|Geneva]]. Switzerland's borders have not changed since, except for some minor adjustments.<ref>{{HDS|7841|Swiss border ("Les principales rectifications postérieures à 1815 concernent la vallée des Dappes en 1862 (frontière Vaud-France, env. 7,5 km2), la valle di Lei en 1952 (Grisons-Italie, 0,45 km2), l'Ellhorn en 1955 (colline revendiquée par la Suisse pour des raisons militaires, Grisons-Liechtenstein) et l'enclave allemande du Verenahof dans le canton de Schaffhouse en 1967.")}}. It should be noticed that in [[Lago di Lei|valle di Lei]] Italy got in exchange a territory of the same area.

===Federal state===
{{Main|Restoration and Regeneration (Switzerland)|Switzerland as a federal state}}
[[File:Bern, Federal Palace, 1857.jpg|thumb|The first [[Federal Palace]] in Bern (1857). One of the three cantons presiding over the [[Tagsatzung]] (former legislative and executive council), Bern was chosen as the permanent seat of federal legislative and executive institutions in 1848, in part because of its closeness to the French-speaking area.<ref name=Bundesstadt/>]]
The restoration of power to the patriciate was only temporary. After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes, such as the [[Züriputsch]] of 1839, civil war (the ''[[Sonderbundskrieg]]'') broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the ''Sonderbund'').<ref name = Brief/> The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through [[friendly fire]]. Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland.

The war convinced most Swiss of the need for unity and strength towards its European neighbours. Swiss people from all strata of society, whether Catholic or Protestant, from the liberal or conservative current, realised that the cantons would profit more if their economic and religious interests were merged.

Thus, while the rest of Europe saw [[revolutions of 1848|revolutionary uprisings]], the Swiss drew up a constitution which provided for a [[Swiss Federal Constitution|federal layout]], much of it inspired by the [[United States Constitution|American example]]. This constitution provided for a central authority while leaving the cantons the right to self-government on local issues. Giving credit to those who favoured the power of the cantons (the Sonderbund Kantone), the national assembly was divided between an [[upper house]] (the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]], two representatives per canton) and a [[lower house]] (the [[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]], with representatives elected from across the country). [[Referendum]]s were made mandatory for any amendment of this constitution.<ref name = Nationsonline/> This new constitution also brought a legal end to [[Swiss nobility#Current situation|nobility in Switzerland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diesbach.com/sghcf/n/noblesse.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=22 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192147/http://www.diesbach.com/sghcf/n/noblesse.html |archivedate=3 March 2016  }}</ref>

[[File:Gotthard Eröffnungszug Bellinzona.jpg|thumb|left|Inauguration in 1882 of the [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel]] connecting the southern canton of Ticino, the longest in the world at the time]]
A system of single weights and measures was introduced and in 1850 the [[Swiss franc]] became the Swiss [[single currency]]. Article 11 of the constitution forbade sending troops to serve abroad, with the exception of serving the [[Holy See]], though the Swiss were still obliged to serve [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]] with Swiss Guards present at the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|Siege of Gaeta in 1860]], marking the end of foreign service.

An important clause of the constitution was that it could be re-written completely if this was deemed necessary, thus enabling it to evolve as a whole rather than being modified one amendment at a time.<ref name=HistoiredelaSuisse>''Histoire de la Suisse'', Éditions Fragnière, Fribourg, Switzerland</ref>

This need soon proved itself when the rise in population and the [[Industrial Revolution]] that followed led to calls to modify the constitution accordingly. An early draft was rejected by the population in 1872 but modifications led to its acceptance in 1874.<ref name = Brief/> It introduced the [[Referendum#Switzerland|facultative referendum]] for laws at the federal level. It also established federal responsibility for defence, trade, and legal matters.

In 1891, the constitution was revised with unusually strong elements of [[direct democracy]], which remain unique even today.<ref name = Brief/>

Switzerland was an important base for espionage by both sides in the conflict and often mediated communications between the Axis and Allied powers.<ref name = Stonebooks/>

Switzerland's trade was blockaded by both the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and by the [[Axis Powers|Axis]]. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the [[Third Reich]] varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion and the availability of other trading partners. Concessions reached a peak after a crucial rail link through [[Vichy France]] was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland (together with Liechtenstein) entirely isolated from the wider world by Axis controlled territory. Over the course of the war, Switzerland interned over 300,000 refugees<ref>{{HDS|10374|Asylum}}</ref> and the [[International Red Cross]], based in Geneva, played an important part during the conflict.

During the war, the Swiss Air Force engaged aircraft of both sides, shooting down 11 intruding [[Luftwaffe]] planes in May and June 1940, then forcing down other intruders after a change of policy following threats from Germany. Over 100 Allied bombers and their crews were interned during the war.

Switzerland lies between latitudes [[45th parallel north|45°]] and [[48th parallel north|48° N]], and longitudes [[5th meridian east|5°]] and [[11th meridian east|11° E]]. It contains three basic topographical areas: the [[Swiss Alps]] to the south, the [[Swiss Plateau]] or Central Plateau, and the [[Jura mountains]] on the west. The Alps are a high mountain range running across the central-south of the country, comprising about 60% of the country's total area. The majority of the Swiss population live in the Swiss Plateau. Among the high valleys of the Swiss Alps many glaciers are found, totalling an area of {{convert|1063|km2|mi2}}. From these originate the headwaters of several major rivers, such as the [[Rhine]], [[Inn (river)|Inn]], [[Ticino (river)|Ticino]] and [[Rhône]], which flow in the four cardinal directions into the whole of Europe. The hydrographic network includes several of the largest bodies of freshwater in Central and Western Europe, among which are included [[Lake Geneva]] (also called le Lac Léman in French), [[Lake Constance]] (known as Bodensee in German) and [[Lake Maggiore]]. Switzerland has more than 1500 lakes, and contains 6% of Europe's stock of fresh water. Lakes and glaciers cover about 6% of the national territory. The largest lake is Lake Geneva, in western Switzerland shared with France. The Rhône is both the main source and outflow of Lake Geneva. Lake Constance is the second largest Swiss lake and, like the Lake Geneva, an intermediate step by the Rhine at the border to Austria and Germany. While the Rhône flows into the Mediterranean Sea at the French Camargue region and the Rhine flows into the North Sea at Rotterdam in the Netherlands, about {{convert|1000|km|abbr=off}} apart, both springs are only about {{convert|22|km|abbr=off}} apart from each other in the Swiss Alps.<ref name=Geo/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/regionen/thematische_karten/maps/raum_und_umwelt/naturraum_schweiz.html |title=Map Gallery Switzerland: Physical Geography of Switzerland |publisher=Swiss Federal Statistical Office |location=Neuchâtel, Switzerland |accessdate=12 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013071837/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/en/index/regionen/thematische_karten/maps/raum_und_umwelt/naturraum_schweiz.html |archivedate=13 October 2014  }}</ref>

The section of the [[Bernese Alps]] above the deep glacial [[Lauterbrunnen]] valley, containing 72 waterfalls, is well known for the [[Jungfrau]] ({{convert|4158|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) [[Eiger]] and [[Mönch]], and the many picturesque valleys in the region. In the southeast the long [[Engadin]] Valley, encompassing the [[St. Moritz]] area in canton of [[Graubünden]], is also well known; the highest peak in the neighbouring [[Bernina Alps]] is [[Piz Bernina]] ({{convert|4049|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}).<ref name=Geo/>

The more populous northern part of the country, comprising about 30% of the country's total area, is called the Swiss Plateau. It has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds, or vegetables and fruit fields, but it is still hilly. There are large lakes found here and the biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country.<ref name=Geo/>

Within Switzerland there are two small [[enclave]]s: [[Büsingen]] belongs to Germany, [[Campione d'Italia]] belongs to Italy.<ref>[http://enclaves.webs.com/westerneurope.htm Enclaves of the world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918074336/http://enclaves.webs.com/westerneurope.htm |date=18 September 2009 }} enclaves.webs.com.

===Climate===

[[File:Switzerland Köppen.svg|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger climate classification]] map for Switzerland.]]

The Swiss climate is generally [[temperate climate|temperate]], but can vary greatly between the localities,<ref name=Climate>{{cite web |url=http://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/web/en/climate.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629144859/http://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/web/en/climate.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 June 2007 |title=Swiss Climate |publisher=Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss, Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs FDHA, Swiss Confederation |accessdate=12 October 2014  }}</ref> from glacial conditions on the mountaintops to the often pleasant near [[Mediterranean climate]] at Switzerland's southern tip. There are some valley areas in the southern part of Switzerland where some cold-hardy palm trees are found. Summers tend to be warm and humid at times with periodic rainfall so they are ideal for pastures and grazing. The less humid winters in the mountains may see long intervals of stable conditions for weeks, while the lower lands tend to suffer from [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversion]], during these periods, thus seeing no sun for weeks.

A weather phenomenon known as the [[foehn wind|föhn]] (with an identical effect to the [[chinook wind]]) can occur at all times of the year and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity to the north of the Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but is more efficient if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.
The driest conditions persist in all inner alpine valleys that receive less rain because arriving clouds lose a lot of their content while crossing the mountains before reaching these areas. Large alpine areas such as [[Graubünden]] remain drier than pre-alpine areas and as in the main valley of the [[Valais]] wine grapes are grown there.<ref name=FederalClimateMaps>{{cite web |url=http://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/web/en/climate/climate_today/swiss_climate_maps.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223205106/http://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/web/en/climate/climate_today/swiss_climate_maps.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2010 |title=Swiss climate maps |publisher=Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss, Swiss Federal Department of Home Affairs FDHA, Swiss Confederation |accessdate=12 October 2014  }}</ref>

The wettest conditions persist in the high Alps and in the [[Ticino]] canton which has much sun yet heavy bursts of rain from time to time.<ref name = FederalClimateMaps/> Precipitation tends to be spread moderately throughout the year with a peak in summer. Autumn is the driest season, winter receives less precipitation than summer, yet the weather patterns in Switzerland are not in a stable climate system and can be variable from year to year with no strict and predictable periods.

===Environment===
Switzerland's ecosystems can be particularly fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to [[climate change]].<ref name=Climate/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swissworld.org/en/environment/climate_change/impact_of_climate_change/ |title=Environment: Impact of climate change |publisher=Presence Switzerland, Federal Department of Foreign Affairs |website=swissworld.org |accessdate=12 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115110407/http://www.swissworld.org/en/environment/climate_change/impact_of_climate_change/ |archivedate=15 November 2014  }}</ref> Nevertheless, according to the [[Environmental Performance Index|2014 Environmental Performance Index]], Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on renewable sources of energy ([[hydropower]] and [[geothermal]] energy), and its control of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.<ref>{{cite web |title=2014 Environmental Performance Index |url=http://epi.yale.edu/epi/country-rankings |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140129142747/http://epi.yale.edu/epi/country-rankings |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 January 2014 |publisher=Yale Center for Environmental Law & Policy, Yale University, and Center for International Earth Science Information Network, Columbia University |year=2014 |website=epi.yale.edu/epi |accessdate=12 October 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Bern 104.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Federal Palace]], seat of the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]] and the [[Swiss Federal Council|Federal Council]]]]

The [[Swiss Parliament]] consists of two houses: the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]] which has 46 representatives (two from each canton and one from each [[half-canton]]) who are elected under a system determined by each canton, and the [[National Council of Switzerland|National Council]], which consists of 200 members who are elected under a system of [[proportional representation]], depending on the population of each canton. Members of both houses serve for 4 years and only serve as members of parliament part-time (so-called ''Milizsystem'' or [[citizen legislature]]).<ref name=urlMiliz-Parlamentswissinfo.ch>{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/die-legislative-ist-ein-miliz-parlament/162442|title=Die Legislative ist ein Miliz-Parlament – SWI swissinfo.ch|format=|work=|accessdate=13 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220123831/http://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/die-legislative-ist-ein-miliz-parlament/162442|archivedate=20 December 2016}}</ref> When both houses are in joint session, they are known collectively as the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]]. Through [[referendum]]s, citizens may challenge any law passed by parliament and through [[initiative]]s, introduce amendments to the federal constitution, thus making Switzerland a [[direct democracy]].<ref name=Politics/>

The Federal Council constitutes the federal government, directs the [[Federal administration of Switzerland|federal administration]] and serves as collective [[Head of State]]. It is a collegial body of seven members, elected for a four-year mandate by the Federal Assembly which also exercises [[Regulation|oversight]] over the Council. The [[President of the Swiss Confederation|President of the Confederation]] is elected by the Assembly from among the seven members, traditionally in rotation and for a one-year term; the President chairs the government and assumes representative functions. However, the president is a ''[[primus inter pares]]'' with no additional powers, and remains the head of a department within the administration.<ref name = Politics/>

The Swiss government has been a coalition of the four major political parties since 1959, each party having a number of seats that roughly reflects its share of electorate and representation in the federal parliament.
The classic distribution of 2 CVP/PDC, 2 SPS/PSS, 2 FDP/PRD and 1 SVP/UDC as it stood from 1959 to 2003 was known as the "[[magic formula]]". Following the [[Swiss Federal Council election, 2015|2015 Federal Council elections]], the seven seats in the Federal Council were distributed as follows:
: 1 seat for the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic People's Party (CVP/PDC)]],
: 2 seats for the [[Free Democratic Party of Switzerland|Free Democratic Party (FDP/PRD)]],
: 2 seats for the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party (SPS/PSS)]],
: 2 seats for the [[Swiss People's Party|Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC)]].

The function of the Federal Supreme Court is to hear appeals against rulings of cantonal or federal courts. The judges are elected by the Federal Assembly for six-year terms.<ref name=FederalCourts>{{cite web |title=The federal courts |url=https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/federal-council/political-system-of-switzerland/federal-courts.html |publisher=The Federal Council |location=Berne, Switzerland |accessdate=24 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160714130829/https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/federal-council/political-system-of-switzerland/federal-courts.html |archivedate=14 July 2016  }}</ref>

The 1848 and 1999 Swiss Constitutions define a system of direct democracy (sometimes called half-direct or representative direct democracy because it is aided by the more commonplace institutions of a [[representative democracy]]). The instruments of this system at the federal level, known as popular rights ({{lang-de|Volksrechte}}, {{lang-fr|droits populaires}}, {{lang-it|diritti popolari}}),<ref name=PopularRights>{{HDS|48664|Popular rights|author=Andreas Gross|date=22 April 2015}}</ref> include the right to submit a federal initiative and a referendum, both of which may overturn parliamentary decisions.<ref name = Politics/><ref>{{cite news |author=Kaufmann, Bruno |date=18 May 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435383/How-direct-democracy-makes-Switzerland-a-better-place.html |title=How direct democracy makes Switzerland a better place |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=London, UK |accessdate=9 December 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207063551/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1435383/How-direct-democracy-makes-Switzerland-a-better-place.html |archivedate=7 December 2009  }}</ref>

By calling a federal referendum, a group of citizens may challenge a law passed by parliament, if they gather 50,000 signatures against the law within 100 days. If so, a national vote is scheduled where voters decide by a [[majority|simple majority]] whether to accept or reject the law. Any 8 cantons together can also call a constitutional referendum on a federal law.<ref name = Politics/>

Similarly, the federal ''constitutional initiative'' allows citizens to put a [[constitutional amendment]] to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months.<ref group=note>Since 1999, an initiative can also be in the form of a general proposal to be elaborated by Parliament, but because it is considered less attractive for various reasons, this form of initiative has yet to find any use.</ref> The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference on the ballot in case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a [[double majority]] of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.<ref group=note>That is a majority of 23 cantonal votes, because the result of the popular vote in the six traditional [[half-canton]]s each counts as half the vote of one of the other cantons.</ref><ref name=CHPS/>

<nowiki>*</nowiki><small>These cantons are known as half-cantons.</small>

The cantons are [[federated state]]s, have a permanent constitutional status and, in comparison with the situation in other countries, a high degree of independence. Under the Federal Constitution, all 26 cantons are equal in status, except that 6 (referred to often as the [[Cantons of Switzerland#Half-cantons|half-cantons]]) are represented by only one councillor (instead of two) in the [[Swiss Council of States|Council of States]] and have only half a cantonal vote with respect to the required cantonal majority in [[Voting in Switzerland#Constitutional referendums (Popular initiatives)|referendums on constitutional amendments]]. Each canton has its own constitution, and its own parliament, government, police and courts.<ref name=CHAuthorities/> However, there are considerable differences between the individual cantons, most particularly in terms of population and geographical area. Their populations vary between 16,003 (Appenzell Innerrhoden) and 1,487,969 (Zürich), and their area between {{convert|37|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} (Basel-Stadt) and {{convert|7105|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} ([[Canton of Grisons|Grisons]]).

A large number of international institutions have their seats in Switzerland, in part because of its policy of neutrality. [[Geneva]] is the birthplace of the [[Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]] and, since 2006, hosts the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]]. Even though Switzerland is one of the most recent countries to have joined the United Nations, the [[Palace of Nations]] in Geneva is the second biggest centre for the United Nations after New York, and Switzerland was a founding member and home to the [[League of Nations]].

The [[Swiss Armed Forces]], including the [[Ground Forces|Land Forces]] and the [[Swiss Air Force|Air Force]], are [[Conscription in Switzerland|composed]] mostly of conscripts, male citizens aged from 20 to 34 (in special cases up to 50) years. Being a [[landlocked]] country, Switzerland has no navy; however, on lakes bordering neighbouring countries, armed military patrol boats are used. Swiss citizens are prohibited from serving in foreign armies, except for the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]]s of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], or if they are [[dual citizen]]s of a foreign country and reside there.

The structure of the Swiss militia system stipulates that the soldiers keep their Army issued equipment, including all personal weapons, at home. Some organisations and political parties find this practice controversial.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090301042301/http://www.schutz-vor-waffengewalt.ch/ An initiative to abandon this practice] has been launched on 4 September 2007, and supported by [[Group for a Switzerland without an Army|GSoA]], the [[Green Party of Switzerland]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland]] as well as other organisations which are listed at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090602090451/http://www.schutz-vor-waffengewalt.ch/organisationen.html Tragende und unterstützende Organisationen]. schutz-vor-waffengewalt.ch</ref> Women can serve voluntarily.

Overall, three general mobilisations have been declared to ensure the integrity and neutrality of Switzerland. The first one was held on the occasion of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71. The second was in response to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in August 1914. The third mobilisation of the army took place in September 1939 in response to the [[German attack on Poland]]; [[Henri Guisan]] was elected as the General-in-Chief.

Because of its neutrality policy, the Swiss army does not currently take part in armed conflicts in other countries, but is part of some peacekeeping missions around the world. Since 2000 the armed force department has also maintained the [[Onyx (interception system)|Onyx]] intelligence gathering system to monitor satellite communications.<ref>As context, according to [[Edwin Reischauer]], "To be neutral you must be ready to be highly militarized, like Switzerland or Sweden." – ''see'' Chapin, Emerson.

Following the end of the [[Cold War]] there have been a number of attempts to curb military activity or even abolish the armed forces altogether.

=== The capital or Federal City issue ===
Until 1848 the rather loosely coupled Confederation did not know a central political organisation, but representatives, mayors, and ''Landammänner'' met several times a year at the capital of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|''Lieu'']] presiding the [[Tagsatzung|Confederal Diet]] for one year.

Until 1500 the legates met most of the time in [[Lucerne]], but also in Zürich, [[Baden]], Bern, Schwyz etc., but sometimes also at places outside of the confederation, such as [[Constance]]. From the [[Swabian War]] in 1499 onwards until Reformation, most conferences met in Zurich. Afterwards the town hall at Baden, where the annual accounts of the common people had been held regularly since 1426, became the most frequent, but not the sole place of assembly. After 1712 [[Frauenfeld]] gradually dissolved Baden. From 1526, the Catholic conferences were held mostly in Lucerne, the Protestant conferences from 1528 mostly in [[Aarau]], the one for the legitimation of the French Ambassador in [[Solothurn]]. At the same time the syndicate for the ''Ennetbirgischen Vogteien'' located in the present Ticino met from 1513 in [[Lugano]] and [[Locarno]].<ref name=HDSdiet>{{HDS|10077|Confederal Diet|author=Andreas Würgler|date=25 September 2014}}</ref>

After the [[Helvetic Republic]] and during the [[Act of Mediation|Mediation]] from 1803 until 1815 the Confederal Diet of the 19 ''Lieus'' met at the capitals of the ''directoral cantons'' [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], Berne, [[Canton of Basel-City|Basel]], Zurich, Lucerne and Solothurn.<ref name=HDSdiet/>

After the Long Diet from 6 April 1814 to 31 August 1815 took place in Zurich to replace the constitution and the enhancement of the Confederation to 22 cantons by the admission of the cantons of Valais, Neuchâtel and Geneva to full members, the directoral cantons of Lucerne, Zurich and Berne took over the diet in two-year turns.<ref name=HDSdiet/>

In 1848, the federal constitution provided that details concerning the federal institutions, such as their locations, should be taken care of by the [[Federal Assembly of Switzerland|Federal Assembly]] (BV 1848 Art. 108). Thus on 28 November 1848, the Federal Assembly voted in majority to locate the seat of government in Berne. And, as a prototypical federal compromise, to assign other federal institutions, such as the [[ETH Zurich|Federal Polytechnical School]] (1854, the later ETH) to Zurich, and other institutions to Lucerne, such as the later [[SUVA]] (1912) and the Federal Insurance Court (1917). In 1875, a law (RS 112) fixed the compensations owed by the city of Bern for the federal seat.<ref name=Bundesstadt/> According to these living fundamental federalistic feelings further federal institutions were subsequently attributed to [[Lausanne]] ([[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Federal Supreme Court]] in 1872, and [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] in 1969), [[Bellinzona]] ([[Federal Criminal Court of Switzerland|Federal Criminal Court]], 2004), and [[St. Gallen]] ([[Federal Administrative Court (Switzerland)|Federal Administrative Court]] and [[Federal Patent Court (Switzerland)|Federal Patent Court]], 2012).

The 1999 new constitution, however, does not contain anything concerning any Federal City. In 2002 a tripartite committee has been asked by the Swiss Federal Council to prepare the "creation of a federal law on the status of Bern as a Federal City", and to evaluate the positive and negative aspects for the city and the canton of Bern if this status were awarded. After a first report the work of this committee was suspended in 2004 by the Swiss Federal Council, and work on this subject has not resumed since.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/gesetz/07212/07416/index.html |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010143933/https://www.bk.admin.ch/themen/gesetz/07212/07416/index.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 October 2017 |title=Bundesstadtstatus Stadt Bern |language=de, fr, it |publisher=Swiss Federal Chancellery |date=13 July 2006 |location=Berne, Switzerland |type=official website |accessdate=11 May 2017  }}</ref>

Thus as of today, no city in Switzerland has the official status either of capital or of Federal City, nevertheless Berne is commonly referred to as "Federal City" ({{lang-de|Bundesstadt}}, {{lang-fr|ville fédérale}}, {{lang-it|città federale}}).

In 2018, Switzerland's population slightly exceeded 8.5 million. In common with other developed countries, the Swiss population increased rapidly during the industrial era, quadrupling between 1800 and 1990. Growth has since stabilised, and like most of Europe, Switzerland faces an [[aging population|ageing population]], albeit with consistent annual growth projected into 2035, due mostly to immigration and a fertility rate close to [[Replacement fertility rate|replacement level]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Swiss population to grow 12.5 per cent by 2035|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-population-to-grow-12.5-per-cent-by-2035/29879180|website=SWI|publisher=SWI|accessdate=23 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160725184243/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-population-to-grow-12.5-per-cent-by-2035/29879180|archivedate=25 July 2016}}</ref>

Aside from the official forms of their respective languages, the four linguistic regions of Switzerland also have their local dialectal forms. The role played by dialects in each linguistic region varies dramatically: in the German-speaking regions, [[Swiss German]] dialects have become ever more prevalent since the second half of the 20th century, especially in the media, such as radio and television, and are used as an everyday language for many, while the [[Swiss Standard German|Swiss variety of Standard German]] is almost always used instead of dialect for written communication (c.f.

The principal official languages (German, French, and Italian) have terms, not used outside of Switzerland, known as [[Helvetism]]s. German Helvetisms are, roughly speaking, a large group of words typical of [[Swiss Standard German]], which do not appear either in [[Standard German]], nor in other German dialects. These include terms from Switzerland's surrounding language cultures (German ''Billett''<ref name=billete>{{cite web |url=http://www.sbb.ch/abos-billette/billette-schweiz.html |title=Billette Schweiz. |publisher=SBB CFF FFS Swiss Federal Railways |location=Berne, Switzerland |language=German |accessdate=31 July 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704011118/https://www.sbb.ch/abos-billette/billette-schweiz.html |archivedate=4 July 2015  }}</ref> from French), from similar terms in another language (Italian ''azione'' used not only as ''act'' but also as ''discount'' from German ''Aktion'').<ref name=CHDuden>{{cite book |title=Duden Schweizerhochdeutsch |url=http://www.duden.de/presse/weder-fisch-noch-vogel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121000102/http://www.duden.de/presse/weder-fisch-noch-vogel |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 January 2012 |date=2012 |publisher=Bibliographisches Institut GmbH |location=Berlin, Germany |isbn=978-3-411-70417-0 |language=German |accessdate=31 July 2015  }}</ref> The French spoken in Switzerland has similar terms, which are equally known as Helvetisms.

The country was historically about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities over most of the country. Switzerland [[Reformation in Switzerland|played an exceptional role]] during the [[Reformation]] as it became home to many [[Protestant Reformers|reformers]]. [[Geneva]] converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before [[John Calvin]] arrived there. In 1541, he founded the ''[[Republic of Geneva]]'' on his own ideals. It became known internationally as the ''Protestant Rome'', and housed such reformers as [[Theodore Beza]], [[William Farel]] or [[Pierre Viret]]. [[Zürich]] [[Reformation in Zürich|became]] another stronghold around the same time, with [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[Heinrich Bullinger]] taking the lead there. Anabaptists [[Felix Manz]] and [[Conrad Grebel]] also operated there. They were later joined by the fleeing [[Peter Martyr Vermigli]] and [[Hans Denck]]. Other centres included [[Basel]] ([[Andreas Karlstadt]] and [[Johannes Oecolampadius]]), [[Berne]] ([[Berchtold Haller]] and [[Niklaus Manuel]]), and [[St. Gallen]] ([[Joachim Vadian]]). One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. [[Central Switzerland]], the [[Valais]], the [[Ticino]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden|Appenzell Innerrhodes]], the [[Canton of Jura|Jura]], and [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] are traditionally Catholic. The [[Swiss Constitution]] of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the [[Sonderbundskrieg]], consciously defines a [[consociational state]], allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete [[separation of church and state]] was rejected by 78.9% of the voters.<ref>[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/19800302/index.html Volksabstimmung vom 2.

As the Confederation, from its foundation in 1291, was almost exclusively composed of German-speaking regions, the earliest forms of literature are in German. In the 18th century, French became the fashionable language in Bern and elsewhere, while the influence of the French-speaking allies and subject lands was more marked than before.<ref>From [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]], [[Wikisource:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Switzerland/Literature|Swiss literature]]</ref>

Among the classic authors of Swiss German literature are [[Jeremias Gotthelf]] (1797–1854) and [[Gottfried Keller]] (1819–1890). The undisputed giants of 20th-century Swiss literature are [[Max Frisch]] (1911–91) and [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] (1921–90), whose repertoire includes ''Die Physiker'' ([[The Physicists]]) and ''Das Versprechen'' ([[The Pledge: Requiem for the Detective Novel|The Pledge]]), released in 2001 as a Hollywood film.<ref name=Literature>[http://www.swissworld.org/en/culture/literature/german_speaking_authors/ Literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611004600/http://www.swissworld.org/en/culture/literature/german_speaking_authors/ |date=11 June 2009 }} swissworld.org, Retrieved on 23 June 2009</ref>

Prominent French-speaking writers were [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712–1778) and [[Germaine de Staël]] (1766–1817). More recent authors include [[Charles Ferdinand Ramuz]] (1878–1947), whose novels describe the lives of peasants and mountain dwellers, set in a harsh environment and [[Blaise Cendrars]] (born Frédéric Sauser, 1887–1961).<ref name = Literature/> Also Italian and Romansh-speaking authors contributed but in more modest way given their small number.

Probably the most famous Swiss literary creation, ''[[Heidi]]'', the story of an orphan girl who lives with her grandfather in the Alps, is one of the most popular children's books ever and has come to be a symbol of Switzerland. Her creator, [[Johanna Spyri]] (1827–1901), wrote a number of other books on similar themes.<ref name = Literature/>

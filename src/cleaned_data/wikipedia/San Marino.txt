'''San Marino''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-San Marino.ogg|ˌ|s|æ|n|_|m|ə|ˈ|r|iː|n|oʊ}}, {{IPA-it|san maˈriːno|lang}}), officially the '''Republic of San Marino'''<ref name="cia"/><ref name="Britannica">{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521449/San-Marino |title=San Marino |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2012 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> ({{lang-it|Repubblica di San Marino}}), also known as the '''[[Most Serene Republic]] of San Marino'''<ref name="Britannica"/> ({{lang-it|Serenissima Repubblica di San Marino|links=no}}), is an [[Enclave and exclave|enclaved]] [[microstate]] surrounded by [[Italy]], situated on the [[Italian Peninsula]] on the northeastern side of the [[Apennine Mountains]]. Its size is just over {{convert|61|sqkm|abbr=on}}, with a population of 33,562.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanmarino.sm/on-line/home/san-marino/scheda-paese/informazioni-sulla-popolazione.html |title=Informazioni sulla popolazione – Repubblica di San Marino, portale ufficiale |publisher=Sanmarino.sm |date= |accessdate=11 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112040204/http://www.sanmarino.sm/on-line/home/san-marino/scheda-paese/informazioni-sulla-popolazione.html |archivedate=12 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Its [[capital city|capital]] is the [[City of San Marino]] and its largest settlement is [[Dogana]] in the municipality of [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]]. San Marino has the smallest population of all the members of the [[Council of Europe]]. With [[Italian language|Italian]] being the official language, along with strong financial and ethno-cultural connections, San Marino maintains close ties to its much larger neighbour; it is located close to the [[riviera]] of [[Rimini]], one of Italy's main coastal resort areas.

The country derives its name literally from [[Saint Marinus]], a [[Stonemasonry|stonemason]] originating from the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] colony on the island of [[Rab]], in modern-day [[Croatia]]. In AD 257,{{clarification needed|reason=does the legend really claim that he started working over a 100 years before his death in 366? this site gives that impression http://www.sanmarinosite.com/en/history/origins-of-san-marino/, but, is that an error, from wikipedia, or the actual legend? also, the site is clear with it probably not being correct, which should be made clearer in this article.|date=January 2018}} Marinus, according to legend, participated in the reconstruction of [[Rimini]]'s city walls after their destruction by [[Liburnians|Liburnian]] [[pirates]]. Marinus then went on to found an independent monastic community on [[Monte Titano]] in AD 301; thus, San Marino lays claim to be the oldest extant sovereign state as well as the oldest constitutional [[republic]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Europe's Micro-States: (04) San Marino|url=http://www.dw.de/europes-micro-states-04-san-marino/av-17804426|accessdate=28 July 2014|publisher=Deutsche Welle|date=24 July 2014}}</ref>

San Marino is governed by the [[Constitution of San Marino]] (''Leges Statutae Republicae Sancti Marini''), a series of six books written in [[Latin]] in the late 16th century, that dictate the country's political system, among other matters. The country is considered to have the earliest written governing documents, or constitution, still in effect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/08/jon-huntsman/oldest-surviving-one-document-text/ |title=The United States has "the longest surviving constitution." |publisher=PolitiFact.com |date=|accessdate=26 September 2012}}</ref>

The country's economy mainly relies on [[finance]], [[industry]], [[Service_(economics)|services]] and [[tourism]]. It is among one of the wealthiest countries in the world in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP (per capita)]], with a figure comparable to the most developed European regions. San Marino is considered to have a highly stable economy, with one of the lowest [[unemployment]] rates in Europe, no [[national debt]] and a budget surplus,<ref name="cia">{{CIA World Factbook link|sm|San Marino}}</ref> and has the world's highest rate of car ownership, being the [[List of countries by vehicles per capita|only country with more vehicles than people]].

San Marino is one of the only three countries in the world to be completely surrounded by a single other country (the others being [[Vatican City]], also surrounded by Italy, and [[Lesotho]]). It is the third smallest country in [[Europe]], with only [[Vatican City]] and [[Monaco]] being smaller. It is also the fifth smallest country in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Planet|first1=Lonely|title=San Marino – Lonely Planet|url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/emilia-romagna-and-san-marino/san-marino|website=Lonely Planet|accessdate=18 November 2016}}</ref>

==History==
{{Main article|History of San Marino}}
[[File:Marino als steinhauer.png|thumb|left|Illustration of [[Saint Marinus]], the founder of the Republic of San Marino, and prominent cultural figure]]
[[Saint Marinus]] left the island of [[Rab]] in present-day [[Croatia]] with his lifelong friend Leo, and went to the city of [[Rimini]] as a stonemason. After the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] following his Christian sermons, he escaped to the nearby [[Monte Titano]], where he built a small church and thus founded what is now the city and state of San Marino, which is sometimes still called the "Titanic Republic".<ref>Charles, comte de Bruc, [https://archive.org/details/republicsanmari00brucgoog ''The Republic of San Marino''] (Cambridge: 1880).</ref> 

The official date of the founding of what is now known as the Republic is 3 September 301. In 1320 the community of [[Chiesanuova]] chose to join the country.<ref>[https://www.sanmarinosite.com/en/castles/chiesanuova SanMarinoSite. Chiesanuova.]</ref> In 1463 San Marino was extended with the communities of [[Faetano]], [[Fiorentino]], [[Montegiardino]], and [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]], after which the country's border have remained unchanged.<ref>[https://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/San-Marino.html/ San Marino]. Countries and their Cultures.</ref> In 1631, its independence was recognized by the [[Papacy]].

The advance of [[Napoleon]]'s army in 1797 presented a brief threat to the independence of San Marino, but the country was saved from losing its liberty thanks to one of its Regents, [[Antonio Onofri]], who managed to gain the respect and friendship of Napoleon. Thanks to his intervention, Napoleon, in a letter delivered to [[Gaspard Monge]], scientist and commissary of the French Government for Science and Art, promised to guarantee and protect the independence of the Republic, even offering to extend its territory according to its needs. The offer was declined by the Regents, fearing future retaliation from other states' [[revanchism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanmarinosite.com/eng/napoleone.html |title=From 1500 to beginning 1800, Napoleon in San Marino |publisher=Sanmarinosite.com |date= |accessdate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518123316/http://www.sanmarinosite.com/eng/napoleone.html |archivedate=18 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>''Histoire abrégée des traités de paix entre les puissances de l'Europe depuis la Paix de Westphalie'', Christophe-Guillaume Koch, ed., Paris, 1817, vol.

During the later phase of the [[Italian unification]] process in the 19th century, San Marino served as a refuge for many people persecuted because of their support for unification. In recognition of this support, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] accepted the wish of San Marino not to be incorporated into the new Italian state.

The government of San Marino made [[United States]] President [[Abraham Lincoln]] an honorary citizen. He wrote in reply, saying that the republic proved that "government founded on republican principles is capable of being so administered as to be secure and enduring."<ref name="SanMarinoAbrahamLincoln1">{{cite web

During [[World War I]], when Italy declared war on [[Austria-Hungary]] on 23 May 1915, San Marino remained neutral and Italy adopted a hostile view of Sammarinese neutrality, suspecting that San Marino could harbour Austrian spies who could be given access to its new radiotelegraph station. Italy tried to forcibly establish a detachment of [[Carabinieri]] in the republic and then cut the republic's telephone lines when it did not comply. Two groups of ten volunteers joined Italian forces in the fighting on the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian front]], the first as combatants and the second as a medical corps operating a Red Cross field hospital. The existence of this hospital later caused Austria-Hungary to suspend diplomatic relations with San Marino.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.educazione.sm/scuola/servizi/CD_virtuali/lavori_scuole/sanmarino/prima_guerra_mondiale.htm |title=San Marino e la Prima Guerra Mondiale |publisher=Educazione.sm |date=|accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref>

Following the conclusion of World War I, San Marino suffered from high rates of unemployment and inflation, leading to increased tensions between the lower and middle classes. The latter, fearing that the moderate government of San Marino would make concessions to the lower class majority, began to show support for the [[Sammarinese Fascist Party]] (''Partito Fascista Sammarinese''), founded in 1922 and styled largely off their [[Italian Fascist Party|Italian counterpart]]. PFS rule lasted from 1923 to 1943, and, during this time, they often sought support from [[Benito Mussolini]]'s fascist government in Italy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Valentina |title=World Wars and Fascism in San Marino |url=https://www.sanmarinosite.com/en/history/world-wars-fascism/ |website=Sanmarinosite.com |publisher=San Marino Site Turismo |accessdate=28 February 2019}}</ref>

[[File:Guerra1.JPG|thumb|left|British troops at [[Monte Titano]] during the battle of San Marino, September 1944]]
During [[World War II]], San Marino remained neutral, although it was wrongly reported in an article from ''[[The New York Times]]'' that it had declared war on the [[United Kingdom]] on 17 September 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://209.157.64.200/focus/chat/2591636/posts |title=GALES SCATTER NAZI CHANNEL FLEETS; ITALIANS THRUST DEEPER INTO EGYPT (9/18/40) |publisher=209.157.64.200 |date=18 September 2010 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}</ref>  The Sammarinese government later transmitted a message to the British government stating that they had not declared war on the United Kingdom.<ref name=dp292>[[#refDiplomatic|''Diplomatic papers, 1944'']], p. 292</ref>

Three days after the fall of [[Benito Mussolini]] in Italy, PFS rule collapsed and the new government declared neutrality in the conflict. The Fascists regained power on 1 April 1944 but kept neutrality intact. Despite that, on 26 June 1944, San Marino was bombed by the [[Royal Air Force]], in the belief that San Marino had been overrun by German forces and was being used to amass stores and ammunition. The Sammarinese government declared on the same day that no military installations or equipment were located on its territory, and that no belligerent forces had been allowed to enter.<ref>[[#refDiplomatic|''Diplomatic papers, 1944'']], p. 291</ref> San Marino accepted thousands of civilian refugees when Allied forces went over the [[Gothic Line]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanmarinosite.com/storia/guerremo.html |title=Guerre Mondiali e Fascismo nella storia di San Marino |publisher=Sanmarinosite.com |date= |accessdate=24 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410122359/http://www.sanmarinosite.com/storia/guerremo.html |archivedate=10 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In September 1944, it was briefly occupied by German forces, who were defeated by Allied forces in the [[Battle of San Marino]].

San Marino became a member of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1988 and of the [[United Nations]] in 1992. It is neither a member of the [[European Union]], nor of the [[Eurozone]] although it uses the [[euro]] as its currency.

San Marino is an [[enclave]] (landlocked) surrounded by [[Italy]] in Southern Europe, on the border between the [[Regions of Italy|''regioni'']] of [[Emilia Romagna]] and [[Marche]] and about {{convert|10|km|2|abbr=on}} from the [[Adriatic coast]] at Rimini. Its hilly topography, with no flat ground, is part of the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] mountain range. The highest point in the country, the summit of [[Monte Titano]], is {{nowrap|749 m}} {{nowrap|(2,457 [[foot (length)|ft]])}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. There are no bodies of water of any significant size.

===Climate===
The [[climate]] is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] with continental influences, having warm summers and cool winters that are typical of inland areas of the central Italian peninsula.

[[File:Parliament San Marino.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Pubblico (San Marino)|Palazzo Pubblico]], seat of the government of San Marino]]
[[File:Captains Regent Tomassoni, Rossi, Mancini and Selva.jpg|thumb|Four former Captains Regent: from left to right, [[Mirko Tomassoni]], [[Alessandro Rossi (politician)|Alessandro Rossi]], [[Alessandro Mancini]], and [[Alberto Selva]]]]
San Marino has the political framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]]: the [[captain regent|Captains Regent]] are both [[Head of state|heads of state]] and [[Head of government|heads of government]], and there is a [[Diversity (politics)|pluriform]] [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Grand and General Council]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

San Marino was originally led by the [[Arengo]], initially formed from the heads of each family. In the 13th century, power was given to the Grand and General Council. In 1243, the first two Captains Regent were nominated by the Council. {{As of|2016}}, this method of nomination is still in use.

The legislature of the republic is the Grand and General Council (''Consiglio grande e generale''). The Council is a unicameral legislature with 60 members. There are elections every five years by proportional representation in all nine administrative districts. These districts (townships) correspond to the old [[parish]]es of the republic.

[[Citizen]]s 18 years or older are eligible to vote. Beside general legislation, the Grand and General Council approves the budget and elects the Captains Regent, the State Congress (composed of ten Secretaries with executive power), the Council of Twelve (which forms the [[judicial branch]] during the period of legislature of the Council), the Advising Commissions, and the Government Unions. The council also has the power to ratify treaties with other countries. The council is divided into five different Advising Commissions consisting of fifteen councillors who examine, propose, and discuss the implementation of new laws that are on their way to being presented on the floor of the council.

Every six months, the council elects two Captains Regent to be the heads of state. The Regents are chosen from opposing parties so that there is a balance of power. They serve a six-month term. The investiture of the Captains Regent takes place on 1 April and 1 October in every year. Once this term is over, citizens have three days in which to file complaints about the Captains' activities. If they warrant it, judicial proceedings against the ex-head(s) of state can be initiated.

The practice of having two heads of state, like Roman consuls, chosen in frequent elections, is derived directly from the customs of the [[Roman Republic]]. The Council is equivalent to the [[Roman Senate]]; the Captains Regent, to the [[consul]]s of ancient [[Rome]]. It is thought the inhabitants of the area came together as Roman rule collapsed to form a rudimentary government for their own protection from foreign rule.

San Marino is a multi-party democratic republic. A new election law in 2008 raised the threshold for small parties entering Parliament, causing political parties to organise themselves into two alliances: the right-wing [[Pact for San Marino]], led by the [[San Marinese Christian Democratic Party]]; and the left-wing [[Reforms and Freedom]], led by the [[Party of Socialists and Democrats]], a merger of the [[Socialist Party of San Marino]] and the former communist [[Party of Democrats]]. The [[Sammarinese general election, 2008|2008 general election]] was won by the Pact for San Marino with 35 seats in the Grand and General Council against Reforms and Freedom's 25.

On 1 October 2007, [[Mirko Tomassoni]] was elected as among the heads of state, making him the first disabled person ever to have been elected as [[Captains Regent|captain regent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/esteri/disabile-san-marino/disabile-san-marino/disabile-san-marino.html |title=San Marino, primo capo di Stato disabile "Via tutte le barriere architettoniche" – esteri |publisher=Repubblica.it |date=1 October 2007 |accessdate=24 October 2009}}</ref>

San Marino has had more [[List of elected or appointed female heads of state|female heads of state]] than any other country: 15 as of October 2014, including three who served twice. With regard to the legal profession, while the Order of Lawyers and Notaries of the Republic of San Marino [Ordine degli Avvocati e Notai della Repubblica di San Marino] exists, there is no clear indication as to how demographic groups have fared in the legal field. 

===Administrative divisions===

====Municipalities====
[[File:San Marino.png|thumb|[[Administrative division]]s of San Marino]]
San Marino is divided into the following nine [[municipalities]], known locally as ''{{lang|it|castelli}}'' (meaning "castles"):
* [[City of San Marino|San Marino]] (City of San Marino, officially ''{{lang|it|Città di San Marino}}'') is the capital.

There are also eight minor municipalities:
* [[Acquaviva (San Marino)|Acquaviva]]
* [[Borgo Maggiore]]
* [[Chiesanuova]]
* [[Domagnano]]
* [[Faetano]]
* [[Fiorentino]]
* [[Montegiardino]]
* [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]]

The largest settlement of the Republic is [[Dogana]], which is not an autonomous ''{{lang|it|castello}}'', but rather belongs to the Castello of [[Serravalle (San Marino)|Serravalle]].

===Military===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
{{Main article|Military of San Marino}}

San Marino's military forces are among the smallest in the world. National defence is, by arrangement, the responsibility of [[Military of Italy|Italy's armed forces]]. Different branches have varied functions, including: performing ceremonial duties; patrolling borders; mounting guard at government buildings; and assisting police in major criminal cases. The [[Civil Police (San Marino)|police]] are not included in the military of San Marino.

====Crossbow Corps====
Once at the heart of San Marino's army, the Crossbow Corps is now a ceremonial force of approximately 80 volunteers. Since 1295, the Crossbow Corps has provided demonstrations of [[crossbow]] shooting at festivals. Its uniform design is medieval. While still a statutory military unit, the Crossbow Corps has no military function today.

====Guard of the Rock====
[[File:Guardia di Rocca al Palazzo Pubblico San Marino.jpg|thumb|[[Guardia di Rocca|Guards of the Rock]]]]
The [[Guardia di Rocca|Guard of the Rock]] is a front-line military unit in the San Marino armed forces, a state border patrol, with responsibility for patrolling borders and defending them. In their role as Fortress Guards they are responsible for guarding the Palazzo Pubblico in [[San Marino, San Marino|San Marino City]], the seat of national government.

In this role they are the forces most visible to tourists, and are known for their colourful ceremony of [[Changing the Guard]]. Under the 1987 statute the Guard of the Rock are all enrolled as "Criminal Police Officers" (in addition to their military role) and assist the police in investigating major crime. The uniform of the Guard of the Rock is a distinctive red and green.

====Guard of the Grand and General Council====
The Guard of the Grand and General Council commonly known as The Guard of the Council or locally as the "Guard of Nobles", formed in 1740, is a volunteer unit with ceremonial duties. Due to its striking blue, white, and gold uniform, it is perhaps the best-known part of the Sammarinese military, and appears on countless postcard views of the republic. The functions of the Guard of the Council are to protect the [[Captains Regent]]s, and to defend the Grand and General Council during its formal sessions. They also act as ceremonial bodyguards to government officials at both state and church festivals.

====Company of Uniformed Militia====
In former times, all families with two or more adult male members were required to enroll half of them in the Company of Uniformed Militia. This unit remains the basic fighting force of the armed forces of San Marino, but is largely ceremonial. It is a matter of civic pride for many Sammarinese to belong to the force, and all citizens with at least six years residence in the republic are entitled to enroll.

The uniform is dark blue, with a [[kepi]] bearing a blue and white plume. The ceremonial form of the uniform includes a white cross-strap, and white and blue sash, white epaulets, and white decorated cuffs.

====Military Ensemble====
Formally this is part of the Army Militia, and is the ceremonial military band of San Marino. It consists of approximately 50 musicians. The uniform is similar to that of the Army Militia. Military Ensemble music accompanies most state occasions in the republic.

====Gendarmerie====
Established in 1842, the [[Corps of Gendarmerie of San Marino|Gendarmerie]] of San Marino is a militarised law enforcement agency. Its members are full-time and have responsibility for the protection of citizens and property, and the preservation of law and order.

The entire military corps of San Marino depends upon the co-operation of full-time forces and their retained (volunteer) colleagues, known as the ''Corpi Militari Volontari'', or Voluntary Military Force.

==Economy==
{{Main article|Economy of San Marino|Sammarinese euro coins|List of banks in San Marino}}
[[File:Via Basilicus din San Marino2.jpg|right|upright=1.15|thumb|Tourism and banking are the country's main source of revenue.]]

Although San Marino is not a [[European Union]] member, it is allowed to use the [[euro]] as its currency by arrangement with the [[Council of the European Union]]; it is also granted the right to use its own designs on the national side of the [[euro coins]]. Before the euro, the [[Sammarinese lira]] was pegged to, and exchangeable with, the [[Italian lira]]. The small number of [[Sammarinese euro coins]], as was the case with the lira before it, are primarily of interest to [[coin collecting|coin collectors]].

San Marino's per capita GDP and standard of living are comparable to that of [[Italy]]. Key industries include [[bank]]ing, [[electronics]], and [[ceramic]]s. The main [[agriculture|agricultural]] products are [[wine]] and [[cheese]]. San Marino imports mainly staple goods from Italy.

San Marino's [[postage stamp]]s, which are valid for mail posted in the country, are mostly sold to [[philately|philatelists]] and are an important source of income. San Marino is a member of the [[Small European Postal Administration Cooperation]].

===Taxation===
The corporate profits tax rate in San Marino is 19%. Capital gains are subject to a five per cent tax; interest is subject to a 13% [[withholding tax]].

In 1972, a [[value-added tax]] (VAT) system was introduced in Italy, and was applied in San Marino, in accordance with the 1939 friendship treaty. In addition, a tax on imported goods, to be levied by San Marino, was established. Such taxes, however, were not, and are not, applied to national products. Until 1996, goods manufactured and sold in San Marino were not subject to indirect taxation.

Under the [[European Union Customs Union|European Union customs agreement]], San Marino continues to levy taxes, the equivalent of an import duty, on imported goods. Also, a general VAT was introduced, in replacement of the Italian VAT.

===Tourism===
{{Main article|Tourism in San Marino}}
The [[tourism]] sector contributes over 22% of San Marino's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]],<ref name="rtv">{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmarinortv.sm/economia/default.asp?id=33&id_n=39203|title=Turismo: San Marino fa i conti con la recessione economica, l'Italia guarda con fiducia al 2010|date=11 January 2010|publisher=San Marino RTV |language=Italian|accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref> with approximately 2 million tourists having visited in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tourists flows|url=http://www.statistica.sm/contents/instance15/files/document/14079659Tav_Afflusso_tur.pdf|website=statistica.sm|publisher=Statistical Office of San Marino|accessdate=16 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082104/http://www.statistica.sm/contents/instance15/files/document/14079659Tav_Afflusso_tur.pdf|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===Conventions with Italy===
San Marino and Italy have engaged in conventions since 1862,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/home/trattati-internazionali/convenzioni-bilaterali/convenzioni-bilaterali---accordi-bilaterali-con-litalia.html|title=Convenzioni Bilaterali – Accordi bilaterali con l'Italia|publisher=Segreteria di stato per gli affari esteri e politici|language=Italian|accessdate=28 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104183908/http://www.esteri.sm/on-line/home/trattati-internazionali/convenzioni-bilaterali/convenzioni-bilaterali---accordi-bilaterali-con-litalia.html|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> dictating some economic activities in San Marino's territory.
Cultivation of tobacco and production of goods which are subject to Italy's [[government monopoly]] are forbidden in San Marino. Direct import is forbidden: all goods coming from a third party have to travel through Italy before reaching the country. Although it is allowed to print its own postal stamps, San Marino is not allowed to coin its own currency and is obliged to use [[Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato|Italy's mint]]. Gambling is legal and regulated; however, casinos were outlawed prior to 2007. There is currently one legally operating casino.

In exchange for these limitations, Italy provides San Marino with an annual stipend, and at cost, sea salt (not more than 250 tonnes per year), tobacco (40 tonnes), cigarettes (20 tonnes) and matches (unlimited amount).<ref name="esteri1980">{{cite web|url=http://www.esteri.it/MAE/normative/Normativa_Consolare/ServiziConsolari/Servizio_Militare/san_marino_1980.pdf|title=Convenzione di amicizia e buon vicinato 1939 (1980 transcript)|year=1980|language=Italian|accessdate=28 December 2012|archiveurl=http://www.esteri.it/MAE/normative/Normativa_Consolare/ServiziConsolari/Servizio_Militare/san_marino_1980.pdf|archivedate=3 May 2016}}</ref>

At the border there are no formalities with Italy.  However, at the tourist office visitors can purchase officially cancelled souvenir stamps for their [[passport]]s.

== Population ==

=== Religion ===
{{main article|Religion in San Marino}}
[[File:San Marino katedra.jpg|thumb|right|[[San Marino Cathedral]]]]
San Marino is a predominantly Catholic state<ref name="cia"/>—over 97% of the population profess the Roman Catholic faith, but Catholicism is not an [[established religion]]. Approximately half of those who profess to be Catholic practice the faith.<ref name="Cavendish">{{cite book|title=World and Its Peoples|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcYVmUyHG2AC&pg=PA856|year=2009 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=0-7614-7893-0|page=856}}</ref> There is no [[episcopal see]] in San Marino, although its name is part of the present diocesan title. Historically, the various parishes in San Marino were divided between two Italian [[diocese]]s, mostly in the [[Diocese of Montefeltro]], and partly in the [[Diocese of Rimini]]. In 1977, the border between [[Montefeltro]] and [[Rimini]] was readjusted so that all of San Marino fell within the diocese of Montefeltro. The [[bishop of Montefeltro-San Marino]] resides in [[Pennabilli]], in Italy's province of [[Pesaro e Urbino]].

However, there is a provision under the income tax rules that the taxpayers have the right to request for allocation of 0.3% of their income tax to the Catholic Church or to "other" charities. The churches include the two religious groups of the [[Waldensian Church]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro]] was until 1977 the historic diocese of Montefeltro. It is a [[suffragan]] of the [[archdiocese of Ravenna-Cervia]].<ref>{{Catholic-hierarchy|diocese|dsmmi|Diocese of San Marino-Montefeltro|21 January 2015}}</ref> The current diocese includes all the [[parish]]es of San Marino. The earliest mention of [[Montefeltro]], as ''Mona Feretri'', is in the diplomas by which [[Charlemagne]] confirmed the [[donation of Pepin]]. The first known bishop of Montefeltro was Agatho (826), whose residence was at [[San Leo]]. Under Bishop Flaminios Dondi (1724) the see was again transferred to San Leo, but later it returned to Pennabilli. The historic diocese was a suffragan of the [[archdiocese of Urbino]].<ref name="newadvent.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10528a.htm|title=Diocese of Montefeltro|last=Knight|first=Kevin|year=2009|publisher=newadvent.org|accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> Since 1988, there is formally an [[apostolic nunciature]] to the republic, but it is vested in the nuncio to Italy.

==Transport==
{{Main article|Transport in San Marino}}
There are {{convert|220|km|abbr=on}} of roads in the country, the main road being the [[San Marino Highway]]. Authorities license private vehicles with distinctive [[Vehicle registration plates of San Marino|Sammarinese license plates]], which are white with blue figures and the coat of arms, usually a letter followed by up to four numbers. Many vehicles also carry the international vehicle identification code (in black on a white oval sticker), which is "RSM".

There are no public airports in San Marino, but there is a small private [[Torraccia airfield|airstrip located in Torraccia]] and an international heliport located in [[Borgo Maggiore]]. Most tourists who arrive by air land at [[Federico Fellini International Airport]] close to the city of [[Rimini]], then make the transfer by bus.

Two rivers flow through San Marino, but there is no major water transport, and no port or harbour.

===Public transport===
San Marino has limited public transport facilities. There is a regular bus service between Rimini and the city of San Marino that is popular with both tourists and workers commuting to San Marino from Italy. This service stops at approximately 20 locations in Rimini and within San Marino, with its two terminus stops at [[Rimini railway station]] and San Marino coach station.

A limited licensed taxi service operates nationwide. There are seven licensed taxi companies operating in the republic,<ref>Licensed taxi companies are listed on the {{cite web |url=http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=114 |title=Government tourism website |accessdate=2007-09-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100501005409/http://www.visitsanmarino.com/default.asp?id=114 |archivedate=1 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and Italian taxis regularly operate within San Marino when carrying passengers picked up in Italian territory.

[[File:San-Marino-Gondola-1283.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial tramway to [[Monte Titano]]]]
There is a {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on}} aerial tramway connecting the [[City of San Marino]] on top of [[Monte Titano]] with [[Borgo Maggiore]], a major town in the republic, with the second largest population of any Sammarinese settlement. From here a further connection is available to the nation's largest settlement, [[Dogana, San Marino|Dogana]], via the local bus service.

Two aerial tramway cars (gondolas) operate, with service provided at roughly 15-minute intervals throughout the day. A third vehicle is available on the system, a service car for the use of engineers maintaining the tramway.

===Railway===
Today, there is no railway in San Marino, but for a short period before [[World War II]], it had a single narrow-gauge line called the [[Ferrovia Rimini–San Marino]] which connected the country with the Italian rail network at Rimini. Because of the difficulties in accessing the capital, City of San Marino, with its mountain-top location, the terminus station was planned to be located in the village of [[Valdragone]], but was extended to reach the capital through a steep and winding track comprising many tunnels. The railway was opened on 12 June 1932.<ref>[http://ifef.free.fr/provo/if2005-6.pdf ''Internacia Fervojisto''] (''International Railways''), 2005.6, p. 85. In Esperanto</ref>
An advanced system for its time, it was an electric railway, powered from overhead cables. It was well built and had a high frequency of passengers, but was almost completely destroyed during World War II. Many facilities such as bridges, tunnels, and stations remain visible today, and some have been converted to parks, public footpaths, or traffic routes.

==Culture==
{{Culture of San Marino}}
[[File:Pompeo batoni san marino risolleva la repubblica by stefano bolognini.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|A painting in the Museo di Stato di San Marino by [[Pompeo Batoni]]]]
The [[Three Towers of San Marino]] are located on the three peaks of [[Monte Titano]] in the capital. They are depicted on both the [[Flag of San Marino]] and its [[Coat of Arms of San Marino|coat of arms]]. The three towers are: ''[[Guaita]]'', the oldest of the three (it was constructed in the 11th century); the 13th-century ''[[Cesta]]'', located on the highest of Monte Titano's summits; and the 14th-century ''[[Montale (San Marino)|Montale]]'', on the smallest of Monte Titano's summits, still privately owned.

The cuisine of San Marino is extremely similar to [[Italian cuisine|Italian]], especially that of the adjoining [[Emilia-Romagna]] and [[Marche]] regions, but it has a number of its own unique dishes and products. Its best known is probably the ''[[Torta Tre Monti]]'' ("Cake of the Three Mountains" or "Cake of the Three Towers"), a wafer layered cake covered in chocolate depicting the [[Three Towers of San Marino]]. The country also has a small [[Sammarinese wine|wine]] industry.

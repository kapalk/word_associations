'''Mozambique''' ({{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|z|æ|m|ˈ|b|iː|k}}), officially the '''Republic of Mozambique''' ({{lang-pt|Moçambique}} or ''{{lang|pt|República de Moçambique}}'', {{IPA-pt|ʁɛˈpuβlikɐ ðɨ musɐ̃ˈbikɨ|pron}}, {{lang-ny|Mozambiki}}, {{lang-sw|Msumbiji}}, {{lang-ts|Muzambhiki}}), is a country located in [[Southeast Africa]] bordered by the [[Indian Ocean]] to the east, [[Tanzania]] to the north, [[Malawi]] and [[Zambia]] to the northwest, [[Zimbabwe]] to the west, and [[Eswatini|Eswatini (Swaziland)]] and [[South Africa]] to the southwest. The [[sovereign state]] is separated from the [[Comoros]], [[Mayotte]] and [[Madagascar]] by the [[Mozambique Channel]] to the east. The capital of Mozambique is [[Maputo]] (formerly known as "Lourenço Marques" from 1876 to 1976) while [[Matola]] is the largest city, being a suburb of Maputo.

Between the first and fifth centuries AD, [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west. Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean. Between the 7th and 11th centuries, a series of Swahili port towns developed here, which contributed to the development of a distinct [[Swahili culture]] and [[Swahili language|language]]. In the late medieval period, these towns were frequented by traders from Somalia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and India.<ref>Newitt, M.D.D. "A Short History of Mozambique." Oxford University Press, 2017</ref>

The voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1498 marked the arrival of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], who began a gradual process of colonisation and settlement in 1505. After over four centuries of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Portuguese rule]], Mozambique [[Mozambican War of Independence|gained independence]] in 1975, becoming the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]] shortly thereafter. After only two years of independence, the country descended into an intense and protracted [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] lasting from 1977 to 1992. In 1994, Mozambique held its first multiparty elections, and has since remained a relatively stable [[presidential republic]], although it still faces a [[RENAMO insurgency (2013–present)|low-intensity insurgency]].<ref name=":02">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/19787524/Provincial_Autonomy_The_Territorial_Dimension_of_Peace_in_Mozambique|title=Provincial Autonomy: The Territorial Dimension of Peace in Mozambique|first=Natália Bueno|last=Schenoni|date=|work=academia.edu}}</ref>

Mozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources. The country's economy is based largely on agriculture, but industry is growing, mainly food and beverages, chemical manufacturing and aluminium and petroleum production. The tourism sector is also expanding. South Africa is Mozambique's main trading partner and source of [[foreign direct investment]], while [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]] are also among the country's most important economic partners. Since 2001, Mozambique's annual average GDP growth has been among the world's highest. However, the country is still one of the poorest and most [[Developing country|underdeveloped countries]] in the world,<ref>[http://www.ifad.org/operations/projects/regions/Pf/factsheets/mozambique_e.pdf Investing in rural people in Mozambique] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427212809/http://ifad.org/operations/projects/regions/Pf/factsheets/mozambique_e.pdf |date=27 April 2015 }}. ifad.org</ref> ranking low in [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]], [[List of countries by Human Development Index|human development]], measures of [[List of countries by inequality-adjusted HDI|inequality]] and average [[life expectancy]].<ref name=CIA/>

The only official language of Mozambique is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], which is spoken mostly as a second language by about half the population. Common native languages include [[Makhuwa language|Makhuwa]], [[Sena language|Sena]], and [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. The country's population of around {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Mozambique}}|R}}/1e6 round 0}} million is composed overwhelmingly of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu people]]. The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity, with significant minorities following Islam and African traditional religions. Mozambique is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Southern African Development Community]], and is an observer at [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]].

==Etymology==<!--linked-->
The country was named Moçambique by the Portuguese after the [[Island of Mozambique]], derived from ''[[Mussa Bin Bique]]'' or ''Musa Al Big'' or ''Mossa Al Bique'' or ''Mussa Ben Mbiki'' or ''Mussa Ibn Malik'', an [[Arab]] trader who first visited the island and later lived there.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100630040028/http://www.ilhademo.net/history.html History]. ilhademo.net</ref> The island-town was the capital of the Portuguese colony until 1898, when it was moved south to Lourenço Marques (now [[Maputo]]).

===Bantu migrations===
{{Further|Bantu expansion}}

Between the 1st and 5th centuries AD, waves of [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people migrated from the west and north through the [[Zambezi River]] valley and then gradually into the plateau and coastal areas.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> They established agricultural communities or societies based on herding cattle. They brought with them the technology for smelting and smithing iron.

===Swahili Coast===
[[File:Slaves ruvuma.jpg|thumb|[[Arab slave trade|Arab-Swahili slave traders]] and their captives on the [[Ruvuma River]]]]
From the late first millennium AD, vast [[Indian Ocean trade]] networks extended as far south into Mozambique as evidenced by the ancient port town of [[Chibuene]].<ref name="Sinclair2">{{cite journal|last1=Sinclair|first1=Paul|last2=Ekblom|first2=Anneli|last3=Wood|first3=Marilee|title=Trade and Society on the Southeast African Coast in the Later First Millennium AD: the Case of Chibuene|journal=Antiquity|date=2012|volume=86}}</ref> Beginning in the 9th century, a growing involvement in Indian Ocean trade led to the development of numerous port towns along the entire East African coast, including modern day Mozambique. Largely autonomous, these towns broadly participated in the incipient [[Swahili culture]]. Islam was often adopted by urban elites, facilitating trade. In Mozambique, [[Sofala]], [[Angoche]], and [[Mozambique Island]] were regional powers by the 15th century.

The towns traded with merchants from both the African interior and the broader Indian Ocean world. Particularly important were the gold and ivory caravan routes. Inland states like the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] provided the coveted gold and ivory, which were then exchanged up the coast to larger port cities like [[Kilwa]] and [[Mombasa]].<ref>Newitt, Malyn.

From about 1500, Portuguese trading posts and forts displaced the Arabic commercial and military hegemony, becoming regular ports of call on the new European sea route to the east.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

The voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1498 marked the Portuguese entry into trade, politics, and society of the region. The Portuguese gained control of the [[Island of Mozambique]] and the port city of [[Sofala]] in the early 16th century, and by the 1530s, small groups of Portuguese traders and [[prospecting|prospectors]] seeking gold penetrated the interior regions, where they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, Mozambique|Sena]] and [[Tete]] on the River [[Zambezi]] and tried to gain exclusive control over the gold trade.<ref name="auto">[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CuZ3lXGFz4C&pg=PP1&dq=Arming+slaves Arming Slaves], ''Arming slaves: from classical times to the modern age'', Christopher Leslie Brown, Philip D.

In the central part of the Mozambique territory, the Portuguese attempted to legitimise and consolidate their trade and settlement positions through the creation of ''prazos'' (land grants) tied to their settlement and administration. While ''prazos'' were originally developed to be held by Portuguese, through intermarriage they became African Portuguese or African Indian centres defended by large African slave armies known as ''[[Kunda people|Chikunda]]''.{{clarify|date=December 2018}}{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}
Historically within Mozambique there was slavery. Human beings were bought and sold by African tribal chiefs, first to Arab Muslim traders and sent to Middle East Asia cities and plantations, and later to Portuguese and other European traders as well. Many Mozambican slaves were supplied by tribal chiefs who raided warring tribes and sold their captives to the ''prazeiros''.<ref name="auto"/>
[[File:Lourenco-Marques-pc-c1905.jpg|thumb|View of the Central Avenue in Lourenço Marques, now Maputo, ca. 1905;]]

Although Portuguese influence gradually expanded, its power was limited and exercised through individual settlers and officials who were granted extensive autonomy. The Portuguese were able to wrest much of the coastal trade from Arab Muslims between 1500 and 1700, but, with the Arab Muslim seizure of Portugal's key foothold at [[Fort Jesus]] on [[Mombasa Island]] (now in Kenya) in 1698, the pendulum began to swing in the other direction. As a result, investment lagged while [[Lisbon]] devoted itself to the more lucrative trade with India and the Far East and to the colonisation of Brazil.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

During these wars, the [[Mazrui]] and [[History of Oman|Omani Arabs]] reclaimed much of the Indian Ocean trade, forcing the Portuguese to retreat south. Many ''prazos'' had declined by the mid-19th century, but several of them survived. During the 19th century other European powers, particularly the British ([[British South Africa Company]]) and the French (Madagascar), became increasingly involved in the trade and politics of the region around the [[Portuguese East Africa]]n territories.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

By the early 20th century the Portuguese had shifted the administration of much of Mozambique to large private companies, like the [[Mozambique Company]], the [[Zambezia Province|Zambezia Company]] and the [[Niassa Company]], controlled and financed mostly by "British" financiers such as [[Solomon Joel]], which established railroad lines to their neighbouring colonies (South Africa and Rhodesia). Although slavery had been legally abolished in Mozambique, at the end of the 19th century the Chartered companies enacted a forced labour policy and supplied cheap—often forced—African labour to the [[mining|mines]] and [[plantation]]s of the nearby British colonies and South Africa.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> The Zambezia Company, the most profitable chartered company, took over a number of smaller ''prazeiro'' holdings, and established military outposts to protect its property. The chartered companies built roads and ports to bring their goods to market including a railroad linking present day Zimbabwe with the Mozambican port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]].<ref name="The Cambridge history of Africa">[https://books.google.com/books?id=zywkdNMeltkC&pg=PA495&dq=chartered+companies+mozambique#PPA496,M1 The Cambridge history of Africa], The Cambridge history of Africa, John Donnelly Fage, A.

Due to their unsatisfactory performance and the shift, under the [[corporatist]] [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime of [[Oliveira Salazar]], towards a stronger Portuguese control of [[Portuguese Empire]]'s economy, the companies' concessions were not renewed when they ran out. This was what happened in 1942 with the Mozambique Company, which however continued to operate in the agricultural and commercial sectors as a corporation, and had already happened in 1929 with the termination of the Niassa Company's concession. In 1951, the Portuguese overseas colonies in Africa were rebranded as Overseas Provinces of Portugal.<ref name="The Cambridge history of Africa"/><ref name="The Third Portuguese Empire, 1825-1975"/><ref>[http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090928143505/http%3A//digitarq%2Edgarq%2Egov%2Ept/default%2Easpx?page%3DregShow%26ID%3D1117748%26searchMode%3Dlf Agência Geral do Ultramar]. dgarq.gov.pt</ref>

{{Main|Mozambican War of Independence}}
As [[communism|communist]] and [[anti-colonial]] ideologies spread out across Africa, many clandestine political movements were established in support of Mozambican independence. These movements claimed that since policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of Mozambique's Portuguese population, little attention was paid to Mozambique's tribal integration and the development of its native communities.<ref>Dinerman, Alice (26 September 2007). [https://web.archive.org/web/20150424020524/http://www.ipri.pt/publicacoes/revista_ri/artigo_rri.php?ida=173 Independence redux in postsocialist Mozambique]. ipri.pt</ref>

According to the official guerrilla statements, this affected a majority of the indigenous population who suffered both state-sponsored discrimination and enormous social pressure. Many felt they had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans. Statistically, Mozambique's Portuguese whites were indeed wealthier and more skilled than the black indigenous majority. As a response to the guerrilla movement, the Portuguese government from the 1960s and principally the early 1970s, initiated gradual changes with new socioeconomic developments and egalitarian policies for all. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Front for the Liberation of Mozambique ([[FRELIMO]]) initiated a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule in September 1964. This conflict—along with the two others already initiated in the other Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]]—became part of the so-called [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961–1974). From a military standpoint, the Portuguese regular army maintained control of the population centres while the guerrilla forces sought to undermine their influence in rural and tribal areas in the north and west. As part of their response to FRELIMO, the Portuguese government began to pay more attention to creating favourable conditions for social development and economic growth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HegjL_5tD6o |title=CD do Diário de Notícias – Parte 08 |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref>

=== Independence (1975) ===
FRELIMO took control of the territory after 10 years of sporadic warfare, as well as Portugal's own return to democracy after the fall of the authoritarian [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime the [[Carnation Revolution]] of April 1974, and the failed [[coup of 25 November 1975]]. Within a year, most of the 250,000 Portuguese in Mozambique had left—some expelled by the government of the nearly independent territory, some fleeing in fear—and Mozambique became independent from Portugal on 25 June 1975. A law had been passed on the initiative of the relatively unknown [[Armando Guebuza]] of the FRELIMO party, ordering the Portuguese to leave the country in 24 hours with only {{convert|20|kg|lb|lk=out|abbr=off}} of luggage. Unable to salvage any of their assets, most of them returned to Portugal penniless.<ref>Couto, Mia (April  2004). [http://mondediplo.com/2004/04/15mozambique Carnation revolution].

[[File:Land mine victim 2 (4364914733).jpg|thumb|left|A land mine victim in Mozambique]]
The new government under president [[Samora Machel]] established a [[one-party state]] based on [[Marxism|Marxist]] principles. It received diplomatic and some military support from [[Cuba]] and the [[Soviet Union]] and proceeded to crack down on opposition.<ref>''Mozambique: a tortuous road to democracy'' by J .Cabrita, Macmillan 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-333-92001-5}}</ref> Starting shortly after the independence, the country was plagued from 1977 to 1992 by a long and violent civil war between the opposition forces of anti-Communist Mozambican National Resistance ([[RENAMO]]) rebel militias and the FRELIMO regime. This conflict characterised the first decades of Mozambican independence, combined with sabotage from the neighbouring states of [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa, ineffective policies, failed central planning, and the resulting economic collapse. This period was also marked by the exodus of Portuguese nationals and Mozambicans of Portuguese heritage,<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''Time'' (Monday, 7 July 1975).</ref> a collapsed infrastructure, lack of investment in productive assets, and government nationalisation of privately owned industries, as well as widespread famine.

During most of the civil war, the FRELIMO-formed central government was unable to exercise effective control outside of urban areas, many of which were cut off from the capital.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> RENAMO-controlled areas included up to 50% of the rural areas in several provinces, and it is reported that health services of any kind were isolated from assistance for years in those areas. The problem worsened when the government cut back spending on health care.<ref name="Pfeiffer.

During the war, RENAMO proposed a peace agreement based on the secession of RENAMO-controlled northern and western territories as the independent ''Republic of Rombesia'', but FRELIMO refused, insisting on the undivided sovereignty of the entire country. An estimated one million Mozambicans perished during the civil war, 1.7 million took refuge in neighbouring states, and several million more were internally displaced.<ref>Perlez, Jane (13 October 1992).

On 19 October 1986, Samora Machel was on his way back from an international meeting in [[Zambia]] in the presidential [[Tupolev Tu-134]] aircraft when the [[1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash|plane crashed]] in the [[Lebombo Mountains]] near [[Mbuzini]]. There were ten survivors, but President Machel and thirty-three others died, including ministers and officials of the Mozambique government. The [[United Nations]]' [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] delegation issued a minority report contending that their expertise and experience had been undermined by the South Africans. Representatives of the Soviet Union advanced the theory that the plane had been intentionally diverted by a false [[VHF omnidirectional range|navigational beacon]] signal, using a technology provided by military intelligence operatives of the South African government.<ref name="TRC">{{cite web |title=Special Investigation into the death of President Samora Machel |work=[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)]] Report, vol.2, chapter 6a |url=http://www.news24.com/Content_Display/TRC_Report/2chap6a.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060413084020/http://www.news24.com/Content_Display/TRC_Report/2chap6a.htm |archivedate=13 April 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2006}}</ref>

Machel's successor [[Joaquim Chissano]] implemented sweeping changes in the country, starting reforms such as changing from Marxism to capitalism, and began peace talks with RENAMO. The new constitution enacted in 1990 provided for a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]], [[market economy|market-based economy]], and free elections. The civil war ended in October 1992 with the [[Rome General Peace Accords]], first brokered by the Christian Council of Mozambique (Council of Protestant Churches) and then taken over by [[Community of Sant'Egidio]]. Peace returned to Mozambique, under supervision of the [[ONUMOZ]] peacekeeping force of the United Nations.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110516080313/http://popp.gmu.edu/resource-bk/mission/onumoz.html UNITED NATIONS OPERATION IN MOZAMBIQUE]. popp.gmu.edu</ref><ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

===Democratic era (1993–present)===
[[File:Helicopter over flooded Central Mozambique.jpg|thumb|A US helicopter flying over the flooded Limpopo River during the [[2000 Mozambique flood]].]]
Mozambique held elections in 1994, which were accepted by most political parties as free and fair although still contested by many nationals and observers alike. [[FRELIMO]] won, under Joaquim Chissano, while [[RENAMO]], led by [[Afonso Dhlakama]], ran as the official opposition.

In 1995, Mozambique joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], becoming, at the time, the only member nation that had never been part of the [[British Empire]].

By mid-1995, over 1.7 million refugees who had sought asylum in neighbouring countries had returned to Mozambique, part of the largest repatriation witnessed in sub-Saharan Africa. An additional four million [[internally displaced person]]s had returned to their homes.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

In December 1999, Mozambique held elections for a second time since the civil war, which were again won by FRELIMO. RENAMO accused FRELIMO of fraud, and threatened to return to civil war, but backed down after taking the matter to the Supreme Court and losing.

In early 2000, a [[cyclone]] caused [[2000 Mozambique flood|widespread flooding]] in the country, killing hundreds and devastating the already precarious infrastructure. There were widespread suspicions that foreign aid resources had been diverted by powerful leaders of FRELIMO. [[Carlos Cardoso (journalist)|Carlos Cardoso]], a journalist investigating these allegations, was murdered, and his death was never satisfactorily explained.

Indicating in 2001 that he would not run for a third term, Chissano criticised leaders who stayed on longer than he had, which was generally seen as a reference to [[Zambia]]n president [[Frederick Chiluba]], who at the time was considering a third term, and [[Zimbabwe]]an president [[Robert Mugabe]], then in his fourth term. Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on 1–2 December 2004. FRELIMO candidate [[Armando Guebuza]] won with 64% of the popular vote, while his opponent, [[Afonso Dhlakama]] of RENAMO, received 32% of the popular vote. FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament, with a coalition of RENAMO and several small parties winning the 90 remaining seats. Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of Mozambique on 2 February 2005, and served two five-year terms. His successor, [[Filipe Nyusi]], became the 4th President of Mozambique on 15 January 2015.

Since 2013, a low-intensity [[RENAMO insurgency (2013–present)|insurgency by RENAMO]] has been occurring, mainly in the country's central and northern regions. On 5 September 2014, former president Guebuza and the leader of RENAMO Dhlakama signed the Accord on Cessation of Hostilities, which brought the military hostilities to a halt and allowed both parties to concentrate on the general elections to be held in October 2014. However, after the general elections, a new political crisis emerged and the country appears to be once again on the brink of violent conflict. RENAMO does not recognise the validity of the election results, and demands the control of six provinces – Nampula, Niassa, Tete, Zambezia, Sofala, and Manica – where they claim to have won a majority.<ref name=":02"/> About 12,000 refugees are now in neighbouring [[Malawi]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/07/mozambican-refugees-stuck-160713073920585.html|title=Mozambican refugees stuck between somewhere and nowhere|publisher=aljazeera |accessdate=23 July 2016|date=22 July 2016}}</ref> The [[UNHCR]], [[Doctors Without Borders]], and [[Human Rights Watch]] have reported that government forces have torched villages and carried out [[summary execution]]s and [[Wartime sexual violence|sexual abuses]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/06/mozambiques-invisible-civil-war-renamo-frelimo-dhlakama-nyusi/|title=Mozambique’s Invisible Civil War |publisher=foreign policy|accessdate=6 May 2016|date=22 July 2016}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
{{Main|Geography of Mozambique}}
[[File:Mozambique sat.png|thumb|upright=0.45|Satellite image]]
At {{convert|309475|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on}}, Mozambique is the world's 36th-largest country. It is comparable in size to Turkey. Mozambique is located on the southeast coast of Africa. It is bound by Swaziland to the south, South Africa to the southwest, Zimbabwe to the west, [[Zambia]] and [[Malawi]] to the northwest, [[Tanzania]] to the north and the Indian Ocean to the east. Mozambique lies between latitudes [[10th parallel south|10°]] and [[27th parallel south|27°S]], and longitudes [[30th meridian east|30°]] and [[41st meridian east|41°E]].

The country is divided into two topographical regions by the [[Zambezi River]]. To the north of the [[Zambezi]] River, the narrow coastal strip gives way to inland hills and low plateaus. Rugged highlands are further west; they include the [[Niassa]] highlands, [[Namuli]] or Shire highlands, Angonia highlands, [[Tete]] highlands and the [[Makonde (District)|Makonde]] plateau, covered with [[miombo]] woodlands. To the south of the Zambezi River, the lowlands are broader with the Mashonaland plateau and [[Lebombo Mountains]] located in the deep south.

The country is drained by five principal rivers and several smaller ones with the largest and most important the Zambezi. The country has four notable lakes: [[Lake Niassa]] (or Malawi), [[Lake Chiuta]], [[Lake Cahora Bassa]] and [[Lake Shirwa]], all in the north. The major cities are [[Maputo]], [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Nampula]], [[Tete]], [[Quelimane]], [[Chimoio]], [[Pemba, Mozambique|Pemba]], [[Inhambane]], [[Xai-Xai]] and [[Lichinga]].

===Climate===
[[File:Koppen-Geiger Map MOZ present.svg|thumb|Mozambique map of Köppen climate classification]]
{{Main|Climate of Mozambique}}
Mozambique has a tropical climate with two seasons, a wet season from October to March and a dry season from April to September. Climatic conditions, however, vary depending on altitude. Rainfall is heavy along the coast and decreases in the north and south. Annual precipitation varies from {{convert|500|to|900|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} depending on the region, with an average of {{convert|590|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}. Cyclones are common during the wet season. Average temperature ranges in Maputo are from {{convert|13|to|24|C|F|1}} in July and from {{convert|22|to|31|C|F|1}} in February.

===Wildlife===
{{Main|Wildlife of Mozambique}}
{{See also|Category:Flora of Mozambique|List of marine molluscs of Mozambique|List of non-marine molluscs of Mozambique}}
There are known to be [[List of birds of Mozambique|740 bird species]] in Mozambique, including 20 globally threatened species and two introduced species, and [[List of mammals of Mozambique|over 200 mammal species]] endemic to Mozambique, including the critically endangered [[Selous' zebra]], [[Vincent's bush squirrel]] and 13 other endangered or vulnerable species.

[[Protected areas of Mozambique]] include thirteen forest reserves, seven national parks, six nature reserves, three frontier conservation areas and three wildlife or game reserves.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Mozambique}}

[[File:Filipe Nyusi.jpg|thumb|left|Incumbent President [[Filipe Nyusi]].]]
[[File:Conselho Municipal de Maputo frente.jpg|thumb|left|Maputo City Hall]]
Mozambique is a multi-party democracy under the 1990 constitution. The executive branch comprises a President, [[Heads of Government of Mozambique|Prime Minister]], and Council of Ministers. There is a [[Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique|National Assembly]] and municipal assemblies. The judiciary comprises a Supreme Court and provincial, district, and municipal courts. [[Suffrage]] is universal at eighteen. In the 1994 [[Elections in Mozambique|elections]], [[Joaquim Chissano]] was elected President with 53% of the vote, and a 250-member National Assembly was voted in with 129 [[FRELIMO|Liberation Front of Mozambique]] ([[FRELIMO]]) deputies, 112 [[RENAMO|Mozambican National Resistance]] ([[RENAMO]]) deputies, and nine representatives of three smaller parties that formed the Democratic Union (UD). Since its formation in 1994, the National Assembly has made progress in becoming a body increasingly more independent of the executive. By 1999, more than one-half (53%) of the legislation passed originated in the Assembly.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

After some delays, in 1998 the country held its first local elections to provide for local representation and some budgetary authority at the municipal level. The principal opposition party, RENAMO, boycotted the local elections, citing flaws in the registration process. Independent slates contested the elections and won seats in municipal assemblies. Turnout was very low.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

In the aftermath of the 1998 local elections, the government resolved to make more accommodations to the opposition's procedural concerns for the second round of multiparty national elections in 1999. Working through the National Assembly, the electoral law was rewritten and passed by consensus in December 1998. Financed largely by international donors, a very successful voter registration was conducted from July to September 1999, providing voter registration cards to 85% of the potential electorate (more than seven million voters).<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

The second general elections were held 3–5 December 1999, with high [[voter turnout]]. International and domestic observers agreed that the voting process was well organised and went smoothly. Both the opposition and observers subsequently cited flaws in the tabulation process that, had they not occurred, might have changed the outcome. In the end, however, international and domestic observers concluded that the close result of the vote reflected the will of the people.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

President Chissano won the presidency with a margin of 4% over the RENAMO-Electoral Union coalition candidate, [[Afonso Dhlakama]], and began his five-year term in January 2000. [[FRELIMO]] increased its majority in the National Assembly with 133 out of 250 seats. RENAMO-UE coalition won 116 seats, one went independent, and no third parties are represented.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

The opposition coalition did not accept the National Election Commission's results of the presidential vote and filed a formal complaint to the Supreme Court. One month after the voting, the court dismissed the opposition's challenge and validated the election results. The opposition did not file a complaint about the results of the legislative vote.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

The second local elections, involving thirty-three municipalities with some 2.4&nbsp;million registered voters, took place in November 2003. This was the first time that FRELIMO, RENAMO-UE, and independent parties competed without significant boycotts. The 24% turnout was well above the 15% turnout in the first municipal elections. FRELIMO won twenty-eight mayoral positions and the majority in twenty-nine municipal assemblies, while RENAMO won five mayoral positions and the majority in four municipal assemblies. The voting was conducted in an orderly fashion without violent incidents. However, the period immediately after the elections was marked by objections about voter and candidate registration and vote tabulation, as well as calls for greater transparency.

In May 2009, the government approved a new general elections law that contained innovations based on the experience of the 2003 municipal elections. Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on 1–2 December 2004. FRELIMO candidate [[Armando Guebuza]] won with 64% of the popular vote. His opponent, Afonso Dhlakama of RENAMO, received 32% of the popular vote. FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament. A coalition of RENAMO and several small parties won the 90 remaining seats. Armando Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of Mozambique on 2 February 2005.

RENAMO and some other opposition parties made claims of election fraud and denounced the result. These claims were supported by international observers (among others by the European Union Election Observation Mission to Mozambique and the Carter Centre) to the elections who criticised the fact that the National Electoral Commission (CNE) did not conduct fair and transparent elections. They listed a whole range of shortcomings by the electoral authorities that benefited the ruling party FRELIMO.

According to EU observers, the elections shortcomings have probably not affected the final result in the presidential election. On the other hand, the observers have declared that the outcome of the parliamentary election and thus the distribution of seats in the National Assembly does not reflect the will of the Mozambican people and is clearly to the disadvantage of RENAMO.

After clashes between RENAMO guards and the police in Muxungue and Gondola in April 2013, RENAMO said it would boycott and disrupt local elections in November 2013. Since the end of the civil war in 1992, about 300 RENAMO guards had remained armed and refused to join the national army or the police force.<ref>(4 April 2013) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22031922 Mozambican ex-rebels Renamo in police clash] BBC News Africa, Retrieved 5 April 2013.</ref>

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Mozambique}}
[[File:Embassy of Mozambique, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|Mozambique's embassy in Washington, D.C.]]
While allegiances dating back to the liberation struggle remain relevant, Mozambique's foreign policy has become increasingly pragmatic. The twin pillars of Mozambique's foreign policy are maintenance of good relations with its neighbours<ref>Schenoni, Luis (2017) "Subsystemic Unipolarities?"in Strategic Analysis, 41(1): 74-86 [https://www.academia.edu/30528886/_Subsystemic_Unipolarities_Power_Distribution_and_State_Behaviour_in_South_America_and_Southern_Africa_in_Strategic_Analysis_41_1_74-86]</ref> and maintenance and expansion of ties to development partners.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

During the 1970s and the early 1980s, Mozambique's foreign policy was inextricably linked to the struggles for majority rule in [[Rhodesia]] and South Africa as well as superpower competition and the [[Cold War]].<ref>[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/7035.htm Mozambique]. State.gov (13 June 2012). Retrieved on 29 January 2013.</ref> Mozambique's decision to enforce UN sanctions against Rhodesia and deny that country access to the sea led [[Ian Smith]]'s government to undertake overt and covert actions to oppose the country. Although the change of government in Zimbabwe in 1980 removed this threat, the government of South Africa continued to destabilize Mozambique.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> Mozambique also belonged to the [[Front Line States]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/frontline-states|title=Frontline States|last=sahoboss|date=2011-03-30|website=South African History Online|language=en|access-date=2019-03-11}}</ref>.

The 1984 [[Nkomati Accord]], while failing in its goal of ending South African support to RENAMO, opened initial diplomatic contacts between the Mozambican and South African governments. This process gained momentum with South Africa's elimination of [[apartheid]], which culminated in the establishment of full diplomatic relations in October 1993. While relations with neighbouring Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and Tanzania show occasional strains, Mozambique's ties to these countries remain strong.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

In the years immediately following its independence, Mozambique benefited from considerable assistance from some Western countries, notably the [[Scandinavia]]ns. The Soviet Union and its allies became Mozambique's primary economic, military and political supporters, and its foreign policy reflected this linkage. This began to change in 1983; in 1984 Mozambique joined the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]]. Western aid by the Scandinavian countries of [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]] and [[Iceland]] quickly replaced Soviet support.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> [[Finland]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081223005117/http://www.tpk.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=71407&intSubArtID=28199 President Halonen: Development aid should be transparent and efficient]. Office of the President of the Republic of Finland. tpk.fi</ref> and the [[Netherlands]] are becoming increasingly important sources of development assistance. [[Italy]] also maintains a profile in Mozambique as a result of its key role during the peace process. Relations with Portugal, the former colonial power, continue to be important because Portuguese investors play a visible role in Mozambique's economy.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

Mozambique is a member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and ranks among the moderate members of the African bloc in the United Nations and other international organisations. Mozambique also belongs to the [[African Union]] (formerly the [[Organisation of African Unity]]) and the [[Southern African Development Community]]. In 1994, the government became a full member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], in part to broaden its base of international support but also to please the country's sizeable Muslim population. Similarly, in 1995 Mozambique joined its [[Anglophone]] neighbours in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. At the time it was the only nation to have joined the Commonwealth that was never part of the [[British Empire]]. In the same year, Mozambique became a founding member and the first President of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP), and maintains close ties with other [[Portuguese-speaking]] countries.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Provinces of Mozambique|Districts of Mozambique|Postos of Mozambique}}

Mozambique is divided into ten provinces (''provincias'') and one capital city (''cidade capital'') with provincial status. The provinces are subdivided into 129 districts (''distritos''). The districts are further divided in 405 "Postos Administrativos" (Administrative Posts) and then into Localidades (Localities), the lowest geographical level of the central state administration. Since 1998, 53 "Municípios" (Municipalities) have been created in Mozambique.

|}

The [[districts of Mozambique]] are divided into 405 ''postos''.

''Postos administrativos'' (administrative posts) are the main subdivisions of districts. This name, in use during colonial times, was abolished after independence<ref>Decreto-lei nº 6/75 de 18 de Janeiro.</ref> and was replaced by ''localidades'' (localities). However, it was re-established in 1986.<ref>Lei nº 4/86 de 25 de Julho.</ref>

Administrative posts are headed by a ''Secretários'' (secretaries), which before independence were called ''Chefes de Posto'' (post chiefs).

Administrative posts can be further subdivided into localities, also headed by secretaries.

=== Military ===

Mozambique operates a small, functioning military that handles all aspects of domestic national defence, the [[Mozambique Defence Armed Forces]].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Mozambique}}

[[File:Mozambique treemap.png|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Mozambique's exports]]
The official currency is the [[Mozambican metical|New Metical]] (as of March 2018, US$1 is roughly equivalent to 62 New Meticals), which replaced old Meticals at the rate of a thousand to one. The old currency was redeemable at the [[Bank of Mozambique]] until the end of 2012. The US$, [[South African rand]], and recently the [[euro]] are also widely accepted and used in business transactions. The minimum legal salary is around US$60 per month. Mozambique is a member of the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC).<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> The SADC [[free trade]] protocol is aimed at making the Southern African region more competitive by eliminating [[tariff]]s and other [[trade barrier]]s. The [[World Bank]] in 2007 talked of Mozambique's 'blistering pace of economic growth'. A joint donor-government study in early 2007 said 'Mozambique is generally considered an aid success story.' The [[IMF]] in early 2007 said 'Mozambique is a success story in Sub-Saharan Africa.' Yet, despite this apparent success, both the World Bank and [[UNICEF]] used the word 'paradox' to describe rising chronic [[child malnutrition]] in the face of GDP growth. Between 1994 and 2006, average annual GDP growth was approximately 8%, however, the country remains one of the poorest and most underdeveloped in the world. In a 2006 survey, three-quarters of Mozambicans said that in the past five years their economic position had remained the same or become worse.<ref>Hanlon, Joseph (19 September 2007).

===Rebounding growth===

The resettlement of [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] [[war refugee|refugees]] and successful economic reform have led to a high growth rate: the country enjoyed a remarkable recovery, achieving an average annual rate of economic growth of 8% between 1996 and 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iceida.is/english/main-activities/mozambique/ |title=Mozambique &#124; Partner Countries and Activities &#124; English &#124; Þróunarsamvinnustofnun Íslands |language=is |publisher=Iceida.is |date=1 June 1999 |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104193348/http://www.iceida.is/english/main-activities/mozambique/ |archive-date=4 November 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and between 6–7% from 2006 to 2011.<ref name="databank.worldbank.org">[https://web.archive.org/web/20150626193432/http://databank.worldbank.org/data/views/reports/tableview.aspx World DataBank World Development Indicators Mozambique] The World Bank (2013), Retrieved 5 April 2013</ref> The devastating [[2000 Mozambique flood|floods of early 2000]] slowed GDP growth to 2.1%,<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> but a full recovery was achieved in 2001 with growth of 14.8%.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

===Economic reforms===
{{wide image|Maputo.jpg|800px|[[Maputo]], the capital of Mozambique is the largest city in the country and is separate from the [[Maputo Province]]. On the image the [[Port Maputo|Port of Maputo]] is featured, the second largest in [[East Africa]]}}
More than 1,200 mostly small [[Nationalization|state-owned enterprises]] have been [[privatised]]. Preparations for privatisation and/or sector liberalisation were made for the remaining parastatal enterprises, including telecommunications, energy, ports, and railways. The government frequently selected a strategic foreign investor when privatising a parastatal. Additionally, customs duties have been reduced, and customs management has been streamlined and reformed. The government introduced a value-added tax in 1999 as part of its efforts to increase domestic revenues.

===Corruption===
[[File:Mozambique - traditional sailboat.jpg|thumb|Traditional sailboat in [[Ilha de Moçambique]]]]
Mozambique's economy has been shaken by a number of corruption scandals. In July 2011, the government proposed new anti-corruption laws to criminalise embezzlement, influence peddling and graft, following numerous instances of the theft of public money. This has been endorsed by the country's Council of Ministers. Mozambique has convicted two former ministers for graft in the past two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hZuxkSpKgin_BueKk3H5zJZlAGPg?docId=CNG.259d978e5386bee2f4d1714fe4a141a2.6a1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223212643/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hZuxkSpKgin_BueKk3H5zJZlAGPg?docId=CNG.259d978e5386bee2f4d1714fe4a141a2.6a1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 February 2014 | title=Mozambique proposes new anti-corruption laws | author=AFP| publisher=Google News| date=27 July 2011}}</ref>

Mozambique was ranked 116 of 178 countries in anti-graft watchdog [[Transparency International]]'s latest index of global corruption. According to a USAID report written in 2005, "the scale and scope of corruption in Mozambique are cause for alarm."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://maputo.usembassy.gov/uploads/images/q3naBGGSYz8BsCXguSD5Pw/Final_Report-Mozambique__Corruption_Assessment-without_internal_rec.pdf| title=CORRUPTION ASSESSMENT: MOZAMBIQU| publisher=USAID| date=16 December 2005| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174654/http://maputo.usembassy.gov/uploads/images/q3naBGGSYz8BsCXguSD5Pw/Final_Report-Mozambique__Corruption_Assessment-without_internal_rec.pdf| archivedate=3 March 2016| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In March 2012, the government of the southern Mozambican province of Inhambane uncovered the misappropriation of public funds by the director of the Provincial Anti-Drugs Office, Calisto Alberto Tomo. He was found to have colluded with the accountant in the Anti-Drugs Office, Recalda Guambe, to steal over 260,000 meticais between 2008 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201203271192.html | title=Mozambique: Corruption Alleged in Anti-Drugs Office | publisher=All Africa| date=27 March 2012}}</ref>

The government of Mozambique has taken steps to address the problem of corruption, and some positive developments can be observed, such as the passages of several new anti-corruption bills in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mozambique Corruption Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/mozambique/show-all.aspx|website=Business Anti-Corruption Profile|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>

Modes of [[transport]] in Mozambique include [[rail transport|rail]], [[road transport|road]], [[water transport|water]], and [[air transport|air]].

There are over 30,000&nbsp;km of roads, but much of the network is unpaved. Like its [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] neighbours, [[Left- and right-hand traffic|traffic circulates on the left]].

There is an  international [[airport]] at [[Maputo International Airport|Maputo]], 21 other paved airports, and over 100 airstrips with unpaved runways.

On the [[Indian Ocean]] coast are several large [[seaport]]s, including [[Nacala]], [[Beira (Mozambique)|Beira]] and [[Maputo]], with further ports being developed. There are 3,750&nbsp;km of [[Navigability|navigable]] inland waterways. 
There are rail links serving principal cities and connecting the country with [[Malawi]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]]. 
The Mozambican railway system developed over more than a century from three different ports on the [[Indian Ocean]] that served as terminals for separate lines to the hinterland.  The railroads were major targets during the [[Mozambican Civil War]], were sabotaged by [[RENAMO]], and are being rehabilitated. A [[parastatal]] authority, ''Portos e Caminhos de Ferro de Moçambique'' (abbreviated CFM; in English '''Mozambique Ports and Railways'''), oversees the railway system of Mozambique and its connected ports, but management has been largely outsourced.  Each line has its own development corridor.

{{As of|2005}} there were 3,123&nbsp;km of railway track, consisting of 2,983&nbsp;km of {{RailGauge|1067mm|lk=on}} gauge, compatible with neighbouring rail systems, and a 140&nbsp;km line of {{RailGauge|762mm|lk=on}} gauge, the [[Gaza Railway]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mz.html#Econ|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov}}</ref> The central [[Beira Railroad Corporation]] route links the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] to the landlocked countries of Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Mozambique}}
[[File:Daily struggle for water (5400691444).jpg|thumb|Woman fetching water during the dry season from a polluted source in Machaze District of the Central Manica Province.]]
Water supply and sanitation in Mozambique is characterised by low levels of access to an [[improved water source]]
(estimated to be 51% in 2011), low levels of access to adequate
sanitation (estimated to be 25% in 2011) and mostly poor service
quality. In 2007 the government has defined a strategy for water supply
and sanitation in rural areas, where 62% of the population lives. In
urban areas, water is supplied by informal small-scale providers and by
formal providers.

Beginning in 1998, Mozambique has reformed the formal part
of the urban water supply sector through the creation of an independent
regulatory agency called CRA, an asset-holding company called FIPAG and a
[[Public-private partnership]]
(PPP) with a company called Aguas de Moçambique. The PPP covered those
areas of the capital and of four other cities that had access to formal
water supply systems. However, the PPP ended when the management
contracts for four cities expired in 2008 and when the foreign partner
of the company that serves the capital under a lease contract withdrew
in 2010, claiming heavy losses.

While urban water supply has received considerable policy
attention, the government has no strategy for urban sanitation yet.
External donors finance about 87.4% of all public investments in the
sector. The main donors in the water sector are the [[World Bank]], the [[African Development Bank]], Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Mz etnies.PNG|thumb|left|Ethnic map of Mozambique.]]
Portuguese is the official and most widely spoken language of the nation, spoken by 50.3% of the population.<ref>''[http://197.249.4.187/imismoz/censos/censo2007/CensoHTML/00/quadros/00quadro24.html "Quadro 24. População de 5 anos e mais por condição de conhecimento da língua portuguesa e sexo, segundo área de residência e idade"]'', [http://www.ine.gov.mz Instituto Nacional de Estatística], Maputo Moçambique, 2007</ref> Most Mozambicans living in the cities speak Portuguese as their first language.

The Bantu-group languages of Mozambique that are indigenous to the country vary greatly in their groupings and in some cases are rather poorly appreciated and documented.<ref name=r1>''Relatório do I Seminário sobre a Padronização da Ortografia de Línguas Moçambicanas''. NELIMO, Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, 1989.</ref> Apart from its lingua franca uses in the north of the country, [[Swahili language|Swahili]] is spoken in a small area of the coast next to the Tanzanian border; south of this, towards Moçambique Island, [[Kimwani]], regarded as a dialect of Swahili, is used. Immediately inland of the Swahili area, [[Makonde language|Makonde]] is used, separated farther inland by a small strip of [[Makhuwa]]-speaking territory from an area where [[Yao language|Yao]] or ChiYao is used. Makonde and Yao belong to a different group, Yao<ref>''Malangano ga Sambano'' (Yao New Testament), British and Foreign Bible Society, London, 1952</ref> being very close to the [[Mwera language]] of the Rondo Plateau area in Tanzania.<ref>Harries, Rev. Lyndon (1950), ''A Grammar of Mwera''. Witwatersrand University Press, Johannesburg.</ref>

Prepositions appear in these languages as locative prefixes prefixed to the noun and declined according to their own noun-class. Some [[Nyanja]] is used at the coast of Lake Malawi, as well as on the other side of the Lake.<ref>Barnes, Herbert (1902), [https://archive.org/details/nyanjaenglishvo00woodgoog ''Nyanja – English Vocabulary''] (mostly of Likoma Island). Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London.</ref><ref>''ChiChewa Intensive Course,'' (Chewa is similar to Nyanja) Lilongwe, Malawi, 1969.</ref>

Somewhat different from all of these are the languages of the eMakhuwa group, with a loss of initial k-, which means that many nouns begin with a vowel: for example, ''epula'' = "rain".<ref name=r1/>

There is eMakhuwa proper, with the related [[eLomwe]] and [[eChuwabo]], with a small [[eKoti]]-speaking area at the coast. In an area straddling the lower Zambezi, [[Sena language|Sena]], which belongs to the same group as Nyanja, is spoken, with areas speaking the related CiNyungwe and [[CiSenga]] further upriver.

A large [[Shona language|Shona]]-speaking area extends between the Zimbabwe border and the sea: this was formerly known the [[Ndau people|Ndau]] variety<ref>Doke, Clement, ''A Comparative Study in Shona Phonetics''. University of Witwatersrand Press. 1931.</ref> but now uses the orthography of the Standard Shona of Zimbabwe. Apparently similar to Shona, but lacking the tone patterns of the Shona language, and regarded by its speakers as quite separate, is CiBalke, also called [[Rue language|Rue]] or [[Barwe language|Barwe]], used in a small area near the Zimbabwe border.<!-- or just Sena? -->

South of this area are languages of the [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] group, which are quite different again. XiTswa or [[Tswa]] occurs at the coast and inland, XiTsonga or [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] straddles the area around the Limpopo River, including such local dialects as XiHlanganu, XiN'walungu, XiBila, XiHlengwe, and XiDzonga. This language area extends into neighbouring South Africa. Still related to these, but distinct, are GiTonga and CiCopi or [[Chopi language|Chopi]], spoken north of the mouth of the Limpopo, and XiRonga or [[Ronga]], spoken in the immediate region around Maputo. The languages in this group are, judging by the short vocabularies,<ref name=r1/> very vaguely similar to [[Zulu language|Zulu]], but obviously not in the same immediate group. There are small [[Swazi language|Swazi]]- and [[Zulu language|Zulu]]-speaking areas in Mozambique immediately next to the Swaziland and KwaZulu-Natal borders.

Arabs, Chinese, and Indians primarily speak Portuguese and some Hindi. Indians from Portuguese India speak any of the [[Portuguese Creole]]s of their origin aside from Portuguese as their second language.

The 2007 census found that Christians made up 56.1% of Mozambique's population and Muslims comprised 17.9% of the population. 7.3% of the people held other beliefs, mainly [[animism]], and 18.7% had no religious beliefs.<ref name=CIA/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120118125117/http://www.ine.gov.mz/censo2007 3º Recenseamento Geral da População e Habitação]. 2007 Census of Mozambique. ine.gov.mz</ref> A more recent government survey conducted by the [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] Program in 2015 indicated that Catholicism had increased to 30.5% of the population, Muslims constituted 19.3%, and various Protestant groups a total of 44%.<ref name="DHS 2015">{{cite web|url=https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/AIS12/AIS12.pdf|title=Moçambique: Inquérito de Indicadores de Imunização, Malária e HIV/SIDA em Moçambique (IMASIDA), 2015|publisher=Ministério da Saúde & Instituto Nacional de Estatística|language=Portuguese|format=PDF|page=40|accessdate=20 April 2018}}</ref>

The Roman Catholic Church has established twelve dioceses (Beira, Chimoio, Gurué, Inhambane, Lichinga, Maputo, Nacala, Nampula, Pemba, Quelimane, Tete,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150409151525/http://www.diocesedetete.org.mz/diocese/index.php CELEBRANDO O ANO DA FÉ NA DIOCESE DE TETE]. diocesedetete.org.mz (7 September 2012)</ref> and Xai-Xai; archdioceses are [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Maputo]] and [[Nampula]]). Statistics for the dioceses range from a low 5.8% Catholics in the population in the diocese of Chimoio, to 32.50% in Quelimane diocese (Anuario catolico de Mocambique 2007).

The work of Methodism in Mozambique started in 1890. The Rev. Dr. Erwin Richards began a Methodist mission at Chicuque in Inhambane Province. A Igreja Metodista Unida em Moçambique (the UMC in Mozambique) observed the 100th anniversary of Methodist presence in Mozambique in 1990. Then-Mozambique President Chissano praised the work and role of the UMC to more than 10,000 people who attended the ceremony.

The United Methodist Church has tripled in size in Mozambique since 1998. There are now more than 150,000 members in more than 180 congregations of the 24 districts. New pastors are ordained each year. New churches are chartered each year in each Annual Conference (North and South).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moumethodist.org/pages/detail/1373|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510092507/http://www.moumethodist.org/pages/detail/1373|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-05-10|date=July 2011|title=UMC in Mozambique|work=moumethodist.org}}</ref>

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) has established a growing presence in Mozambique. It first began sending missionaries to Mozambique in 1999, and, as of April 2015, has more than 7,943 members.<ref>[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/mozambique/ LDS Statistics and Church Facts for Mozambique]. Mormonnewsroom.org. Retrieved on 21 June 2015.</ref>

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] has been present in Mozambique since the early 1950s but did not openly identify itself in those years because of the strong influence of the Catholic Church which did not recognise it officially as a world religion. The independence in 1975 saw the entrance of new pioneers. In total, there are about 3,000 declared Baha'is in Mozambique {{As of|2010|lc=y}}. The Administrative Committee is located in Maputo.

Muslims are particularly present in the north of the country. They are organised in several "[[tariqa]]" or [[Fraternity|brotherhoods]]. Two national organisations also exist—the ''Conselho Islâmico de Moçambique'' and the ''Congresso Islâmico de Moçambique''. There are also important Pakistani, Indian associations as well as some Shia communities.

Among the main [[Protestant]] churches are [[Igreja União Baptista de Moçambique]], the [[Assembleias de Deus]], the [[Seventh-day Adventists]], the [[Anglican Church of Southern Africa]], the Igreja do Evangelho Completo de Deus, the [[Igreja Metodista Unida]], the [[Igreja Presbiteriana de Moçambique]], the [[Igrejas de Cristo]] and the Assembleia Evangélica de Deus.

There is a very small but thriving Jewish community in Maputo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://forward.com/culture/392973/in-mozambique-a-very-small-jewish-community-thrives/|title=In Mozambique, A Jewish Community Thrives|last=JosephFebruary 1|first=Anne|last2=Images|first2=2018Getty|website=The Forward|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-19}}</ref>

The official [[List of countries by HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate|HIV prevalence]] in Mozambique in 2011 was 11.5% of the population aged between 15 and 49 years. In the southern parts of Mozambique—[[Maputo Province|Maputo]] and [[Gaza Province|Gaza]] provinces as well as the city of Maputo—the official figures are more than twice as high as the national average. In 2011 the health authorities estimated about 1.7 million Mozambicans were HIV-positive, of whom 600,000 were in need of anti-retroviral treatment. As of December 2011, 240,000 were receiving such treatment, increasing to 416,000 in March 2014 according to the health authorities. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemic in Mozambique seems to be levelling off.<ref>[http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216_WorldAIDSday_report_2011_en.pdf UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2011].

===Education===
{{Main|Education in Mozambique}}

Portuguese is the primary language of instruction in all of the Mozambican schools. All Mozambicans are required by law to attend school through the primary level; however, a lot of children in Mozambique do not go to primary school because they have to work for their families' subsistence farms for a living. In 2007, one million children still did not go to school, most of them from poor rural families, and almost half of all teachers in Mozambique were still unqualified. Girls’ enrollment increased from 3 million in 2002 to 4.1 million in 2006 while the completion rate increased from 31,000 to 90,000, which testified a very poor completion rate.<ref>[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/casestudies/files/africa/mozambique-primary-schools.asp Key facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109185153/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/casestudies/files/africa/mozambique-primary-schools.asp |date=9 January 2009 }}, Department for International Development (DFID), UK Government (24 May 2007)</ref>

After grade 7, pupils must take standardised national exams to enter secondary school, which runs from eighth to 10th grade. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Space in Mozambican universities is extremely limited; thus most pupils who complete pre-university school do not immediately proceed on to university studies. Many go to work as teachers or are unemployed. There are also institutes which give more vocational training, specialising in agricultural, technical or pedagogical studies, which students may attend after grade 10 in lieu of a pre-university school.

After independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Mozambican pupils continued to be admitted every year at Portuguese high schools, polytechnical institutes and universities, through bilateral agreements between the Portuguese government and the Mozambican government.

According to 2010 estimates, the [[literacy rate]] of Mozambique was 56.1% (70.8% male and 42.8% female).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mz.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}</ref> By 2015, this had increased to 58.8% (73.3% male and 45.4% female).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=EDULIT_DS&popupcustomise=true&lang=en#|title=Education|first=|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org}}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of Mozambique}}

===Cultural identity===
Mozambique was ruled by Portugal, and they share a main language (Portuguese) and main religion (Roman Catholicism). But since most of the people of Mozambique are [[Bantus]], most of the culture is native; for Bantus living in urban areas, there is some Portuguese influence. Mozambican culture also influences the [[culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]].

===Arts===
The [[Makonde people|Makonde]] are known for their wood carving and elaborate masks, that are commonly used in traditional dances. There are two different kinds of wood carvings: [[shetani]], (evil spirits), which are mostly carved in heavy [[ebony]], tall, and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces; and [[ujamaa]], which are totem-type carvings which illustrate lifelike faces of people and various figures. These sculptures are usually referred to as "family trees", because they tell stories of many generations.

During the last years of the colonial period, Mozambican art reflected the oppression by the colonial power, and became symbol of the resistance. After independence in 1975, the modern art came into a new phase. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter [[Malangatana Ngwenya]] and the sculptor [[Alberto Chissano]]. A lot of the post-independence art during the 1980s and 1990s reflect the political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation, and struggle.

Dances are usually intricate, highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique. There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out battles dressed in animal skins. The men of [[Makua (people)|Makua]] dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women in the northern part of the country perform a traditional dance called [[Tufo (dance)|''tufo'']], to celebrate [[Islam]]ic holidays.<ref>{{Cite book

===Cuisine===
{{See also|Portuguese cuisine|Cuisine of Mozambique|African cuisine}}
With a nearly 500-year presence in the country, the Portuguese have greatly influenced Mozambique's cuisine. Staples and crops such as [[cassava]] (a starchy root of Brazilian origin) and [[cashew]] nuts (also of Brazilian origin, though Mozambique was once the largest producer of these nuts{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}), and ''pãozinho'' (pronounced {{IPA-pt|pɐ̃wˈzĩɲu|}}, Portuguese-style French buns{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}), were brought in by the Portuguese. The use of spices and [[seasoning]]s such as [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[chili pepper]]s, fresh [[coriander]], garlic, onions, [[paprika]], red sweet peppers, and wine were introduced by the Portuguese, as were maize, [[millet]], potatoes, rice, [[sorghum]], and [[sugarcane]]. ''espetada'' ([[kebab]]), the popular ''inteiro com piripiri'' (whole chicken in [[piri-piri]] sauce), ''prego'' (steak roll), ''pudim'' ([[pudding]]), and ''rissóis'' (battered shrimp) are all Portuguese dishes commonly eaten in present-day Mozambique.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

===Media===
{{Main|Media of Mozambique}}
[[File:Radio Moçambique (4106248049).jpg|thumb|right|Headquarters of Rádio Moçambique in [[KaMpfumo]] district of [[Maputo]] (photo 2009)]]
Mozambican media is heavily influenced by the government.<ref name="salgado">{{cite book|last=Salgado|first=Susana|title=The Internet and Democracy Building in Lusophone African Countries|publisher=Ashgate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WC3jBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA79|page=79|year=2014}}</ref>

'''Newspapers''' have relatively low circulation rates, due to high newspaper prices and low [[literacy rate]]s.<ref name="salgado"/> Among the most highly circulated newspapers are state-controlled dailies, such as ''Noticias'' and ''Diário de Moçambique'', and the weekly ''Domingo''.<ref name="eisa">{{cite book|author=Matsimbe, Zefanias |year=2009 |chapter=Ch. 9: Mozambique|editor=Denis Kadima and Susan Booysen |title=Compendium of Elections in Southern Africa 1989–2009: 20 Years of Multiparty Democracy|publisher=EISA, Johannesburg|pages= 319–321|url=http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/mozambique-mass-media |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228040157/http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/mozambique-mass-media |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-02-28 }}</ref> Their circulation is mostly confined to Maputo.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mário|first1=Tomás Vieira|last2=UNESCO|title=Assessment of Media Development in Mozambique: Based on UNESCO's Media Development Indicators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sAd5d8P_GfkC|publisher=UNESCO|year=2011|page=123}}</ref> Most funding and advertising revenue is given to pro-government newspapers.<ref name="salgado"/> However, the number of private newspapers with critical views of the government have increased significantly in recent years.{{when|date=May 2016}}<ref name="eisa"/>

'''[[Radio]] programmes''' are the most influential form of media in the country due to their ease of access.<ref name="salgado"/> State-owned radio stations are more popular than privately owned media. This is exemplified by the government radio station, Rádio Moçambique, the most popular station in the country.<ref name="salgado"/> It was established shortly after Mozambique's independence.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Jerome S.|title=Broadcasting on the Short Waves, 1945 to Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux9fZj6izuEC&pg=PA221|publisher=McFarland|page=221|isbn=978-0786469024}}</ref>

The '''[[Television|T.V.]]''' stations watched by Mozambicans are STV, TIM, and TVM Televisão Moçambique. Through cable and satellite, viewers can access tens of other African, Asian, Brazilian, and European channels.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

=== Music ===
{{Further|Music of Mozambique}}
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}
The [[music of Mozambique]] serves many purposes, ranging from religious expression to traditional ceremonies. Musical instruments are usually handmade. Some of the instruments used in Mozambican musical expression include drums made of wood and animal skin; the ''lupembe'', a woodwind instrument made from animal horns or wood; and the [[marimba]], which is a kind of [[xylophone]] native to Mozambique and other parts of Africa. The marimba is a popular instrument with the [[Chopi people|Chopi]] of the south central coast, who are famous for their musical skill and dance.

Some{{who|date=January 2011}} would say that Mozambique's music is similar to [[reggae]] and [[West Indies|West Indian]] [[Calypso music|calypso]]. Other music types are popular in Mozambique like [[marrabenta]], [[kwaito]], [[afrobeat]] and other [[Lusophone music]] forms like [[fado]], [[bossa nova]], [[kizomba]] and [[semba]].

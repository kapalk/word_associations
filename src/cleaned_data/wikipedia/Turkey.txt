==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Turkey}}
The English name of Turkey (from [[Medieval Latin]] ''Turchia''/''Turquia''<ref name=arlen>{{cite book|title=Passage to Ararat|author= Michael J. Arlen|publisher=MacMillan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UahAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA159|page=159|year=2006|isbn= 978-0-374-53012-9}}</ref>) means "land of the Turks". [[Middle English]] usage of ''Turkye'' is evidenced in an early work by [[Chaucer]] called ''[[The Book of the Duchess]]'' (c. 1369). The phrase ''land of Torke'' is used in the 15th-century [[The Digby Conversion of Saint Paul|Digby Mysteries]]. Later usages can be found in the [[William Dunbar|Dunbar poems]], the 16th century ''[[Manipulus Vocabulorum]]'' ("Turkie, Tartaria") and [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''Sylva Sylvarum'' (Turky). The modern spelling "Turkey" dates back to at least 1719.<ref>{{Cite OED|Turkey}}</ref> The [[Turkish language|Turkish]] name ''Türkiye'' was adopted in 1923 under the influence of European usage.<ref name="arlen" />

Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists, such as [[Miletus]], [[Ephesus]], [[Smyrna]] (now [[İzmir]]) and [[Byzantium]] (now [[Istanbul]]), the latter founded by [[Greeks|Greek]] colonists from [[Megara]] in 657 BC.

Following the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 and the permanent division of the Roman Empire between his two sons, the city, which would popularly come to be known as [[Constantinople]], became the capital of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

In the latter half of the 11th century, the Seljuk Turks began penetrating into [[medieval Armenia]] and the eastern regions of Anatolia. In 1071, the Seljuks defeated the Byzantines at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], starting the [[Turkification]] process in the area; the Turkish language and [[Islam]] were introduced to Armenia and Anatolia, gradually spreading throughout the region. The slow transition from a predominantly [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking Anatolia to a predominantly [[Muslim]] and Turkish-speaking one was underway. The [[Mevlevi Order]] of [[dervishes]], which was established in [[Konya]] during the 13th century by [[Sufi]] poet [[Celaleddin Rumi]], played a significant role in the [[Islamization]] of the diverse people of Anatolia who had previously been [[Hellenized]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davison|first1=Roderic H.|title=Essays in Ottoman and Turkish History, 1774–1923: The Impact of the West|date=2013|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-75894-0|pages=3–5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQvUAAAAQBAJ}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Katherine Swynford Lambton|editor1-first=Ann|editor2-last=Lewis|editor2-first=Bernard|title=The Cambridge history of Islam|date=1977|publisher=Cambridge Univ.

In 1243, the Seljuk armies were defeated by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] at the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]], causing the Seljuk Empire's power to slowly disintegrate. In its wake, one of the [[Anatolian beyliks|Turkish principalities]] governed by [[Osman I]] would evolve over the next 200 years into the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In 1514, Sultan [[Selim I]] (1512–1520) successfully expanded the empire's southern and eastern borders by defeating Shah [[Ismail I]] of the [[Safavid dynasty]] in the [[Battle of Chaldiran]]. In 1517, Selim I expanded Ottoman rule into [[Ottoman Algeria|Algeria]] and [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–1517)|Egypt]], and created a naval presence in the [[Red Sea]]. Subsequently, a contest started between the Ottoman and [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] empires to become the dominant sea power in the [[Indian Ocean]], with [[Ottoman naval expeditions in the Indian Ocean|a number of naval battles]] in the Red Sea, the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Persian Gulf]]. The Portuguese presence in the Indian Ocean was perceived as a threat to the Ottoman monopoly over the [[Silk Road|ancient trade routes]] between [[East Asia]] and [[Western Europe]]. Despite the increasingly prominent European presence, the Ottoman Empire's trade with the east continued to flourish until the second half of the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya |editor-last=İnalcık |editor-first=Halil |editor2=Donald Quataert |title=An Economic and Social History of the Ottoman Empire, 1300–1914 |volume=2 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1994 |page=507 |chapter=Crisis and Change, 1590–1699 |isbn=978-0-521-57456-3}}</ref>

The Ottoman Empire's power and prestige peaked in the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], who personally instituted major legislative changes relating to society, education, taxation and criminal law.

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Turkey}}
{{Further|Regions of Turkey|NUTS of Turkey}}

Turkey has a [[unitary state|unitary]] structure in terms of administration and this aspect is one of the most important factors shaping the Turkish public administration. When three powers (executive, legislative and judiciary) are taken into account as the main functions of the state, local administrations have little power. Turkey doesn't have a [[federalism|federal]] system, and the provinces are subordinate to the central government in Ankara. Local administrations were established to provide services in place and the government is represented by the province governors (''vali'') and town governors (''kaymakam''). Other senior public officials are also appointed by the central government instead of the mayors (''belediye başkanı'') or elected by constituents.<ref name=justice.gov.tr>{{cite web|title=General Structure of Turkish Public Administration|url=http://www.justice.gov.tr/judicialsystem.pdf|website=justice.gov.tr/|publisher=Ministry of Justice|access-date=14 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321203401/http://www.justice.gov.tr/judicialsystem.pdf|archivedate=21 March 2015}}</ref> Turkish municipalities have local legislative bodies (''belediye meclisi'') for decision-making on municipal issues.

Within this unitary framework, Turkey is subdivided into 81 [[Provinces of Turkey|provinces]] (''il'' or ''vilayet'') for administrative purposes. Each province is divided into [[Districts of Turkey|districts]] (''ilçe''), for a total of 923 districts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ytr.html|title=Turkey Districts|access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> Turkey is also subdivided into 7 [[Geographical regions of Turkey|regions]] (''bölge'') and 21 subregions for geographic, demographic and economic purposes; this does not refer to an administrative division.

The relatively poor [[Human rights in Turkey|human rights record of Turkey]] has been the subject of much controversy and international condemnation. Between 1998 and 2008 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] made more than 1,600 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations, particularly regarding the right to life, and freedom from torture. Other issues, such as Kurdish rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy.

===Law===
{{Main|Judicial system of Turkey|Law enforcement in Turkey}}
[[Judicial system of Turkey|Turkey's judicial system]] has been wholly integrated with the [[Law in Europe|system of continental Europe]]. For instance, the [[Turkish civil code (1926)|Turkish Civil Code]] has been modified by incorporating elements mainly of the [[Swiss Civil Code]] and [[Swiss Code of Obligations|Code of Obligations]], and the [[Law of Germany|German Commercial Code]]. The Administrative Code bears similarities with its [[Law of France|French counterpart]], and the Penal Code with its [[Italian law codes|Italian counterpart]].<ref name=mymerhaba.com>{{cite web|title=Turkish Legal System|url=http://www.mymerhaba.com/Turkish-Legal-System-in-Turkey-213.html|website=mymerhaba.com/|access-date=14 August 2014}}</ref>

Turkey has adopted the principle of the separation of powers. In line with this principle, judicial power is exercised by independent courts on behalf of the Turkish nation. The independence and organisation of the courts, the security of the tenure of judges and public prosecutors, the profession of judges and prosecutors, the supervision of judges and public prosecutors, the military courts and their organisation, and the powers and duties of the high courts are regulated by the [[Turkish Constitution]].<ref name=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr>{{cite web|title=The Judicial System of Turkey|url=http://www.uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr/THE_JUDICIAL_SYSTEM_OF_TURKEY_AND_ORGANISATION_OF_THE_MINISTRY_OF_JUSTICE.pdf|website=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr/|publisher=Ministry of Justice|access-date=14 August 2014}}</ref>

According to Article 142 of the Turkish Constitution, the organisation, duties and jurisdiction of the courts, their functions and the trial procedures are regulated by law. In line with the aforementioned article of the Turkish Constitution and related laws, the court system in Turkey can be classified under three main categories; which are the Judicial Courts, Administrative Courts and Military Courts. Each category includes first instance courts and high courts. In addition, the Court of Jurisdictional Disputes rules on cases that cannot be classified readily as falling within the purview of one court system.<ref name=uhdigm.adalet.gov.tr />

The European section of Turkey, eastern Thrace ({{lang-tr|trakya}}) is located at the easternmost edge the [[Balkans|Balkan]] peninsula). It forms the border between Turkey and its neighbors Greece and Bulgaria. The Asian part of the country is comprised mostly by the peninsula of Anatolia, which consists of a high central plateau with narrow coastal plains, between the [[Köroğlu Mountains|Köroğlu]] and [[Pontic Mountains|Pontic]] mountain ranges to the north and the [[Taurus Mountains]] to the south. [[Eastern Turkey]] has a more mountainous landscape and is home to the sources of rivers such as the [[Euphrates]], [[Tigris]] and [[Aras River|Aras]].

The uneven north Anatolian terrain running along the Black Sea resembles a long, narrow belt. This region comprises approximately one-sixth of Turkey's total land area. As a general trend, the inland Anatolian plateau becomes increasingly rugged as it progresses eastward.<ref name="TRGeo_TRMinistryTourism">{{cite web |url=http://www.turizm.net/turkey/info/geography.html|title=Geography of Turkey|publisher=Turkish Ministry of Tourism|access-date=13 December 2006|year=2005}}</ref>

Turkey's varied landscapes are the product of complex earth movements that have shaped the region over thousands of years and still manifest themselves in fairly frequent earthquakes and occasional [[volcano|volcanic]] eruptions. The Bosphorus and the Dardanelles owe their existence to the [[geologic fault|fault lines]] running through Turkey that led to the creation of the Black Sea. The [[North Anatolian Fault|North Anatolian Fault Line]] runs across the north of the country from west to east, along which major earthquakes took place in history. The latest of those big earthquakes was the [[1999 İzmit earthquake]].

[[File:Bankalar Caddesi in the 1920's.jpg|thumb|A view of [[Bankalar Caddesi]] (''Banks Street'') in the early years of the Turkish Republic. Completed in 1892, the Ottoman Central Bank headquarters is seen at left. In 1995 the [[Borsa Istanbul|Istanbul Stock Exchange]] moved to [[İstinye]], while numerous Turkish banks moved their headquarters to the central business districts of [[Levent]] and [[Maslak]].]]

In the early decades of the Turkish Republic, the government (or banks established and owned by the government, such as [[Türkiye İş Bankası]] (1924), Sanayi ve Maadin Bankası (1925), Emlak ve Eytam Bankası (1926), [[Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey|Central Bank of Turkey]] (1930), [[Sümerbank]] (1933), [[İlbank|İller Bankası]] (1933), [[Etibank]] (1935), [[Denizbank]] (1937), [[Halk Bankası]] (1938), etc.) had to subsidise most of the industrial projects, due to the lack of a strong [[private sector]]. However, in the period between the 1920s and 1950s, a new generation of Turkish [[entrepreneur]]s such as [[Nuri Demirağ]], [[Vehbi Koç]], [[Hacı Ömer Sabancı]] and [[Nejat Eczacıbaşı]] began to establish privately owned factories, some of which evolved into the largest industrial [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] that dominate the Turkish economy today, such as [[Koç Holding]], [[Sabancı Holding]] and [[Eczacıbaşı|Eczacıbaşı Holding]].
During the first six decades of the republic, between 1923 and 1983, Turkey generally adhered to a quasi-[[statism|statist]] approach with strict government planning of the [[government budget|budget]] and government-imposed limitations over [[foreign trade]], flow of [[foreign exchange market|foreign currency]], foreign direct investment and private sector participation in certain fields (such as [[broadcasting]], [[telecommunications]], [[energy industry|energy]], [[mining]], etc.). However, in 1983, Prime Minister Turgut Özal initiated a series of reforms designed to shift the economy from a statist, insulated system to a more private-sector, [[market economy|market]]-based model.<ref name="80sLiberalization">{{Cite book|title=Economics and Politics of Turkish Liberalization|first=Tevfik F.|last=Nas|publisher=Lehigh University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0-934223-19-5|p=12}}</ref>

<!-- currency and inflation -->
In the early years of the 21st century, the chronically high inflation was brought under control; this led to the launch of a new currency, the [[Turkish lira#8th Emission group|Turkish new lira]] (''Yeni Türk Lirası'') in 2005, to cement the acquisition of the economic reforms and erase the vestiges of an unstable economy.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4137469.stm |title=Turkey knocks six zeros off lira|publisher=BBC|access-date=20 July 2008|date=31 December 2004}}</ref> In 2009, after only four years in circulation, the ''Turkish new lira'' was renamed back to the [[Turkish lira]] with the introduction of [[Turkish lira#9th Emission group|new banknotes]] and [[Turkish Lira#Coins|coins]] (and the withdrawal of the ''Turkish new lira'' banknotes and coins that were introduced in 2005), but the [[ISO 4217]] code of the ''Turkish new lira'' (TRY) remains in use for the current ''Turkish lira'' in the foreign exchange market.

Water supply and sanitation in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water has become almost universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have been created in the 16 [[Metropolitan municipalities in Turkey|metropolitan cities]] of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing the basis for the sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of [[non-revenue water]] hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2&nbsp;billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.<ref name="did-cevreorman17">Ministry of Environment and Forestry: [http://www.did-cevreorman.gov.tr/indir/UCES_ENG.pdf EU Integrated Environmental Approximation Strategy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312222212/http://www.did-cevreorman.gov.tr/indir/UCES_ENG.pdf |date=12 March 2012 }}, 2007, p. 17</ref>

After the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] the number of Muslims in the region that became Turkey increased relative to the Christian population as Ottoman Muslims, who were facing extermination or other forms of repression in the newly constituted Balkan states, emigrated to the country. Not all were ethnic Turks; some were Albanian, Bosnian, Greek, Serbian, Macedonian and Bulgarian. Other Turks and Circassians fleeing Russian expansion in areas like the Caucasus and the Crimea also arrived during this period. By the 1920s, Islam had become the majority religion.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Taylor & Francis| isbn = 978-0-415-36897-1| last = Gülalp| first = Haldun| title = Citizenship and Ethnic Conflict: Challenging the Nation-state| date = 2006| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aps1ruOW0_EC&pg=PA62}}</ref>

[[Turkish carpet|Carpet weaving]] represents a traditional art, dating back to pre-Islamic times. During its long history, the art and craft of the woven carpet has integrated different cultural traditions. Traces of Byzantine design can be detected, [[Turkic peoples]] migrating from Central Asia, as well as Armenian people, Caucasian and Kurdic tribes either living in, or migrating to Anatolia, brought with them their traditional designs. The arrival of Islam and the development of the [[Islamic art]] also influenced Turkish carpet design. The history of its designs, motifs and ornaments thus reflects the political and ethnic history and diversity of the area of Asia minor. However, scientific attempts were unsuccessful, as yet, to attribute a particular design to a specific ethnic, regional, or even nomadic versus village tradition.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Brueggemann |first1=Werner |last2=Boehmer |first2=Harald |title=Teppiche der Bauern und Nomaden in Anatolien = Carpets of the Peasants and Nomads in Anatolia |date=1982 |publisher=Verlag Kunst und Antiquitäten |location=Munich|isbn=978-3-921811-20-7 |pages=34–39 |edition=1st}}</ref>

[[Turkish miniature]] is an art form, which can be linked to the Persian miniature tradition, as well as strong Chinese artistic influences. The words taswir or nakish were used to define the art of miniature painting in Ottoman Turkish. The studios the artists worked in were called Nakkashanes.<ref name="miniature1">{{cite book|last1=Barry|first1=Michael|title=Figurative art in medieval Islam and the riddle of Bihzâd of Herât (1465–1535)|isbn=978-2-08-030421-6|pages=27|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vBIVAQAAIAAJ|access-date=11 February 2017|year=2004}}</ref> The miniatures were usually not signed, perhaps because of the rejection of individualism, but also because the works were not created entirely by one person; the head painter designed the composition of the scene, and his apprentices drew the contours (which were called tahrir) with black or colored ink and then painted the miniature without creating an illusion of third dimension. The head painter, and much more often the scribe of the text, were indeed named and depicted in some of the manuscripts. The understanding of perspective was different from that of the nearby European Renaissance painting tradition, and the scene depicted often included different time periods and spaces in one picture. They followed closely the context of the book they were included in, resembling more illustrations rather than standalone works of art.<ref name="turkishculture.org2">{{cite web|title=Turkish Miniatures|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/traditional-arts/miniatures-563.htm|website=www.turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

The earliest examples of [[Turkish paper marbling]] are thought to be a copy of the Hâlnâme by the poet Arifî. The text of this manuscript was rendered in a delicate cut paper découpage calligraphy by Mehmed bin Gazanfer and completed in 1540, and features many marbled and decorative paper borders. One early master by the name of Şebek is mentioned posthumously in the earliest Ottoman text on the art known as the Tertib-i Risâle-i Ebrî, which is dated based on internal evidence to after 1615. Several recipes in the text are accredited to this master. Another famous 18th-century master by the name of Hatip Mehmed Efendi (died 1773) is accredited with developing motifs and perhaps early floral designs, although evidence from India appears to contradict some of these claims. Despite this, marbled motifs are commonly referred to as "Hatip" designs in Turkey today.<ref name="turkishculture.org3">{{cite web|title=The Turkish Art of Marbling (EBRU)|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/traditional-arts/marbling-113.htm|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

[[Turkish literature]] is a mix of cultural influences. Interaction between the Ottoman Empire and the Islamic world along with Europe contributed to a blend of Turkic, Islamic and European traditions in modern-day Turkish music and literary arts.<ref name=ottomus>{{cite web|title=Ottoman Music|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/music/classical/ottoman-music-474.htm?type=1|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=18 February 2015}}</ref> [[Turkish literature]] was heavily influenced by [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Arabic literature]] during most of the Ottoman era. The [[Tanzimat]] reforms introduced previously unknown Western genres, primarily the novel and the short story. Many of the writers in the Tanzimat period wrote in several genres simultaneously: for instance, the poet [[Namik Kemal|Nâmık Kemal]] also wrote the important 1876 novel ''İntibâh'' (Awakening), while the journalist [[İbrahim Şinasi|Şinasi]] is noted for writing, in 1860, the first modern Turkish play, the [[One act play|one-act]] comedy "''Şair Evlenmesi''" (The Poet's Marriage). Most of the roots of modern Turkish literature were formed between the years 1896 and 1923. Broadly, there were three primary literary movements during this period: the ''Edebiyat-ı Cedîde'' (New Literature) movement; the ''Fecr-i Âtî'' (Dawn of the Future) movement; and the ''Millî Edebiyat'' (National Literature) movement. The first radical step of innovation in 20th century Turkish poetry was taken by [[Nâzım Hikmet Ran|Nâzım Hikmet]], who introduced the [[free verse]] style. Another revolution in Turkish poetry came about in 1941 with the [[Garip]] movement led by [[Orhan Veli Kanık|Orhan Veli]], [[Oktay Rıfat Horozcu|Oktay Rıfat]] and [[Melih Cevdet Anday|Melih Cevdet]]. The mix of cultural influences in Turkey is dramatised, for example, in the form of the "new symbols of the clash and interlacing of cultures" enacted in the novels of [[Orhan Pamuk]], recipient of the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6044192.stm|title=Pamuk wins Nobel Literature prize|publisher=BBC|access-date=12 December 2006|date=12 October 2006}}</ref>

The origin of [[Turkish theatre]] dates back thousands of years to ancient pagan rituals. The dances, music and songs performed during the rituals of the inhabitants of Anatolia millennia ago are the elements from which the first shows originated. These rituals later became theatrical shows. In the 10th century, a blend of traditions occurred between the Seljuk Turks and those of the inhabitants of Anatolia. The interaction between the various tribal societies paved the way for new plays.

After the [[Tanzimat]] (Reformation) period in the 19th century, characters in Turkish theatre were modernized and plays were performed on European-style stages with the actors wearing European costumes. Following the [[Second Constitutional Era|restoration of constitutional monarchy]] with the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, theatrical activities increased and social problems began to be reflected in the theatre as well as in historical plays. A theatrical conservatoire, Darülbedayi-i Osmani, was established in Istanbul in 1914. During the years of chaos and war, the Darülbedayi-i Osmani continued its activities and attracted the younger generation. Turkish playwrights emerged. Some wrote on romantic subjects, others were interested in social problems and still others dealt with nationalistic themes. There were even those who wrote musicals. In time, Turkish women began to appear on stage and this was indeed a revolution of the time, since female roles had only been played by actresses who were members of Turkey's ethnic minorities. Today, theatre acts are performed by numerous private theatre companies and subsidized companies such as the [[Turkish State Theatres]].<ref name="turkishculture.org4">{{cite web|title=Traditional Theatre|url=http://www.turkishculture.org/performing-arts/theatre-36.htm|website=turkishculture.org|access-date=11 February 2017}}</ref>

===Music and dance===

{{see also|Turkish classical music|Turkish folk music|Turkish music (style)}}[[Music of Turkey]] includes mainly [[Turkic culture|Turkic]] elements as well as partial influences ranging from [[Music of Central Asia|Central Asian folk music]], [[Arabic music]], [[Greek music]], [[Ottoman music]], [[Persian traditional music|Persian music]] and [[Music of Southeastern Europe|Balkan music]], as well as references to more modern European and [[Music of the United States|American]] [[popular music]]. The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries to a time when the [[Seljuk Turks]] migrated to [[Anatolia]] and [[Persia]] in the 11th century and contains elements of both Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for [[Westernization]].<ref name="soundsofanatolia">{{cite book|author=Stokes, Martin|title=Sounds of Anatolia|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2000|isbn=978-1-85828-636-5}}, pp. 396–410.</ref>

With the assimilation of immigrants from various regions the diversity of musical genres and musical instrumentation also expanded. Turkey has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of [[Music of Greece|Greek]], [[Music of Armenia|Armenian]], [[Music of Albania|Albanian]], [[Music of Poland|Polish]] and [[Jewish]] communities, among others.<ref name="lesartsturcs">{{cite web|url=http://www.lesartsturcs.com/|title=History of music in Turkey|work=Les Arts Turcs |date=1 May 1999}}</ref>

Many Turkish cities and towns have vibrant local music scenes which, in turn, support a number of regional musical styles. Despite this however, western-style music styles like [[pop music]] and [[Kanto (music)|kanto]] lost popularity to [[arabesque]] in the late 70s and 80s. It became popular again by the beginning of the 1990s, as a result of an opening economy and society. With the support of [[Sezen Aksu]], the resurging popularity of pop music gave rise to several international Turkish pop stars such as [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]] and [[Sertab Erener]]. The late 1990s also saw an emergence of underground music producing alternative [[Turkish rock music|Turkish rock]], [[electronica]], [[Turkish hip hop|hip-hop]], [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[dance music]] in opposition to the mainstream corporate [[pop music|pop]] and [[Arabesque music|arabesque]] genres, which many believe have become too commercial.<ref name="musicscene">{{cite web|url=http://tarkandeluxe.blogspot.com/2006/02/istanbul-music-scene.html|title=Istanbul Music Scene|work=Yildirim, Ali.

The transition from Seljuk architecture to [[Ottoman architecture]] is most visible in [[Bursa]], which was the capital of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman State]] between 1335 and 1413. Following the [[Fall of Constantinople|Ottoman conquest of Constantinople (Istanbul)]] in 1453, Ottoman architecture was significantly influenced by [[Byzantine architecture]]. [[Topkapı Palace]] in Istanbul is one of the most famous examples of classical Ottoman architecture and was the primary residence of the [[Ottoman Sultan]]s for approximately 400 years.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/08/22/travel/center-of-ottoman-power.html|title=Center of Ottoman Power|work=New York Times|last=Simons|first=Marlise|access-date=4 June 2009|date=22 August 1993}}</ref> [[Mimar Sinan]] (c.1489–1588) was the most important architect of the classical period in Ottoman architecture. He was the chief architect of at least 374 buildings which were constructed in various [[eyalet|provinces]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cadde.milliyet.com.tr/2013/12/30/HaberDetay/1656832/iSTANBUL_A_iMZASINI_ATTI|title=A list of the buildings designed by Mimar Sinan|access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref>

Since the 18th century, Turkish architecture has been increasingly influenced by European styles, and this can be particularly seen in the [[Tanzimat]] era buildings of Istanbul like the [[Dolmabahçe Palace|Dolmabahçe]], [[Çırağan Palace|Çırağan]], [[Feriye Sarayları|Feriye]], [[Beylerbeyi Palace|Beylerbeyi]], [[Küçüksu Palace|Küçüksu]], [[Ihlamur Palace|Ihlamur]] and [[Yıldız Palace|Yıldız]] [[palace]]s, which were all designed by members of the [[Balyan family]] of Ottoman court architects.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Ottoman Architecture|first=Godfrey|last=Goodwin|publisher=Thames & Hudson|year=2003|isbn=978-0-500-27429-3|url=}}</ref> The Ottoman era [[yalı|waterfront houses (''yalı'')]] on the [[Bosphorus]] also reflect the fusion between classical Ottoman and European architectural styles during the aforementioned period. The [[First National Architectural Movement]] (''Birinci Ulusal Mimarlık Akımı'') in the early 20th century sought to create a new architecture, which was based on motifs from Seljuk and Ottoman architecture. The movement was also labelled ''Turkish Neoclassical'' or the ''National Architectural Renaissance''.<ref name="First">{{cite web|url=http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/Photo_6_1_the-search-for-identity-1st-national-architecture-movement.html |title=The Search for Identity: 1st National Architecture Movement |publisher=ArchMuseum.org |access-date=20 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913161900/http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/Photo_6_1_the-search-for-identity-1st-national-architecture-movement.html |archivedate=13 September 2011  }}</ref> The leading architects of this movement were [[Vedat Tek]] (1873–1942), [[Mimar Kemaleddin Bey]] (1870–1927), [[Arif Hikmet Koyunoğlu]] (1888–1982) and Giulio Mongeri (1873–1953).<ref name=turkisharch>{{cite web|title=Turkish Architecture in the Republican Period |url=http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/turkish-architecture-in-the-republican-period_6.html |website=archmuseum.org |access-date=18 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318163506/http://www.archmuseum.org/Gallery/turkish-architecture-in-the-republican-period_6.html |archivedate=18 March 2015  }}</ref> Notable buildings from this era are the [[Istanbul Main Post Office|Grand Post Office]] in Istanbul (1905–1909), [[Tayyare Apartments]] (1919–1922),<ref name="tayyare">{{cite web|url=http://www.atelyemim.com/mimari/ramada_eng.html|title=Tayyare Apartment Building|publisher =AtelyeMim.com|access-date=2 February 2012}}</ref> [[Istanbul 4th Vakıf Han]] (1911–1926),<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/7839332|publisher=Yıldız Teknik Üniversitesi-Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü|title=XIX.

Turkish cuisine is largely the heritage of [[Ottoman cuisine]]. In the early years of the Republic, a few studies were published about regional Anatolian dishes but cuisine did not feature heavily in Turkish folkloric studies until the 1980s, when the fledgling tourism industry encouraged the Turkish state to sponsor two food symposia. The papers submitted at the symposia presented the history of Turkish cuisine on a "historical continuum" that dated back to Turkic origins in Central Asia and continued through the Seljuk and Ottoman periods.<ref name=berg>{{Cite book| publisher = Berg| isbn = 978-0-85785-217-5| last1 = Claflin| first1 = Kyri W.| last2 = Scholliers| first2 = Peter| title = Writing Food History: A Global Perspective| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7WUDAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA1980 |year=2013}}</ref>

Many of the papers presented at these first two symposia were unreferenced. Prior to the symposia, the study of Turkish culinary culture was first popularized by the publication of Süheyl Ünver's ''Fifty Dishes in Turkish History'' in 1948. This book was based on recipes found in an 18th century Ottoman manuscript. His second book was about palace cuisine during the reign of [[Mehmet II]]. Following the publication of Ünver's book subsequent studies were published, including a 1978 study by a historian named Bahaettin Ögel about the [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] origins of Turkish cuisine.<ref name=berg />

Ottoman cuisine was influenced by [[Balkan cuisine|Balkan]], [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]], [[Kurdish cuisine|Kurdish]], [[Persian cuisine|Persian]] and [[Armenian cuisine]]s.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-61069-389-9| last = Kia| first = Mehrdad| title = The Ottoman Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes]|year=2017|ref=https://books.google.com/books?id=UgUmDwAAQBAJ&pg=RA1-PA4}}</ref> The country's position between the East and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s six hundred-year reign. [[Yogurt]] salads, fish in [[olive oil]], [[sharbat|sherbet]] and [[dolma|stuffed and wrapped vegetables]] became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to [[northern Africa]], used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.<ref name="foodbycountry.com">{{cite web|title=Food in Turkey – Turkish Food, Turkish Cuisine |url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Spain-to-Zimbabwe-Cumulative-Index/Turkey.html|website=foodbycountry.com|access-date=12 August 2014}}</ref>

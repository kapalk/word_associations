'''Guatemala''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Guatemala.ogg|ˌ|ɡ|w|ɑː|t|ə|ˈ|m|ɑː|l|ə}} {{respell|GWAH|tə|MAH|lə}}; {{IPA-es|gwateˈmala|lang}}), officially the '''Republic of Guatemala''' ({{lang-es|República de Guatemala|links=no}}),<!-- {{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðe ɣwateˈmala}} --> is a country in [[Central America]] bordered by [[Mexico]] to the north and west, [[Belize]] and the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] to the northeast, [[Honduras]] to the east, [[El Salvador]] to the southeast and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south. With an estimated population of around {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Guatemala}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million,{{UN_Population|ref}} it is the most populated country in Central America. Guatemala is a [[representative democracy]]; its capital and largest city is Nueva Guatemala de la Asunción, also known as [[Guatemala City]].

The territory of modern Guatemala once formed the core of the [[Maya civilization]], which extended across [[Mesoamerica]]. Most of the country was [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquered by the Spanish]] in the 16th century, becoming part of the [[viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]]. Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which dissolved by 1841.

From the mid to late 19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the [[United Fruit Company]] and the United States government. In 1944, authoritarian leader [[Jorge Ubico]] was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a [[Guatemalan Revolution|decade-long revolution]] that led to sweeping social and economic reforms. A [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|U.S.-backed military coup]] in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship.{{sfn|Blakeley|2009|p=92}}

From 1960 to 1996, Guatemala [[Guatemalan Civil War|endured a bloody civil war]] fought between the US-backed government and [[leftist]] rebels, including [[Guatemalan genocide|genocidal massacres]] of the Maya population perpetrated by the military.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=171}}{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=3–15}}{{sfn|Navarro|1999}} Since a [[United Nations]]-negotiated peace accord, Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections, though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, crime, drug trade, and instability. {{as of|2014}}, Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128091411/http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|archive-date=28 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Guatemala's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes a large number of endemic species and contributes to [[Mesoamerica]]'s designation as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].{{sfn|Conservation International|2007|p=}}

== Etymology ==
The name "Guatemala" comes from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''Cuauhtēmallān'' [[:nah:Cuauhtēmallān|(nahwiki)]], or "place of many trees", a derivative of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Mayan]] word for "many trees"{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=}}{{sfn|Troika study abroad programs|2006|p=}} or perhaps more specifically for the Cuate/Cuatli tree [[Eysenhardtia]]. This was the name the [[Tlaxcala|Tlaxcaltecan]] soldiers who accompanied [[Pedro de Alvarado]] during the [[Spanish Conquest]] gave to this territory.{{sfn|Rain Forest Wordpress|2013|p=}}

== History ==
{{Main|History of Guatemala}}

=== Pre-Columbian ===
The first evidence of human habitation in Guatemala dates back to 12,000 BC. Evidence, such as [[obsidian]] [[arrowhead]]s found in various parts of the country, suggests a human presence as early as 18,000 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.authenticmaya.com/ancient_guatemala.htm |title=Ancient Guatemala |publisher=Authentic Maya |author=Mary Esquivel de Villalobos |accessdate=29 April 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523103423/http://www.authenticmaya.com/ancient_guatemala.htm |archivedate=23 May 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> There is archaeological proof that early Guatemalan settlers were [[hunter-gatherers]]. Pollen samples from [[Petén Basin|Petén]] and the Pacific coast indicate that [[maize]] cultivation had developed by 3500 BC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ess.geology.ufl.edu/hodell/ICDP/Leyden.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206082017/http://ess.geology.ufl.edu/hodell/ICDP/Leyden.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2009 |publisher=University of Florida |title=Pollen Evidence for Climatic Variability and Cultural Disturbance in the Maya Lowlands |author=Barbara Leyden |format=PDF}}</ref> Sites dating back to 6500 BC have been found in the [[Quiché department|Quiché]] region in the Highlands, and [[Sipacate]] and [[Escuintla]] on the central Pacific coast.

Archaeologists divide the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] history of Mesoamerica into the Preclassic period (2999 BC to 250 AD), the Classic period (250 to 900 AD), and the Postclassic period (900 to 1500 AD).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/mexchron.html |title=Chronological Table of Mesoamerican Archaeology |publisher=Regents of the University of California : Division of Social Sciences |accessdate=29 April 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406020436/http://weber.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/mexchron.html |archive-date=6 April 2007 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Until recently, the Preclassic was regarded as a formative period, with small villages of farmers who lived in huts, and few permanent buildings. However, this notion has been challenged by recent discoveries of monumental architecture from that period, such as an altar in [[La Blanca]], [[San Marcos department|San Marcos]], from 1000 BC; ceremonial sites at Miraflores and [[Naranjo]] from 801 BC; the earliest monumental masks; and the [[Mirador Basin]] cities of [[Nakbé]], Xulnal, [[El Tintal]], Wakná and [[El Mirador]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The Classic period of [[Mesoamerican]] civilization corresponds to the height of the [[Maya civilization]], and is represented by countless sites throughout Guatemala, although the largest concentration is in [[Petén Basin|Petén]]. This period is characterized by urbanisation, the emergence of independent city-states, and contact with other Mesoamerican cultures.<ref>

Their cities preserved many aspects of Maya culture.
The Maya civilization shares many features with other Mesoamerican civilizations due to the high degree of interaction and [[cultural diffusion]] that characterized the region. Advances such as writing, [[epigraphy]], and the [[Maya calendar|calendar]] did not originate with the Maya; however, their civilization fully developed them. Maya influence can be detected from [[Honduras]], Guatemala, Northern [[El Salvador]] to as far north as central Mexico, more than {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Geography of Mesoamerica#Maya Region|Maya area]]. Many outside influences are found in [[Maya art]] and architecture, which are thought to be the result of trade and cultural exchange rather than direct external conquest.

=== Colonial era (1519–1821) ===

After they arrived in the [[New World]], the Spanish started several expeditions to Guatemala, beginning in 1519. Before long, Spanish contact resulted in an epidemic that devastated native populations. [[Hernán Cortés]], who had led the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]], granted a permit to Captains Gonzalo de Alvarado and his brother, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], to conquer this land. Alvarado at first allied himself with the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel nation]] to fight against their traditional rivals the [[K'iche' kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche' (Quiché) nation]]. Alvarado later turned against the Kaqchikel, and eventually brought the entire region under Spanish domination.<ref>[http://www.lienzo.ufm.edu/cms/en/home Lienzo de Quauhquechollan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724103204/http://www.lienzo.ufm.edu/cms/en/home |date=24 July 2009 }} digital map exhibition on the History of the conquest of Guatemala.</ref>

During the colonial period, Guatemala was an [[Audiencia Real|audiencia]], a [[Captaincy|captaincy-general]] (''[[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Capitanía General de Guatemala]]'') of Spain, and a part of [[New Spain]] (Mexico).{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=69–71}} The first capital, Villa de Santiago de Guatemala (now known as [[Tecpan Guatemala]]), was founded on 25 July 1524 near [[Iximché]], the Kaqchikel capital city. The capital was moved to [[Ciudad Vieja]] on 22 November 1527, as a result of a Kaqchikel attack on Villa de Santiago de Guatemala.

On 11 September 1541, the new capital was flooded when the lagoon in the [[Volcanic crater|crater]] of the [[Volcán de Agua|Agua Volcano]] collapsed due to heavy rains and earthquakes; the capital was then moved {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} to [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]] in the Panchoy Valley, now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. This city was destroyed by several earthquakes in 1773–1774. The King of Spain authorized moving the capital to its current location in the Ermita Valley, which is named after a [[Catholic church]] dedicated to the [[Virgin Mary|Virgen del Carmen]]. This new capital was founded on 2 January 1776.

=== Independence and the 19th century (1821–1847) ===
[[File:Independenciacentroamerica2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Criollo people|Criollos]] rejoice upon learning about the declaration of independence from Spain on 15 September 1821.]]

On 15 September 1821, the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]], formed by [[Chiapas]], Guatemala, [[El Salvador]], Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Honduras, officially proclaimed its independence from Spain. The Captaincy-general was dissolved two years later.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=134–136}} This region was formally a part of the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]] throughout the colonial period, but as a practical matter had been administered separately. It was not until 1825 that Guatemala created its own flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guatemalago.com/en/home/flag |title=Flag |publisher=Guatemala Go |date= |accessdate=22 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926191709/http://www.guatemalago.com/en/home/flag |archivedate=26 September 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 1838 the liberal forces of Honduran leader [[Francisco Morazán]] and of Guatemalan [[José Francisco Barrundia]] invaded Guatemala and reached San Sur, where they executed Chúa Alvarez, father-in-law of [[Rafael Carrera]], then a military commander and later the first president of Guatemala. The liberal forces impaled Alvarez's head on a pike as a warning to followers of the Guatemalan [[caudillo]].{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 84-85}} Carrera and his wife Petrona – who had come to confront Morazán as soon as they learned of the invasion and were in [[Mataquescuintla]] – swore they would never forgive Morazán even in his grave; they felt it impossible to respect anyone who would not avenge family members.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p = 85}}

After sending several envoys, whom Carrera would not receive – and especially not Barrundia whom Carrera did not want to murder in cold blood – Morazán began a scorched-earth offensive, destroying villages in his path and stripping them of assets. The Carrera forces had to hide in the mountains.{{sfn |González Davison|2008|p=86}} Believing Carrera totally defeated, Morazán and Barrundia marched to [[Guatemala City]], and were welcomed as saviors by state governor [[Pedro Valenzuela]] and members of the conservative {{ILL|Aycinena clan|es|Clan Aycinena}}, who proposed to sponsor one of the liberal battalions, while Valenzuela and Barrundia gave Morazán all the Guatemalan resources needed to solve any financial problem he had.{{sfn|González Davison |2008 |p = 87}} The [[criollo people|criollos]] of both parties celebrated until dawn that they finally had a criollo caudillo like Morazán, who was able to crush the peasant rebellion.{{sfn|González Davison|2008 |p = 88}}

[[File:Political Evolution of Central America and the Caribbean 1830 na.png|thumb|The [[Federal Republic of Central America]] (1823–1838) with its capital in Guatemala City.]]
Morazán used the proceeds to support Los Altos and then replaced Valenzuela with [[Mariano Rivera Paz]], a member of the Aycinena clan, although he did not return to that clan any property confiscated in 1829. In revenge, [[Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol]] voted to dissolve the [[Central American Federation]] in [[San Salvador]] a little later, forcing Morazán to return to El Salvador to fight for his federal mandate. Along the way, Morazán increased repression in eastern Guatemala, as punishment for helping Carrera.{{Sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 89}} Knowing that Morazán had gone to El Salvador, Carrera tried to take [[Salamá]] with the small force that remained, but was defeated, and lost his brother Laureano in combat. With just a few men left, he managed to escape, badly wounded, to [[Sanarate]].{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 91-92}} After recovering somewhat, he attacked a detachment in [[Jutiapa]] and got a small amount of booty which he gave to the volunteers who accompanied him. He then prepared to attack [[Petapa]] near Guatemala City, where he was victorious, although with heavy casualties.{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 92}}

In September of that year, Carrera attempted an assault on the capital of Guatemala, but the liberal general [[Carlos Salazar Castro]] defeated him in the fields of [[Villa Nueva, Guatemala|Villa Nueva]] and Carrera had to retreat.{{sfn |Hernández de León |1959 |p =20 April}} After unsuccessfully trying to take [[Quetzaltenango]], Carrera found himself both surrounded and wounded. He had to capitulate to Mexican General [[Agustin Guzman]], who had been in Quetzaltenango since [[Vicente Filísola]]'s arrival in 1823. Morazán had the opportunity to shoot Carrera, but did not, because he needed the support of the Guatemalan peasants to counter the attacks of [[Francisco Ferrera]] in [[El Salvador]]. Instead, Morazán left Carrera in charge of a small fort in Mita, without any weapons. Knowing that Morazán was going to attack El Salvador, [[Francisco Ferrera]] gave arms and ammunition to Carrera and convinced him to attack Guatemala City.{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |p = 96}}

Meanwhile, despite insistent advice to definitively crush Carrera and his forces, Salazar tried to negotiate with him diplomatically; he even went as far as to show that he neither feared nor distrusted Carrera by removing the fortifications of the Guatemalan capital, in place since the battle of Villa Nueva.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p =20 April}} Taking advantage of Salazar's good faith and Ferrera's weapons, Carrera took Guatemala City by surprise on 13 April 1839; Salazar, [[Mariano Gálvez]] and Barrundia fled before the arrival of Carrera's militia men. Salazar, in his nightshirt, vaulted roofs of neighboring houses and sought refuge,{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p=48}}{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=122–127}} reaching the border disguised as a peasant.{{Sfn|Hernández de León|1959|p =48}}{{sfn |González Davison |2008 |pp = 122–127}} With Salazar gone, Carrera reinstated Rivera Paz as head of state.

Between 1838 and 1840 a [[Los Altos, Central America|secessionist movement]] in the city of [[Quetzaltenango]] founded the breakaway state of [[Los Altos (country)|Los Altos]] and sought independence from Guatemala. The most important members of the Liberal Party of Guatemala and liberal enemies of the conservative régime moved to Los Altos, leaving their exile in El Salvador.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959 |p =?}} The liberals in Los Altos began severely criticizing the Conservative government of Rivera Paz.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959 |p =?}} Los Altos was the region with the main production and economic activity of the former state of Guatemala. Without Los Altos, conservatives lost many of the resources that had given Guatemala hegemony in Central America.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1959 |p =?}} The government of Guatemala tried to reach to a peaceful solution, but two years of bloody conflict followed.

In 1840, Belgium began to act as an external source of support for Carrera's independence movement, in an effort to exert influence in Central America. The ''Compagnie belge de colonisation'' (Belgian Colonization Company), commissioned by Belgian King [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], became the administrator of [[Santo Tomas de Castilla]]{{sfn|Compagnie Belge de Colonisation|1844|p=}} replacing the failed British [[Eastern Coast of Central America Commercial and Agricultural Company]].{{sfn|Compagnie Belge de Colonisation|1844|p=}} Even though the colony eventually crumbled, Belgium continued to support Carrera in the mid-19th century, although Britain continued to be the main business and political partner to Carrera's regime.{{sfn|Woodward|1993|p=498}} Rafael Carrera was elected Guatemalan Governor in 1844.

[[German Guatemalan|Settlers from Germany arrived in the mid-19th century]]. German settlers acquired land and grew coffee plantations in Alta Verapaz and Quetzaltenango.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

=== Republic (1847–1851) ===
On 21 March 1847, Guatemala declared itself an independent republic and Carrera became its first president.

[[File:Guatemala Real 1847 Silver Coin Fonrobert 7236.jpg|thumb|Proclamation Coin 1847 of the independent Republic of Guatemala]]

During the first term as president, Carrera brought the country back from extreme conservatism to a traditional moderation; in 1848, the liberals were able to drive him from office, after the country had been in turmoil for several months.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}{{sfn|Miceli|1974|p=72}} Carrera resigned of his own free will and left for México. The new liberal regime allied itself with the Aycinena family and swiftly passed a law ordering Carrera's execution if he returned to Guatemalan soil.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}}

The liberal criollos from [[Quetzaltenango]] were led by general [[Agustín Guzmán]] who occupied the city after Corregidor general [[Mariano Paredes (Guatemala)|Mariano Paredes]] was called to [[Guatemala City]] to take over the presidential office.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=270}} They declared on 26 August 1848 that Los Altos was an independent state once again. The new state had the support of [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]]' régime in [[El Salvador]] and the rebel guerrilla army of Vicente and Serapio Cruz, who were sworn enemies of Carrera.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|pp=270–271}} The interim government was led by Guzmán himself and had Florencio Molina and the priest Fernando Davila as his Cabinet members.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=271}} On 5 September 1848, the criollos altenses chose a formal government led by Fernando Antonio Martínez.

In the meantime, Carrera decided to return to Guatemala and did so, entering at [[Huehuetenango]], where he met with native leaders and told them that they must remain united to prevail; the leaders agreed and slowly the segregated native communities started developing a new Indian identity under Carrera's leadership.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} In the meantime, in the eastern part of Guatemala, the [[Jalapa]] region became increasingly dangerous; former president [[Mariano Rivera Paz]] and rebel leader Vicente Cruz were both murdered there after trying to take over the Corregidor office in 1849.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

When Carrera arrived to [[Chiantla]] in [[Huehuetenango]], he received two altenses emissaries who told him that their soldiers were not going to fight his forces because that would lead to a native revolt, much like that of 1840; their only request from Carrera was to keep the natives under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}} The altenses did not comply, and led by Guzmán and his forces, they started chasing Carrera; the caudillo hid, helped by his native allies and remained under their protection when the forces of [[Miguel Garcia Granados]] arrived from [[Guatemala City]] looking for him.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=275}}

On learning that officer [[José Víctor Zavala]] had been appointed as Corregidor in [[Suchitepéquez]], Carrera and his hundred [[jakaltek people|jacalteco]] bodyguards crossed a dangerous jungle infested with [[jaguar]]s to meet his former friend. Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts – Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in [[Suchitepéquez]] as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=}} Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}}

Guzmán went to [[Antigua Guatemala]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzmán defeat his enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzmán was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when in his absence Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]] and convinced him that he should work with the K'iche', Q'anjobal and [[Mam people|Mam]] leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}} On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: "Now he is the king of the Indians, indeed!"{{sfn|González Davison|2008|p=280}}

Guzmán then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced President Paredes to deal with Carrera. Back in Guatemala City within a few months, Carrera was commander-in-chief, backed by military and political support of the Indian communities from the densely populated western highlands.{{sfn|Weaver|1999|p=138}} During the first presidency, from 1844 to 1848, he brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a moderate regime, and – with the advice of Juan José de Aycinena y Piñol and [[Pedro de Aycinena]] – restored relations with the Church in Rome with a [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat]] ratified in 1854.{{sfn|Calvert|1985|p=36}}

=== Second Carrera government (1851–1865) ===
[[File:Carrerayturcios 2014-06-22 09-46.jpg|thumb|Captain General [[Rafael Carrera]] after being appointed President for Life in 1854.]]

After Carrera returned from exile in 1849 the president of El Salvador, [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]], granted asylum to the Guatemalan liberals, who harassed the Guatemalan government in several different ways. José Francisco Barrundia established a liberal newspaper for that specific purpose. Vasconcelos supported a rebel faction named "La Montaña" in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hernández de León|1930|p=}} In 1851 Guatemala defeated an Allied army from Honduras and El Salvador at the [[Battle of La Arada]].

In 1854 Carrera was declared "supreme and perpetual leader of the nation" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He held that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency.

His rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the [[Clerical Party]], and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.

The Marshall called himself President of the Republic, but in reality he was the foreman of oppressed and savaged people, cowardly enough that they had not dared to tell the dictator to leave threatening him with a revolution.}}

The State and Church were a single unit, and the conservative régime was strongly allied to the power of [[regular clergy]] of the [[Catholic Church]], who were then among the largest landowners in Guatemala. The tight relationship between church and state had been ratified by the [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat of 1852]], which was the law until Cerna was deposed in 1871.{{sfn|Aycinena|1854|p=2–16}} Even liberal generals like {{ILL|Serapio Cruz|es}} realized that Rafael Carrera's political and military presence made him practically invincible.

In 1871, the merchants guild, Consulado de Comercio, lost their exclusive court privilege. They had major effects on the economics of the time, and therefore land management. From 1839 to 1871, the Consulado held a consistent monopolistic position in the regime.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/804741468045832887/pdf/28989.pdf|title=Inequality in Latin America: Breaking with History?|last=de Ferranti|first=David|publisher=World Bank|year=2004|isbn=|location=Washington DC, USA|pages=109–122|access-date=10 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818104239/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/804741468045832887/pdf/28989.pdf|archive-date=18 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Liberal governments (1871–1898) ===
{{Further|Justo Rufino Barrios}}
Guatemala's "Liberal Revolution" came in 1871 under the leadership of [[Justo Rufino Barrios]], who worked to modernize the country, improve trade, and introduce new crops and manufacturing. During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173–175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.

[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[José María Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicapán indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him. Reyna was elected president. {{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p = 82}}

[[José María Reina Barrios]] was President between 1892 and 1898. During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[Guatemala City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first "[[Exposición Centroamericana]]" ("Central American Fair") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.

His administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[Panama Canal]] was not built yet.

=== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898–1920) ===
{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}

[[File:Manuel Estrada Cabrera.jpg|thumb|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ruled Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]
After the assassination of general [[José María Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the Presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting "with pistol drawn" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=42}}

The first civilian Guatemalan head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the Legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}

One of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the Guatemalan economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=}}

Estrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies. One American ambassador returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President [[Manuel Barillas]] was stabbed to death in Mexico City. Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers' strikes against UFCO. In one incident, when UFCO went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter a workers' compound. The forces "arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers' sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number."{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}}

In 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Arévalo Martinez|1945|p=146}}

[[Guatemala City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917 Guatemala earthquake]].

Estrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed Carlos Herrera in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}

=== Jorge Ubico regime (1931–1944) ===
{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}
The [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the Guatemalan economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the Guatemalan landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for "efficiency and cruelty" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12–15}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10–11}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid Indian labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29–32}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}

Ubico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the [[United Fruit Company]], often at a cost to Guatemala. He granted the company {{convert|200,000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into Guatemala, the United Fruit Company had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s. This process accelerated under Ubico's presidency, with the government doing nothing to stop it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=19}} The company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other individual or group. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at [[Puerto Barrios]] on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67–71}}

Ubico saw the United States as an ally against the supposed communist threat of Mexico, and made efforts to gain its support. When the US declared war against Germany in 1941, Ubico acted on American instructions and arrested all people in Guatemala of [[German Guatemalan|German descent]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=20}} He also permitted the US to establish an air base in Guatemala, with the stated aim of protecting the [[Panama Canal]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=37}} However, Ubico was an admirer of European [[fascist]]s, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]],{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=19}} and considered himself to be "another [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]".{{sfn|De los Ríos|1948|p=98}} He occasionally compared himself to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Shillington|2002|pp=38–39}} He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances. He militarized numerous political and social institutions—including the post office, schools, and symphony orchestras—and placed military officers in charge of many government posts.{{sfn|Streeter2000|p=11–12}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=32}}{{sfn|Grandin|2000|p=195}}{{sfn|Benz|1996|p=16–17}}{{sfn|Loveman|Davies|1997|p=118–120}}

On 1 July 1944 Ubico was forced to resign from the presidency in response to a wave of protests and a [[general strike]] inspired by brutal labor conditions among plantation workers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Forster|first=Cindy|title=The Time of "Freedom": San Marcos Coffee Workers and the Radicalization of the Guatemalan National Revolution, 1944–1954|journal=Radical History Review|year=1994|volume=58|pages=35–78|doi=10.1215/01636545-1994-58-35}}</ref> His chosen replacement, General [[Juan Federico Ponce Vaides]], was forced out of office on 20 October 1944 by a [[coup d'état]] led by Major [[Francisco Javier Arana]] and Captain [[Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán]].

=== Coup and civil war (1954–1996) ===
{{Main|1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|Guatemalan Civil War}}
{{see also|United States involvement in regime change}}
Despite their popularity within the country, the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution were disliked by the United States government, which was predisposed by the [[Cold War]] to see it as communist, and the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO), whose hugely profitable business had been affected by the end to brutal labor practices.{{sfn|Streeter|2000|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=48–50}} The attitude of the U.S. government was also influenced by a propaganda campaign carried out by the UFCO.{{sfn|Paterson|2009|p=304}}

U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] authorized [[Operation PBFORTUNE]] to topple Árbenz in 1952, with the support of Nicaraguan dictator [[Anastasio Somoza García]],{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}} but the operation was aborted when too many details became public.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|p=102}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=228–231}} [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] was elected U.S. President in 1952, promising to take a harder line against communism; the close links that his staff members [[John Foster Dulles]] and [[Allen Dulles]] had to the UFCO also predisposed him to act against Árbenz.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=122–127}} Eisenhower authorized the CIA to carry out Operation PBSUCCESS in August 1953. The CIA armed, funded, and trained a force of 480 men led by [[Carlos Castillo Armas]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=171–175}} The force invaded Guatemala on 18 June 1954, backed by a heavy campaign of [[psychological warfare]], including bombings of [[Guatemala City]] and an anti-Árbenz radio station claiming to be genuine news.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=161–170}} The invasion force fared poorly militarily, but the psychological warfare and the possibility of a U.S. invasion intimidated the Guatemalan army, which refused to fight. Árbenz resigned on 27 June.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}}{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=190–204}}

Following negotiations in [[San Salvador]], Carlos Castillo Armas became President on 7 July 1954.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties were barred from participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate and won the election with 99% of the vote.{{sfn|Immerman|1982|pp=173–178}} Castillo Armas reversed [[Decree 900]] and ruled until 26 July 1957, when he was assassinated by Romeo Vásquez, a member of his personal guard. After the rigged<ref name="Chomsky 1985 154–160" /> election that followed, General [[José Miguel Ramón Ydígoras Fuentes|Miguel Ydígoras Fuentes]] assumed power. He is celebrated for challenging the Mexican president to a gentleman's [[duel]] on the bridge on the south border to end a feud on the subject of illegal fishing by Mexican boats on Guatemala's Pacific coast, two of which were sunk by the Guatemalan Air Force. Ydigoras authorized the training of 5,000 anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] [[Cubans]] in Guatemala. He also provided airstrips in the region of [[Petén (department)|Petén]] for what later became the US-sponsored, failed [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961. Ydigoras' government was ousted in 1963 when the Guatemalan Air Force attacked several military bases; the coup was led by his Defense Minister, Colonel [[Enrique Peralta Azurdia]].

In 1963, the junta called an election, which permitted Arevalo to return from exile and run. However a coup from within the military, backed by the [[Kennedy Administration]], prevented the election from taking place, and forestalled a likely victory for Arevalo. The new régime intensified the campaign of terror against the guerrillas that had begun under Ydígoras-Fuentes.<ref>{{cite book|last=McClintock|first=Michael|title=American Connection|year=1987}}</ref>

In 1966, [[Julio César Méndez Montenegro]] was elected president of Guatemala under the banner "Democratic Opening". Mendez Montenegro was the candidate of the Revolutionary Party, a center-left party that had its origins in the post-Ubico era. During this time rightist [[paramilitary]] organizations, such as the "White Hand" (''[[Mano Blanca]]''), and the Anticommunist Secret Army (''Ejército Secreto Anticomunista'') were formed. Those groups were the forerunners of the infamous "[[Death squad|Death Squads]]". Military advisers from the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|United States Army Special Forces]] (Green Berets) were sent to Guatemala to train these troops and help transform the army into a modern counter-insurgency force, which eventually made it the most sophisticated in Central America.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=Turning the Tide|year=1985|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}</ref>

In 1970, Colonel [[Carlos Manuel Arana Osorio]] was elected president. By 1972, members of the guerrilla movement entered the country from Mexico and settled in the Western Highlands. In the [[Guatemalan general election, 1974|disputed election of 1974]], General [[Kjell Eugenio Laugerud García|Kjell Laugerud García]] defeated General [[Efraín Ríos Montt]], a candidate of the Christian Democratic Party, who claimed that he had been cheated out of a victory through fraud.

On 4 February 1976, a major earthquake destroyed several cities and caused more than 25,000 deaths, especially among the poor, whose housing was substandard. The government's failure to respond rapidly to the aftermath of the earthquake and to relieve homelessness gave rise to widespread discontent, which contributed to growing popular unrest. General [[Romeo Lucas García]] assumed power in 1978 in a fraudulent election.

The 1970s saw the rise of two new guerrilla organizations, the Guerrilla Army of the Poor (EGP) and the Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA). They began guerrilla attacks that included urban and rural warfare, mainly against the military and some civilian supporters of the army. The army and the paramilitary forces responded with a brutal counter-insurgency campaign that resulted in tens of thousands of civilian deaths.{{sfn|LaFeber|1993|p=165}} In 1979, the U.S. president, [[Jimmy Carter]], who had until then been providing public support for the government forces, ordered a ban on all military aid to the Guatemalan Army because of its widespread and systematic abuse of human rights.<ref name="Chomsky 1985 154–160" /> However, documents have since come to light that suggest that American aid continued throughout the Carter years, through clandestine channels.<ref>{{cite book

On 31 January 1980, a group of indigenous [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] took over the Spanish Embassy to protest army massacres in the countryside. The Guatemalan government armed forces launched an assault that killed almost everyone inside in a [[Burning of the Spanish Embassy|fire that consumed the building]].

This government was overthrown in 1982 and General [[Efraín Ríos Montt]] was named President of the military junta. He continued the bloody campaign of torture, [[forced disappearance]]s, and "[[scorched earth]]" warfare.

In 1982, the four guerrilla groups, EGP, ORPA, FAR and PGT, merged and formed the [[Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity|URNG]], influenced by the [[El Salvador|Salvadoran]] guerrilla [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|FMLN]], the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|FSLN]] and [[Cuba]]'s government, in order to become stronger. As a result of the Army's "scorched earth" tactics in the countryside, more than 45,000 Guatemalans fled across the border to Mexico. The Mexican government placed the refugees in camps in [[Chiapas]] and [[Tabasco]].

The [[Guatemalan Civil War]] ended in 1996 with a peace accord between the guerrillas and the government, negotiated by the United Nations through intense brokerage by nations such as Norway and Spain. Both sides made major concessions. The guerrilla fighters disarmed and received land to work.

=== 2000–2010 ===

Since the peace accords Guatemala has had both economic growth and successive democratic elections, most recently in 2015. In the 2015 elections, [[Jimmy Morales]] of the [[National Convergence Front]] won the presidency. He assumed office on 14 January 2016.

In January 2012 Efrain Rios Montt, the former dictator of Guatemala, appeared in a Guatemalan court on genocide charges. During the hearing, the government presented evidence of over 100 incidents involving at least 1,771 deaths, 1,445 rapes, and the displacement of nearly 30,000 Guatemalans during his 17-month rule from 1982–1983. The prosecution wanted him incarcerated because he was viewed as a flight risk but he remained free on bail, under house arrest and guarded by the Guatemalan National Civil Police (PNC). On 10 May 2013, Rios Montt was found guilty and sentenced to 80 years in prison. It marked the first time that a national court had found a former head of state guilty of genocide.<ref>

Leaders of the political opposition have also been implicated in CICIG investigations: several legislators and members of Libertad Democrática Renovada party (LIDER) were formally accused of bribery-related issues, prompting a large decline in the electoral prospects of its presidential candidate, Manuel Baldizón, who until April had been almost certain to become the next Guatemalan president in the 6 September 2015 presidential elections.

CICIG reported its cases so often on Thursdays that Guatemalans coined the term "CICIG Thursdays". But a Friday press conference brought the crisis to its peak: on Friday 21 August 2015, the CICIG and Attorney General Thelma Aldana presented enough evidence to convince the public that both President Pérez Molina and former vice President Baldetti were the actual leaders of "La Línea". Baldetti was arrested the same day and an impeachment was requested for the president. Several cabinet members resigned and the clamor for the president's resignation grew after Perez Molina defiantly assured the nation in a televised message broadcast on 23 August 2015 that he was not going to resign.<ref name=periodico21a>{{cite news

Thousands of protesters took to the streets again, this time to demand the increasingly isolated president's resignation. Guatemala's Congress named a commission of five legislators to consider whether to remove the president's immunity from prosecution. The Supreme Court approved. A major day of action kicked off early on 27 August, with marches and roadblocks across the country. Urban groups who had spearheaded regular protests since the scandal broke in April, on the 27th sought to unite with the rural and indigenous organizations who orchestrated the road blocks.

The strike in Guatemala City was full of a diverse and peaceful crowd ranging from the indigenous poor to the well-heeled, and it included many students from public and private universities. Hundreds of schools and businesses closed in support of the protests. The ''Comité Coordinador de Asociaciones Agrícolas, Comerciales, Industriales y Financieras'' (CACIF) Guatemala's most powerful business leaders, issued a statement demanding that Pérez Molina step down, and urged Congress to withdraw his immunity from prosecution.<ref name=cacifMolina>

The Guatemalan radio station Emisoras Unidas reported exchanging text messages with Perez Molina. Asked whether he planned to resign, he wrote: "I will face whatever is necessary to face, and what the law requires." Some protesters demanded the general election be postponed, both because of the crisis and because it was plagued with accusations of irregularities. Others warned that suspending the vote could lead to an institutional vacuum.<ref>{{cite news

{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}<!--only Biodiversity section has any references-->
{{Main|Geography of Guatemala}}
[[File:Un-guatemala.png|thumb|A map of Guatemala.]]
[[File:Guatemala Köppen.svg|thumb|Köppen climate types of Guatemala]]
[[File:Quetzaltenango farm highlands 2009.jpg|thumb|The highlands of [[Quetzaltenango]].]]

Guatemala is mountainous with small patches of desert and sand dunes, all hilly valleys, except for the south coast and the vast northern lowlands of [[Petén (department)|Petén]] department. Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing Guatemala into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains and the Petén region, north of the mountains.

All major cities are located in the highlands and Pacific coast regions; by comparison, Petén is sparsely populated. These three regions vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot, humid tropical lowlands and colder, drier highland peaks. [[Volcán Tajumulco]], at {{convert|4,220|m|abbr=off}}, is the highest point in the Central American countries.

The rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific drainage basin, larger and deeper in the Caribbean and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainage basins. These rivers include the [[Polochic River|Polochic]] and [[Dulce River (Guatemala)|Dulce Rivers]], which drain into [[Lake Izabal]], the [[Motagua River]], the Sarstún, which forms the boundary with Belize, and the [[Usumacinta River]], which forms the boundary between Petén and [[Chiapas]], Mexico.

===Natural disasters===
{{For|the 2018 volcanic eruption|2018 Volcán de Fuego eruption}}
[[File:guatemala town volcanic crater.jpg|thumb|A town along the [[Pan-American Highway]] within a volcanic crater.]]
Guatemala's location between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 and [[Hurricane Stan]] in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people. The damage was not wind-related, but rather due to significant [[flooding]] and resulting [[mudflow|mudslides]]. The most recent was [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]] in late May 2010, which killed more than 200.

Guatemala's highlands lie along the [[Motagua Fault]], part of the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[tectonic plates]]. This fault has been responsible for several major earthquakes in historic times, including a 7.5 magnitude tremor on 4 February 1976 which killed more than 25,000 people. In addition, the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction zone]] lies off the Pacific coast. Here, the [[Cocos Plate]] is sinking beneath the Caribbean Plate, producing volcanic activity inland of the coast. Guatemala has 37 volcanoes, four of them active: [[Pacaya]], [[Santiaguito]], [[Volcán de Fuego|Fuego]], and [[Volcán Tacaná|Tacaná]].

Natural disasters have a long history in this geologically active part of the world. For example, two of the three [[Antigua Guatemala#History|moves]] of the capital of Guatemala have been due to volcanic mudflows in 1541 and earthquakes in 1773.

Guatemala is the largest economy in Central America, with a GDP (PPP) per capita of US$5,200. However, Guatemala faces many social problems and is one of the poorest countries in Latin America. The income distribution is highly unequal with more than half of the population below the national poverty line and just over 400,000 (3.2%) unemployed. The CIA World Fact Book considers 54.0% of the population of Guatemala to be living in poverty in 2009.<ref name="cia" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Guatemala: An Assessment of Poverty |url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20207581~menuPK:443285~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=9 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302150027/http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTPOVERTY/EXTPA/0,,contentMDK:20207581~menuPK:443285~pagePK:148956~piPK:216618~theSitePK:430367,00.html |archive-date=2 March 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2010, the [[Guatemalan economy]] grew by 3%, recovering gradually from the 2009 crisis, as a result of the falling demands from the United States and others [[Central American]] markets and the slowdown in foreign investment in the middle of the [[Global recession of 2009|global recession]].<ref>[http://www.deguate.com/infocentros/ecofin/guatemala/economia/indicadores-economicos/producto-interno-bruto.php El Producto Interno Bruto de Guatemala] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703215613/http://www.deguate.com/infocentros/ecofin/guatemala/economia/indicadores-economicos/producto-interno-bruto.php |date=3 July 2015 }} ''DeGuate''</ref>

[[Remittance]]s from Guatemalans living in United States now constitute the largest single source of foreign income (two thirds of exports and one tenth of GDP).<ref name="cia" />

Some of Guatemala's main exports are fruits, vegetables, flowers, handicrafts, cloths and others. In the face of a rising demand for [[biofuel]]s, the country is growing and exporting an increasing amount of raw materials for biofuel production, especially [[sugar cane]] and [[palm oil]]. Critics say that this development leads to higher prices for [[staple food]]s like corn, a major ingredient in the Guatemalan diet. As a consequence of the subsidization of US American corn, Guatemala imports nearly half of its corn from the United States that is using 40 percent of its crop harvest for biofuel production.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/science/earth/in-fields-and-markets-guatemalans-feels-squeeze-of-biofuel-demand.html As Biofuel Demands Grows, So Do Guatemala's Hunger Pangs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108075322/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/science/earth/in-fields-and-markets-guatemalans-feels-squeeze-of-biofuel-demand.html |date=8 January 2013 }}.

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) in 2010 was estimated at US$70.15 billion.

Organic coffee, sugar, textiles, fresh vegetables, and bananas are the country's main exports. Inflation was 3.9% in 2010.

The 1996 peace accords that ended the decades-long civil war removed a major obstacle to foreign investment. Tourism has become an increasing source of revenue for Guatemala thanks to the new foreign investment.

=== Tourism ===
{{main|Tourism in Guatemala}}
Tourism has become one of the main drivers of the economy, with tourism estimated at $1.8 billion to the economy in 2008. Guatemala received around two million tourists annually. In recent years, an increase in the number of cruise ships have been visiting Guatemalan seaports, leading to higher tourist numbers.

In its territory there are fascinating Mayan archaeological sites (Tikal in the Peten, Quiriguá in Izabal, Iximche in Tecpan Chimaltenango and Guatemala City). Natural attractions include locations such as Lake Atitlan and Semuc Champey. Historical tourism includes the colonial city of [[Antigua Guatemala]], which is recognized as a UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.

There is a strong interest within the international community for archaeological sites like the city of Tikal. To note, Tikal was built and inhabited in a period where the culture had its greatest literary and artistic expression, and was ruled by a dynasty of 16 kings. The Maya of Tikal built many temples, a ball park, altars and stelae in high and low relief.

Guatemala is visited for its archaeological sites, pre-Hispanic cities as well as tourist-religious centers like the Basilica of Esquipulas in the city of Esquipulas, and the beaches on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Guatemala. Other tourist destinations are the national parks and other protected areas such as the Maya Biosphere Reserve.

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:Idiomasmap Guatemala.svg|thumb|Language map of Guatemala. The "Castilian" areas represent Spanish.]]
Guatemala is populated by a variety of ethnic, cultural, racial, and linguistic groups. According to the 2010 Census conducted by the [[National Institute of Statistics (Guatemala)|National Institute of Statistics (INE)]], about 41.5% of the population is [[Mestizo]] (also known as ''[[Ladino people|Ladino]]''), reflecting mixed indigenous and European heritage. A similar proportion of Guatemalans (41%) are of full Amerindian ancestry, which is among one of the largest percentage in Latin America, behind only Peru and Bolivia. Most indigenous Guatemalans are of the [[Maya people]], namely [[K'iche' people|K'iche']] (11.0% of the total population), [[Q'eqchi' people|Q'eqchi]] (8.3%), [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]] (7.8%), [[Mam people|Mam]] (5.2%), and "other [[Maya peoples|Maya]]" (7.6%). Less than 1% are indigenous non-Maya.<ref>National population of the [http://www.ine.gob.gt/index.php/demografia-y-poblacion/42-demografiaypoblacion/207-infodemo2010 National Institute of Statistics (INE)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316080509/http://www.ine.gob.gt/index.php/demografia-y-poblacion/42-demografiaypoblacion/207-infodemo2010 |date=16 March 2010 }}. demographic info 2010.</ref>

[[White people|White]] Guatemalans of European descent, also called [[Criollo people|Criollo]], make up 18.5% of the population. Most are descendants of German and Spanish settlers, and others derive from Italians, British, French, Swiss, Belgians, Dutch, Russians and Danish. German settlers are credited with bringing the tradition of Christmas trees to Guatemala.<ref>[http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/trees/traditions-world.html History of the Christmas Tree] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905053744/http://www.urbanext.uiuc.edu/trees/traditions-world.html |date=5 September 2006 }}</ref>

The population includes about 110,000 Salvadorans. The [[Garífuna]], descended primarily from Black Africans who lived and intermarried with indigenous peoples from St. Vincent, live mainly in Livingston and [[Puerto Barrios]]. [[Afro-Guatemalan]]s and [[mulatto]]s descended primarily from banana plantation workers. There are also [[Asian people|Asians]], mostly of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] descent but also [[Arab people|Arabs]] of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Syrian people|Syrian]] descent. A growing [[Koreans|Korean]] community in Guatemala City and in nearby [[Mixco]], numbers about 50,000.<ref>Rodríguez, Luisa (29 August 2004)

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Guatemala}}

Guatemala's sole official language is Spanish, spoken by 93 percent of the population as either the first or second language.

Twenty-one [[Mayan languages]] are spoken, especially in rural areas, as well as two non-Mayan [[Amerindian]] languages: [[Xinca language|Xinca]], which is indigenous to the country, and [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]], an [[Arawakan]] language spoken on the Caribbean coast. According to the Language Law of 2003, these languages are unrecognized as National Languages.<ref name="Decreto19-2003">{{cite web |accessdate=10 June 2007 |url=http://www.oj.gob.gt/es/QueEsOJ/EstructuraOJ/UnidadesAdministrativas/CentroAnalisisDocumentacionJudicial/cds/CDs%20leyes/2003/Leyes%20en%20PDF/Decretos%202003/Decreto%2019-2003.pdf |title=Ley de Idiomas Nacionales, Decreto Número 19-2003 |format=PDF |language=Spanish |publisher=El Congreso de la República de Guatemala |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235237/http://www.oj.gob.gt/es/QueEsOJ/EstructuraOJ/UnidadesAdministrativas/CentroAnalisisDocumentacionJudicial/cds/CDs%20leyes/2003/Leyes%20en%20PDF/Decretos%202003/Decreto%2019-2003.pdf |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

There are also significant numbers of [[German language|German]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], French and [[English language]] speakers.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Indigenous integration and bilingual education ===

Throughout the 20th century there have been many developments in the integration of [[Mayan languages]] into the Guatemalan society and educational system. Originating from political reasons, these processes have aided the revival of some Mayan languages and advanced bilingual education in the country.

In 1945, in order to overcome "the Indian problem", the Guatemalan government founded The Institute Indigents ta National (NH), the purpose of which was to teach literacy to Mayan children in their mother tongue instead of Spanish, to prepare the ground for later assimilation of the latter. The teaching of literacy in the first language, which received support from the UN, significantly advanced in 1952, when the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics), located in Dallas, Texas, partnered with the Guatemalan Ministry of Education; within 2 years, numerous written works in Mayan languages had been printed and published, and vast advancement was done in the translation of the New Testament. Further efforts to integrate the indigenous into the Ladino<ref>Heimberger, Janet L. Language and Ethnicity: Multiple Literacies in Context, Language Education in Guatemala. ''Bilingual Research Journal''. Vol. 30, Issue 1, pp. 65–86, 2006.</ref> society were made in the following years, including the invention of a special alphabet to assist Mayan students transition to Spanish, and bilingual education in the Q'eqchi' area. When Spanish became the official language of Guatemala in 1965, the government started several programs, such as the Bilingual [[Castellanización|Castellanizacion]] Program and the Radiophonic Schools, to accelerate the move of Mayan students to Spanish. Unintentionally, the efforts to integrate the indigenous using language, especially the new alphabet, gave institutions tools to use Mayan tongues in schools, and while improving Mayan children's learning, they left them unequipped to learn in a solely Spanish environment. So, an additional expansion of bilingual education took place in 1980, when an experimental program in which children were to be instructed in their mother tongue until they are fluent enough in Spanish was created. The program proved successful when the students of the pilot showed higher academic achievements than the ones in the Spanish-only control schools. In 1987, when the pilot was to finish, bilingual education was made official in Guatemala.

[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, Guatemala City.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Guatemala City|Catedral Metropolitana]], Guatemala City.]]

[[Christianity]] continues to remain strong and vital for the life of [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemalan society]], but its composition has changed over generations of social and political unrest. [[Roman Catholicism]], introduced by the Spanish during the colonial era, remains the largest denomination or church, accounting for 48.4% of the population {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. [[Protestants]], most of them [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (most Protestants are called ''Evangelicos'' in Latin America) in a wide number of different denominations, made up 33.7% of the population at that time, followed by 1.6% in other religions (such as [[Jews in Guatemala|Judaism]], [[Islam in Guatemala|Islam]], and [[Buddhism]]), and 16.1% claiming no religious affiliation. A more recent 2012 survey reveals Catholics at 47.6%, Protestants at 38.2%, other religions at 2.6%, and the non-religious at 11.6%.

Since the 1970s, and particularly since the 1990s, Guatemala has experienced the rapid growth of Evangelical Protestantism, whose adherents currently form more than 38% of the population, and still growing, in different denominations.

Over the past two decades, particularly since the end of the civil war, Guatemala has seen heightened missionary activity. Protestant denominations have grown markedly in recent decades, chiefly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] varieties; growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Maya population, with the [[National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala]] maintaining 11 indigenous-language presbyteries. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has grown from 40,000 members in 1984 to 164,000 in 1998, and continues to expand.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/church/temples/quetzaltenango-guatemala |title=Quetzaltenango Guatemala |publisher=Lds.org |accessdate=3 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203152656/https://www.lds.org/church/temples/quetzaltenango-guatemala |archive-date=3 February 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/quetzaltenango/ |title=Quetzaltenango Guatemala LDS (Mormon) Temple |publisher=Ldschurchtemples.com |accessdate=3 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601200123/http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/quetzaltenango/ |archivedate=1 June 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Immigration ===
{{main|Immigration to Guatemala}}
During the colonial era Guatemala received immigrants (settlers) only from Spain. Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom [[fincas]] in [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Zacapa]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Baja Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.

Many European immigrants to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, and entrepreneurs as well as families looking to settle. Up to 1950 Guatemala was the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind [[Costa Rica]], and large numbers of immigrants are still received today.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}
Since the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from [[Korea]], China, Japan, [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also, beginning with the [[First World War]], the immigrant population is being strengthened by [[Jewish]] immigration.

During the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew in Guatemala, particularly from other [[Central American]] countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Argentina, although most of these immigrants stayed only temporarily before going to their final destinations in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Education ===
74.5% of the population aged 15 and over is literate, the lowest [[literacy]] rate in Central America. Guatemala has a plan to increase literacy over the next 20 years.<ref>[http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=121&IF_Language=eng&BR_Country=3200&BR_Region=40520 Education (all levels) profile&nbsp;– Guatemala] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112213255/http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/document.aspx?ReportId=121&IF_Language=eng&BR_Country=3200&BR_Region=40520 |date=12 January 2012 }}. UNESCO Institute for Statistics. Retrieved on 2 January 2012.</ref>

The government runs a number of public elementary and secondary-level schools, as [[youth in Guatemala]] do not fully participate in education. These schools are free, though the cost of uniforms, books, supplies, and transportation makes them less accessible to the poorer segments of society and significant numbers of poor children do not attend school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/poverty-corruption-and-racism-guatemalas-primary-schools-reflect-countrys-social-problems|title=Development + Cooperation: Guatemala's Social Problems - "Free - but still too expensive"|publisher=Development + Cooperation: D+C|accessdate=January 6, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190106210451/https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/poverty-corruption-and-racism-guatemalas-primary-schools-reflect-countrys-social-problems|archive-date=6 January 2019|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Many middle and upper-class children go to private schools. Guatemala has one public university (USAC or [[Universidad de San Carlos de Guatemala]]), and fourteen private ones (see [[List of universities in Guatemala]]). USAC was the first university in Guatemala and one of the first Universities of America.

Organizations such as [[Child Aid]], [[Pueblo a Pueblo]], and [[Common Hope]], which train teachers in villages throughout the Central Highlands region, are working to improve educational outcomes for children. Lack of training for rural teachers is one of the key contributors to Guatemala's low literacy rates.

Guatemala City is home to many of the nation's libraries and museums, including the National Archives, the National Library, and the Museum of Archeology and Ethnology, which has an extensive collection of Maya artifacts. It also boasts private museums such as the [[Ixchel Museum of Indigenous Textiles and Clothing]] and the [[Museo Popol Vuh]], which focuses on Maya archaeology. Both these museums are housed on the [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]] campus. Most of the 329 municipalities in the country have at least a small museum.

=== Art ===
Guatemala has produced many indigenous artists who follow centuries-old Pre-Columbian traditions. Reflecting Guatemala's colonial and post-colonial history, encounters with multiple global art movements also have produced a wealth of artists who have combined the traditional [[Primitivism|primitivist]] or [[Naïve art|naive aesthetic]] with European, North American, and other traditions.

The [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"]] is Guatemala's leading art school, and several leading indigenous artists, also graduates of that school, have work in the permanent collection of the [[Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno "Carlos Mérida"|Museo Nacional de Arte Moderno]] in the capital city. Contemporary Guatemalan artists who have gained reputations outside of Guatemala include Dagoberto Vásquez, [[Luis Rolando Ixquiac Xicara]], [[Carlos Mérida]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latinartmuseum.com/merida.htm |title=retrieved September 28, 2009 |publisher=Latinartmuseum.com |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=1 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526201936/http://www.latinartmuseum.com/merida.htm |archive-date=26 May 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Aníbal López]], [[Roberto González Goyri]], and [[Elmar Rojas|Elmar René Rojas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.latinartmuseum.com/elmar_rojas.htm |title=Elmar Rojas y la utopia pictorica latinoamercana |publisher=Latinartmuseum.com |accessdate=1 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531042052/http://www.latinartmuseum.com/elmar_rojas.htm |archive-date=31 May 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Many contemporary music groups in Guatemala play [[Caribbean music]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Garifuna music|Garifuna]]-influenced [[punta]], [[Latin pop]], [[Music of Mexico|Mexican regional]], and [[mariachi]].

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Guatemalan cuisine}}
[[File:091225 tamales.JPG|thumb|Black and red [[tamale]]s in Guatemala]]
Many traditional foods in Guatemalan cuisine are based on Mayan cuisine and prominently feature [[maize]], [[Chili pepper|chilies]] and [[Black turtle bean|black beans]] as key ingredients. Traditional dishes also include a variety of stews including Kak'ik ''(Kak-ik)'', which is a tomato-based stew with [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]], pepian, and [[cocido]]. Guatemala is also known for its ''[[Mexican street food|antojitos]]'', which include small [[tamale]]s called ''chuchitos'', fried [[Cooking banana|plantains]], and [[Tostada (tortilla)|tostadas]] with [[tomato sauce]], [[guacamole]] or black beans. Certain foods are also commonly eaten on certain days of the week; for example, a popular custom is to eat ''paches'' (a kind of tamale made from potatoes) on Thursday. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as [[fiambre]] for [[All Saints' Day]] on 1 November, or tamales and ''ponche'' ([[Punch (drink)|fruit punch]]), which are both very common around Christmas.

=== Sports ===
==== Football ====
{{Main|Football in Guatemala}}
[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Guatemala and its [[Guatemala national football team|national team]] has appeared in 18 editions of the [[CONCACAF Championship]], winning it once, in [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]]. However, the team has failed to qualify to a [[FIFA World Cup]] so far. Established in 1919, the [[National Football Federation of Guatemala]] organizes the country's [[Liga Nacional de Fútbol de Guatemala|national league]] and its lower-level competitions.

==== Futsal ====

[[Futsal]] is probably the most successful [[team sport]] in Guatemala. Its [[Guatemala national futsal team|national team]] won the [[2008 CONCACAF Futsal Championship]] as hosts. It was also the runner-up in [[2012 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2012]] as hosts and won the bronze medal in [[2016 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2016]].

Guatemala participated for the first time in the [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] in [[2000 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2000]], as hosts, and has played in every competition from [[2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2008]] onwards. It has never passed the first round. It has also participated in every [[Grand Prix de Futsal]] since [[2009 Grand Prix de Futsal|2009]], reaching the semifinals in [[2014 Grand Prix de Futsal|2014]].

==== Olympics ====
{{Further|Guatemala at the Olympics}}
The [[Guatemalan Olympic Committee]] was founded in 1947 and recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] that same year. Guatemala participated in the [[Guatemala at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]], and in every edition since the [[Guatemala at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Summer Olympics]]. It has also appeared in a single [[Winter Olympics]] edition, in [[Guatemala at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]].

[[Erick Barrondo]] won the only Olympic medal for Guatemala so far, silver in [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's 20 kilometres walk|race walking]] at the [[Guatemala at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]].

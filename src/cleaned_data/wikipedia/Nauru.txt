Its nearest neighbour is [[Banaba Island]] in [[Kiribati]], {{convert|300|km}} to the east. It further lies northwest of [[Tuvalu]], north of the [[Solomon Islands]], east-northeast of [[Papua New Guinea]], southeast of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and south of the [[Marshall Islands]]. With only a {{convert|21|km2|adj=on}} area, Nauru is the third-smallest state on the [[list of countries and dependencies by area]] behind [[Vatican City]] and [[Monaco]], making it the smallest state in the [[South Pacific Ocean]], the smallest island state, and the smallest [[republic]].  Its population is {{UN Population|Nauru}}, making it the third smallest on the [[list of countries and dependencies by population]], after the Vatican and [[Tuvalu]].

Settled by people from [[Micronesia]] and [[Polynesia]] {{circa| 1000 BC}}, Nauru was [[annexation|annexed]] and claimed as a colony by the [[German Empire]] in the late 19th century. After [[World War&nbsp;I]], Nauru became a [[League of Nations mandate]] administered by Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. During [[World War&nbsp;II]], Nauru was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops, who were bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. After the war ended, the country entered into [[United Nations trusteeship]]. Nauru gained its independence in 1968, and became a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC) in 1969.

Nauru is a [[Phosphorite|phosphate-rock]] island with rich deposits near the surface, which allowed easy [[Surface mining|strip mining]] operations. It has some remaining phosphate resources which, {{as of|2011|lc=y}}, are not economically viable for extraction.<ref>{{cite web |author=Hogan, C Michael |year=2011 |url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Phosphate?topic=49557 |title=Phosphate |work=Encyclopedia of Earth |publisher=National Council for Science and the Environment |accessdate=17 June 2012 }}</ref> When the phosphate reserves were exhausted, and the island's environment had been seriously harmed by mining, the trust that had been established to manage the island's wealth diminished in value.

Nauru was one of three great [[Phosphorite|phosphate rock]] islands in the Pacific Ocean, along with [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] (Ocean Island), in [[Kiribati]], and [[Makatea]], in [[French Polynesia]]. The phosphate reserves on Nauru are now almost entirely depleted. Phosphate mining in the central plateau has left a barren terrain of jagged limestone pinnacles up to {{convert|15|m}} high. Mining has stripped and devastated about 80 per cent of Nauru's land area, leaving it uninhabitable,<ref name="KN-20180916" /> and has also affected the surrounding [[exclusive economic zone]]; 40 per cent of marine life is estimated to have been killed by silt and phosphate runoff.<ref name="state"/><ref name="UNCCC">{{cite web |author=Republic of Nauru |year=1999 |url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/naunc1.pdf |title=Climate Change&nbsp;– Response |work=First National Communication |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=9 September 2009 }}</ref>

There are limited natural sources of fresh water on Nauru. Rooftop [[Rainwater tank|storage tanks]] collect rainwater. The islanders are mostly dependent on three [[desalination]] plants housed at Nauru's Utilities Agency.

=== Climate ===
Nauru's climate is hot and very humid year-round because of its proximity to the equator and the ocean. Nauru is hit by [[monsoon]] rains between November and February, but usually no cyclones. Annual rainfall is highly variable and is influenced by the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation]], with several significant recorded droughts.<ref name="UNCCD"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Affaire de certaines terres à phosphates à Nauru |year=2003 |publisher=International Court of Justice |isbn=978-92-1-070936-1 |pages=107–109 }}</ref> The temperature on Nauru ranges between {{convert|30|and|35|C}} during the day and is remarkably stable at around {{convert|25|C}} at night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/PCCSP/pdf/6._Nauru_GH_poster.pdf |title=Pacific Climate Change Science Program |accessdate=10 June 2012 |publisher=Government of Australia |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227175200/http://www.cawcr.gov.au/projects/PCCSP/pdf/6._Nauru_GH_poster.pdf |archivedate=27 February 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:Baron Waqa.jpg|thumb|upright|Baron Waqa, the incumbent [[President of Nauru]]]]
[[File:Nauru-parliament.jpg|thumb|Parliament of Nauru]]

The president of Nauru is [[Baron Waqa]], who heads a 19-member [[unicameralism|unicameral]] parliament. The country is a member of the United Nations, the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]]. Nauru also participates in the [[Commonwealth Games|Commonwealth]] and [[Olympic Games]]. Recently Nauru became a member country of the [[International Renewable Energy Agency]] (IRENA). The Republic of Nauru became the 189th member of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in April 2016.

Nauru is a republic with a [[parliamentary system]] of government.<ref name=davidson/> The president is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. A 19-member unicameral parliament is elected every three years.<ref>

Nauru does not have any formal structure for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19&nbsp;members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that have been active in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the [[Democratic Party of Nauru|Democratic Party]], [[Nauru First]] and the [[Centre Party (Nauru)|Centre Party]]. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Anckar |first1=D |last2=Anckar |first2=C |title=Democracies without Parties |journal=Comparative Political Studies |year=2000 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=225–247 |doi=10.1177/0010414000033002003 }}</ref>

From 1992 to 1999, Nauru had a local government system known as the Nauru Island Council (NIC). This nine-member council was designed to provide municipal services. The NIC was dissolved in 1999 and all assets and liabilities became vested in the national government.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hassell, Graham |author2=Tipu, Feue |date=May 2008 |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/ComJlLocGov/2008/3.html |title=Local Government in the South Pacific Islands |journal=Commonwealth Journal of Local Governance |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=6–30 }}</ref> [[Land tenure]] on Nauru is unusual: all Nauruans have certain rights to all land on the island, which is owned by individuals and family groups.

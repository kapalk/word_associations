In 64 BC, the region came under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]], and eventually became one of the Empire's leading centers of [[Christianity]]. In the [[Mount Lebanon]] range a monastic tradition known as the [[Maronite Church]] was established. As the [[Arab]] [[Muslim]]s conquered the region, the [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronites]] held onto their religion and [[Religious identity|identity]]. However, a new religious group, the [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]], established themselves in Mount Lebanon as well, generating a religious divide that has lasted for centuries. During the [[Crusades]], the Maronites re-established contact with the [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic Church]] and asserted their communion with Rome. The ties they established with the Latins have influenced the region into the modern era.

The region eventually was ruled by the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1516 to 1918. Following the collapse of the empire after [[World War I]], the five provinces that constitute modern Lebanon came under the [[French Mandate of Lebanon]]. The [[France|French]] expanded the borders of the [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]], which was mostly populated by Maronites and Druze, to include more Muslims. Lebanon gained independence in 1943, establishing [[Confessionalism (politics)|confessionalism]], a unique, [[Consociationalism]]-type of political system with a power-sharing mechanism based on religious communities. [[Bechara El Khoury]], President of Lebanon during the independence, [[Riad El-Solh]], first [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|Lebanese prime minister]] and [[Emir Majid Arslan II]], first [[List of Prime Ministers of Lebanon|Lebanese minister of defence]], are considered the founders of the modern Republic of Lebanon and are national heroes for having led the country's independence.

== Etymology ==
<!--linked-->
The name of [[Mount Lebanon]] originates from the [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] root ''{{lang|sem|lbn}}'' ([[wikt:𐤋𐤁𐤍|𐤋𐤁𐤍]]) meaning "white", apparently from its snow-capped peaks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Placenames of the World: Origins and Meanings of the Names for 6,621 Countries, Cities, Territories, Natural Features and Historic Sites |last1=Room |first1=Adrian |edition=2nd |year=2005|publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7 |pages=214–216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA214}}</ref>

Occurrences of the name have been found in different [[Middle Bronze Age]] texts from the library of [[Ebla]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford guide to people and places of the Bible |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |last2=Coogan |first2=Michael D. |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-517610-3 |page=178}}</ref> and three of the twelve tablets of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]].
The name is recorded in [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] as ''Rmnn'' (𓂋𓏠𓈖𓈖𓈉), where ''R'' stood for [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] ''L''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pronunciation of Ancient Egyptian| last=Ross| first=Kelley L| work=The Proceedings of the Friesian School, Fourth Series|url=http://www.friesian.com/egypt.htm| publisher=Friesian School| accessdate=20 January 2009}}</ref>

''Lebanon'' as the name of an administrative unit (as opposed to the mountain range) was introduced with the [[Tanzimat|Ottoman reforms]] of 1861, as the ''[[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]]'' ({{lang-ar|متصرفية جبل لبنان }}; {{lang-tr|Cebel-i Lübnan Mutasarrıflığı}}), continued in the name of the ''[[Greater Lebanon|State of Greater Lebanon]]'' ({{lang-ar|دولة لبنان الكبير}} ''{{transl|ar|Dawlat Lubnān al-Kabīr}}''; {{lang-fr|État du Grand Liban}}) in 1920, and eventually in the name of the sovereign ''Republic of Lebanon''  ({{lang-ar|الجمهورية اللبنانية}} {{transl|ar|''al-Jumhūrīyah al-Lubnānīyah''}}) upon its independence in 1943.

==History==
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}<!--quite a few paragraphs that have no citations-->
{{Main|History of Lebanon}}
The borders of contemporary Lebanon are a product of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of 1920.
Its territory was the core of the Bronze Age [[Phoenicia]]n ([[Canaan]]ite) city-states. As part of the [[Levant]], it was part of numerous succeeding empires throughout ancient history, including the  [[Egyptian Empire|Egyptian]], [[Phoenicia under Assyrian rule|Assyrian]], [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Babylonian]], [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Achaemenid Persian]], [[Phoenicia under Hellenistic rule|Hellenistic]], [[Phoenicia under Roman rule|Roman]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanid Persian]] empires.

After the 7th-century [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]], it was part of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]], [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umyayad]], [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] and [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] empires.
The [[crusader state]] of the [[County of Tripoli]], founded by [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] in 1102, encompassed most of present-day Lebanon, falling to the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] in 1289 and finally to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517. With the [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]], [[Greater Lebanon]] fell under [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]] in 1920, and gained independence under president [[Bechara El Khoury]] in 1943.
Lebanon's history since independence has been marked by alternating periods of political stability and prosperity based on [[Beirut]]'s position as a regional center for finance and trade, interspersed with political turmoil and armed conflict  ([[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], [[Lebanese Civil War]] 1975–1990, 2005 [[Cedar Revolution]], [[2006 Lebanon War]], [[2007 Lebanon conflict]], [[2006–08 Lebanese protests]], [[2008 conflict in Lebanon]], and since 2011 [[Syrian Civil War spillover in Lebanon|Syrian Civil War spillover]]).

Evidence dating back to an early settlement in Lebanon was found in [[Byblos]], considered one of the [[oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world.<ref name="byblos" /> The evidence dates back to earlier than 5000 BC. Archaeologists discovered remnants of prehistoric huts with crushed limestone floors, primitive weapons, and burial jars left by the [[Neolithic]] and [[Copper Age|Chalcolithic]] fishing communities who lived on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea over 7,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://destinationlebanon.gov.lb/eng/Byblos/History.asp |title=Archaeological Virtual Tours: Byblos |publisher=Destinationlebanon.gov.lb |accessdate=14 October 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080223164318/http://destinationlebanon.gov.lb/eng/Byblos/History.asp |archivedate = 23 February 2008}}</ref>

Lebanon was a part of northern [[Canaan]], and consequently became the homeland of Canaanite descendants – the [[Phoenicia]]ns, a seafaring people who spread across the Mediterranean before the rise of [[Cyrus the Great]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_lebanonphoenicians.htm |title=Lebanon in Ancient Times |publisher=About.com |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref> Their most famous colonies were [[Carthage]] in what is present-day [[Tunisia]] and [[Cádiz]] in present-day  [[Spain]]. The [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite-Phoenicians]] are also known as the inventors of the [[alphabet]], among many other things. The area of present-day Lebanon and the wider [[Eastern Mediterranean]] were subjugated by Cyrus in 539 BCE.<ref name="books.google.nl">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L7fr8WGPS_gC&pg=PA8|title=Global Security Watch—Lebanon: A Reference Handbook: A Reference Handbook|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref> The Persians forced some of its population to migrate to [[Carthage]], which remained a powerful nation until the [[Second Punic War]]. After two centuries of Persian rule, [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] ruler [[Alexander the Great]] attacked and burned [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|Tyre]], the most prominent Phoenician city. He conquered what is now Lebanon and other nearby regions of the Eastern Mediterranean in 332 BCE.<ref name="books.google.nl"/>

The region that is now Lebanon, as with the rest of Syria and much of [[Anatolia]], became a major center of Christianity in the [[Roman Empire]] during the early spread of the religion. During the late 4th and early 5th century, a hermit named [[Maron]] established a monastic tradition focused on the importance of [[monotheism]] and [[asceticism]], near the Mediterranean mountain range known as [[Mount Lebanon]]. The monks who followed Maron spread his teachings among Lebanese in the region. These Christians came to be known as [[Maronite]]s and moved into the mountains to avoid religious persecution by Roman authorities.<ref>{{cite book | title=From the Holy Mountain: A Journey Among the Christians of the Middle East | author=Dalrymple, William | year=1997 | publisher=Vintage Books (Random House) | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jHGYvr7rkrsC |page=305 | isbn=9780307948922}}</ref> During the frequent [[Roman-Persian Wars]] that lasted for many centuries, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persians]] occupied what is now Lebanon from 619 till 629.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFTHBoRvQbsC&pg=PA338|title=Colonialism|accessdate=25 December 2014}}</ref>

During the 7th century the Muslim Arabs [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Syria]] establishing a new regime to replace the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. Though Islam and the Arabic language were officially dominant under this new regime, the general populace nonetheless only gradually converted from Christianity and the Syriac language. The Maronite community in particular managed to maintain a large degree of autonomy despite the succession of rulers over Lebanon and Syria.

During the 11th century the [[Druze in Lebanon|Druze]] faith emerged from a branch of [[Shia Islam]]. The new faith gained followers in the southern portion of Mount Lebanon. The northern portion of Mount Lebanon was ruled by Druze feudal families to the early 14th century which was then brought to an end by the Mamluk invasion. The Maronite population increased gradually in Northern Mount Lebanon and the Druze have remained in Southern Mount Lebanon until the modern era. In the south of Lebanon, ([[Jabal Amel]]), [[Baalbek]] and the [[Beqaa Valley]] was ruled by Shia feudal families under the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire. Major cities on the coast, [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Beirut]], and others, were directly administered by the Muslim Caliphs and the people became more fully absorbed by the Arab culture.

Following the fall of Roman [[Anatolia]] to the Muslim Turks, the Byzantines put out a call to the Pope in Rome for assistance in the 11th century. The result was a series of wars known as the [[Crusades]] launched by the [[Frankish Empire|Franks]] in Western Europe to reclaim the former Byzantine Christian territories in the Eastern Mediterranean, especially [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (the ''[[Levant]]''). The [[First Crusade]] succeeded in temporarily establishing the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[County of Tripoli]] as Roman Catholic Christian states along the coast.<ref>{{cite book | author=Hillenbrand, Carole | publisher=Psychology Press | year=2000 | title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives | isbn=978-1-57958-354-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UalnoF5MBHMC |pages=20–21}}</ref> These crusader states made a lasting impact on the region, though their control was limited, and the region returned to full Muslim control after two centuries following the conquest by the Mamluks.

One of the most lasting effects of the Crusades in this region was the contact between the Franks (i.e. the French) and the Maronites. Unlike most other Christian communities in the [[Eastern Mediterranean]], who swore allegiance to [[Constantinople]] or other local patriarchs, the Maronites proclaimed allegiance to the Pope in Rome. As such the Franks saw them as Roman Catholic brethren. These initial contacts led to centuries of support for the Maronites from France and Italy, even after the fall of the Crusader states in the region.

In the Middle East, Lebanon seems to offer a corresponding example. When the idea of a Greater Lebanon in 1908 was put forward in a book by Bulus Nujaym, a Lebanese Maronite writing under the pseudonym of M. Jouplain, he suggested that the natural boundaries of Lebanon were exactly the same as drawn in the 1861 and 1863 staff maps of the French military expedition to Syria, maps that added territories on the northern, eastern and southern borders, plus the city of Beirut, to the Mutasarrifiyya of Mount Lebanon. In this case, too, the prior existence of a European military map seems to have created a fact on the ground.}}</ref>]]

During this period Lebanon was divided into several provinces: Northern and Southern Mount Lebanon, Tripoli, Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and [[Jabal Amel]].
In southern Mount Lebanon in 1590, [[Fakhr-al-Din II]] became the successor to [[Mount Lebanon Emirate#Qurqumaz (1544–1585)|Korkmaz]]. He soon established his authority as paramount prince of the Druze in the Shouf area of Mount Lebanon. Eventually, Fakhr-al-Din II was appointed [[Sanjak-bey|Sanjakbey]] (Governor) of several Ottoman sub-provinces, with responsibility for tax-gathering. He extended his control over a substantial part of Mount Lebanon and its coastal area, even building a fort as far inland as [[Palmyra Castle|Palmyra]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Gorton, T.J. |title=Renaissance Emir |publisher=Quartet Books |date=25 April 2013 |isbn=9780704372979 |pages=160–161}}</ref> This over-reaching eventually became too much for Ottoman Sultan [[Murad IV]], who sent a punitive expedition to capture him in 1633. He was taken to [[Istanbul]], kept in prison for two years and then executed along with one of his sons in April 1635.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gorton, T.J. |title=Renaissance Emir |publisher=Quartet Books |date=25 April 2013 |isbn=9780704372979 |pages=195–210}}</ref> Surviving members of Fakhr al-Din's family ruled a reduced area under closer Ottoman control until the end of the 17th century.

On the death of the last Maan emir, various members of the Shihab clan ruled Mount Lebanon until 1830. Approximately 10,000 Christians [[1860 Lebanon conflict|were killed]] by the Druzes during inter-communal violence in 1860.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+lb0026) |title=Lebanon |work=Library of Congress Country Studies |date=December 1987}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, the [[Emirate of Mount Lebanon]], which lasted about 400 years, was replaced by the [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]], as a result of a European-Ottoman treaty called the [[Règlement Organique (Lebanon)|Règlement Organique]].
The Baalbek and Beqaa Valley and Jabal Amel was ruled intermittently by various Shia feudal families, especially the Al Ali Alsagheer in Jabal Amel that remained in power until 1865  when Ottomans took direct ruling of the region. [[Youssef Bey Karam]], a Lebanese nationalist played an influential role in Lebanon's independence during this era.

In 1920, following WWI, the area of the Mutasarrifate, plus some surrounding areas which were predominantly [[Shia Islam in Lebanon|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni]], became a part of the state of [[Greater Lebanon]] under the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon]]. Around 100,000 people in Beirut and Mount Lebanon died of starvation during World War I.<ref>{{cite web |author= Saadi, Abdul-Ilah|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/arabunity/2008/02/2008525183842614205.html |title=Dreaming of Greater Syria |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=12 February 2008}}</ref> In the first half of 1920, Lebanese territory was claimed as part of the [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]], but shortly the [[Franco-Syrian War]] resulted in Arab defeat and capitulation of the Hashemites.

A constitution was adopted on 25 May 1926 establishing a democratic republic with a parliamentary system of government.

===Independence from France===

Lebanon gained a measure of independence while France was occupied by Germany.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.pbs.org/behindcloseddoors/glossary.html| title = Glossary: Cross-Channel invasion| accessdate =17 October 2009| publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}</ref> General [[Henri Dentz]], the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] [[High Commissioner]] for Syria and Lebanon, played a major role in the independence of the nation. The Vichy authorities in 1941 allowed Germany to move aircraft and supplies through [[Syria]] to [[Iraq]] where they were used against British forces. The United Kingdom, fearing that [[Nazi Germany]] would gain full control of Lebanon and [[Syria]] by pressure on the weak Vichy government, sent its army into Syria and Lebanon.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

After the fighting ended in Lebanon, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] visited the area. Under political pressure from both inside and outside Lebanon, de Gaulle recognized the independence of Lebanon. On 26 November 1941 General [[Georges Catroux]] announced that Lebanon would become independent under the authority of the [[Free French]] government. Elections were held in 1943 and on 8 November 1943 the new Lebanese government unilaterally abolished the mandate. The French reacted by imprisoning the new government. In the face of international pressure, the French released the government officials on 22 November 1943. The [[Allies of World War II|allies]] occupied the region until the end of World War II.

Following the end of World War II in Europe the French mandate may be said to have been terminated without any formal action on the part of the [[League of Nations]] or its successor the [[United Nations]]. The mandate was ended by the declaration of the mandatory power, and of the new states themselves, of their independence, followed by a process of piecemeal unconditional recognition by other powers, culminating in formal admission to the United Nations. Article 78 of the UN Charter ended the status of tutelage for any member state: "The trusteeship system shall not apply to territories which have become Members of the United Nations, relationship among which shall be based on respect for the principle of sovereign equality."<ref>Mandates, Dependencies and Trusteeship, by H. Duncan Hall, Carnegie Endowment, 1948, pages 265–266</ref> So when the UN officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, after ratification of the [[United Nations Charter]] by the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], as both Syria and Lebanon were founding member states, the French mandate for both was legally terminated on that date and full independence attained.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/aboutun/unhistory/ |title=History of the United Nations |publisher=United Nations |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127033154/http://www.un.org/aboutun/unhistory/ |archivedate=27 January 2012 |df= }}</ref> The last French troops withdrew in December 1946.

In May 1948, Lebanon supported neighbouring Arab countries in a [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|war against Israel]]. While some irregular forces crossed the border and carried out minor skirmishes against Israel, it was without the support of the Lebanese government, and Lebanese troops did not officially invade.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=524}} Lebanon agreed to support the forces with covering artillery fire, armored cars, volunteers and logistical support.{{sfn|Morris|2008|p=259}} On 5–6 June 1948, the Lebanese army – led by the then [[Minister of Defense|Minister of National Defence]], [[Emir Majid Arslan II|Emir Majid Arslan]] – captured [[Al-Malkiyya]].

In 1958, during the last months of President [[Camille Chamoun]]'s term, [[1958 Lebanon crisis|an insurrection]] broke out, instigated by Lebanese Muslims who wanted to make Lebanon a member of the [[United Arab Republic]]. Chamoun requested assistance, and 5,000 [[United States Marines]] were briefly dispatched to Beirut on 15 July. After the crisis, a new government was formed, led by the popular former general [[Fuad Chehab]].

With the [[Black September in Jordan|defeat]] of the [[PLO]] in Jordan, many Palestinian militants relocated to Lebanon, increasing their [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|armed campaign]] against Israel. The relocation of Palestinian bases also led to increasing sectarian tensions between Palestinians versus the Maronites and other Lebanese factions.

In 1975, following increasing sectarian tensions, a full-scale civil war broke out in Lebanon. The [[Lebanese Civil War]] pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the PLO, left-wing Druze and Muslim militias.

In September 1988, the Parliament failed to elect a successor to President Gemayel as a result of differences between the Christians, Muslims, and Syrians. The Arab League Summit of May 1989 led to the formation of a Saudi–Moroccan–Algerian committee to solve the crisis. On 16 September 1989 the committee issued a peace plan which was accepted by all. A ceasefire was established, the ports and airports were re-opened and refugees began to return.<ref name=fco-cpl/>

Lebanon is located in Western Asia between latitudes [[33rd parallel north|33°]] and [[35th parallel north|35° N]] and longitudes [[35th meridian east|35°]] and [[37th meridian east|37° E]]. Its land straddles the "northwest of the [[Arabian plate]]".<ref>Egyptian Journal of Geology – Volume 42, Issue 1 – Page 263, 1998</ref>

Lebanon has a coastline and border of {{convert|225|km}} on the [[Mediterranean sea]] to the west, a {{convert|375|km}} border shared with [[Syria]] to the north and east and a {{convert|79|km}} long border with [[Israel]] to the south.<ref name="enbr">{{cite book | title=Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan – Middle East: region in transition | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | author=Etheredge, Laura S | year=2011| pages=85–159| isbn=978-1-61530-414-1}}</ref> The [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|border]] with the Israeli-occupied [[Golan Heights]] is disputed by Lebanon in a small area called [[Shebaa Farms]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Philps |first=Alan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/lebanon/1343868/Israel%27s-withdrawal-from-Lebanon-given-UN%27s-endorsement.html |title=Israel's Withdrawal from Lebanon Given UN's Endorsement |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=19 June 2000 |accessdate=17 January 2013}}</ref>

Lebanon is divided into four distinct [[Physical geography|physiographic]] regions: the coastal plain, the [[Lebanon Mountains|Lebanon mountain]] range, the [[Beqaa valley]] and the [[Anti-Lebanon mountains]].

The narrow and discontinuous [[coastal plain]] stretches from the Syrian border in the north where it widens to form the [[Akkar]] plain to [[Naqoura|Ras al-Naqoura]] at the border with Israel in the south. The fertile coastal plain is formed of marine sediments and river deposited [[alluvium]] alternating with sandy bays and rocky beaches.
The Lebanon mountains rise steeply parallel to the Mediterranean coast and form a ridge of [[limestone]] and [[sandstone]] that runs for most of the country's length. The mountain range varies in width between {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|56|km|0|abbr=on}}; it is carved by narrow and deep gorges. The Lebanon mountains peak at {{convert|3088|m}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] in [[Qurnat as Sawda']] in [[North Governorate|North Lebanon]] and gradually slope to the south before rising again to a height of {{convert|2695|m}} in [[Mount Sannine]]. The Beqaa valley sits between the Lebanon mountains in the west and the Anti-Lebanon range in the east; it's a part of the [[Great Rift Valley]] system. The valley is {{convert|180|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|10|to|26|km|0|abbr=on}} wide, its fertile soil is formed by alluvial deposits. The Anti-Lebanon range runs parallel to the Lebanon mountains, its highest peak is in [[Mount Hermon]] at {{convert|2814|m}}.<ref name="enbr"/>

The mountains of Lebanon are drained by [[Intermittent stream|seasonal torrents]] and [[perennial stream|rivers]] foremost of which is the {{convert|145|km}} long [[Litani river|Leontes]] that rises in the Beqaa Valley to the west of [[Baalbek]] and empties into the Mediterranean Sea north of Tyre.<ref name="enbr"/> Lebanon has [[List of rivers of Lebanon|16 rivers]] all of which are [[navigability|non navigable]]; 13 rivers originate from [[Mount Lebanon]] and run through the steep gorges and into the [[Mediterranean Sea]], the other three arise in the [[Beqaa Valley]].<ref name=MOTE>{{cite web|last=ECODIT|title=National action plan for the reduction of pollution into the mediterranean sea from land based sources|url=http://smap.ew.eea.europa.eu/media_server/files/C/f/NAP_Med.pdf|publisher=Lebanese ministry of the environment|accessdate=31 January 2012|format=PDF|date=October 2005}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

{{Main|Climate of Lebanon}}

Lebanon has a moderate [[Mediterranean climate]]. In coastal areas, winters are generally cool and rainy whilst summers are hot and humid. In more elevated areas, temperatures usually drop below freezing during the winter with heavy snow cover that remains until early summer on the higher mountaintops.<ref name="enbr"/><ref>(Bonechi et al.)

As a result of longstanding exploitation, few old cedar trees remain in pockets of forests in Lebanon, but there is an active program to conserve and regenerate the forests. The Lebanese approach has emphasized natural regeneration over planting by creating the right conditions for [[germination]] and growth. The Lebanese state has created several nature reserves that contain cedars, including the [[Al Shouf Cedar Nature Reserve|Shouf Biosphere Reserve]], the Jaj Cedar Reserve, the [[Tannourine]] Reserve, the Ammouaa and Karm Shbat Reserves in the Akkar district, and the Forest of the [[Cedars of God]] near [[Bsharri]].<ref>Talhouk, S.

==Environmental issues==
{{Main|Marine environmental issues in Lebanon}}
Beirut and Mount Lebanon have been facing a severe garbage crisis. After the closure of the Bourj Hammoud dump in 1997, the al-Naameh dumpsite was opened by the government in 1998. The al-Naameh dumpsite was planned to contain 2 million tons of waste for a limited period of six years at the most. It was designed to be a temporary solution, while the government would have devised a long-term plan. Sixteen years later al-Naameh was still open and exceeded its capacity by 13 million tons. In July 2015 the residents of the area, already protesting in the recent years, forced the closure of the dumpsite.The inefficiency of the government, as well as the corruption inside of the waste management company Sukleen in charge of managing the garbage in Lebanon, have resulted in piles of garbage blocking streets in Mount Lebanon and Beirut.<ref>{{cite web|last1=chronicle.fanack.com|title=Republic of Rubbish|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/history-past-to-present/republic-of-rubbish/|website=fanack.com|accessdate=12 August 2015}}</ref>

In December 2015, the Lebanese government signed an agreement with Chinook Industrial Mining, part owned by [[Chinook Sciences]], to export over 100,000 tons of untreated waste from  [[Beirut]] and the surrounding area. The waste had accumulated in temporary locations following the government closure of the county's largest land fill site five months earlier. The contract was jointly signed with Howa International which has offices in Holland and Germany. The contract is reported to cost $212 per ton. The waste, which  is compacted and infectious, would have to be sorted and was estimated to be enough to fill 2,000 containers.<ref>[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2015/Dec-28/329219-exportation-plan-was-lebanons-only-option-environment-minister.ashx] Exportation plan was Lebanon's only option.

The plan also stipulates the establishment of landfills in [[Bourj Hammoud]] and Costa Brava, east and south of Beirut respectively. Sukleen trucks began removing piled garbage from Karantina and heading to Naameh. Environment Minister Mohammad Machnouk announced during a chat with activists that more than 8,000 tons of garbage had been collected so far as part of the government's trash plan in only 24 hours. The plan's execution is still ongoing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2016/Mar-21/343245-trash-arrives-at-naameh-under-army-escort.ashx |title=Trash arrives at Naameh under Army escort |work=The Daily Star |date= |accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Esperance Ghanem |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411122651/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/03/lebanon-trash-crisis-government-plan-landfills.html |title=Will short-term solution help Lebanon solve trash crisis? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=21 March 2016 |accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref> In 2017, Human Rights Watch found that Lebanon's garbage crisis, and open burning of waste in particular, was posing a health risk to residents and violating the state's obligations under international law.<ref>{{cite web|author=USA |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/12/01/lebanon-waste-crisis-posing-health-risks |title=Human Rights Watch |work=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=8 December 2018}}</ref>

In September 2018, Lebanon's parliament passed a law that banned open dumping and burning of waste. Despite penalties set in case of violations, Lebanese municipalities have been openly burning the waste, putting the lives of people in danger. In October 2018, [[Human Rights Watch]] researchers witnessed the open burning of dumps in al-Qantara and [[Qabrikha]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/10/18/lebanon-no-action-enforce-new-waste-law|title=Lebanon: No Action to Enforce New Waste Law|accessdate=18 October 2018|publisher=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>

===Law===
There are 18 officially recognized religious groups in Lebanon, each with its own family law legislation and set of religious courts.<ref name="unesco1">{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/SHS/pdf/Women_in_Personal_Status_Laws.pdf |title=Women In Personal Status Laws |format=PDF |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>

The Lebanese legal system is based on the [[Law of France|French system]], and is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] country, with the exception for matters related to personal status (succession, marriage, divorce, adoption, etc.), which are governed by a separate set of laws designed for each sectarian community. For instance, the Islamic personal status laws are inspired by the [[Sharia]] law.<ref name="globalex"/> For Muslims, these tribunals deal with questions of marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance and wills. For non-Muslims, personal status jurisdiction is split: the law of inheritance and wills falls under national civil jurisdiction, while Christian and Jewish religious courts are competent for marriage, divorce, and custody. Catholics can additionally appeal before the [[Roman Rota|Vatican Rota court]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mallat.com/articles/T/The%20Lebanese%20Legal%20System.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516171921/http://www.mallat.com/articles/T/The%20Lebanese%20Legal%20System.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 May 2011 |title=The Lebanese Legal System |author=Chibli Mallat |format=PDF |accessdate=17 January 2013 }}</ref>

The Lebanese court system consists of three levels: courts of first instance, courts of appeal, and the court of cassation. The Constitutional Council rules on constitutionality of laws and electoral frauds. There also is a system of religious courts having jurisdiction over personal status matters within their own communities, with rules on matters such as marriage and inheritance.<ref name="Carnegie">{{Cite journal | publisher=[[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] | last = Carnegie Endowment for International Peace | title = Arab Political Systems: Baseline Information and Reforms – Lebanon | accessdate =4 July 2009 | url = http://www.carnegieendowment.org/files/Lebanon_APS.doc}}</ref>

The financial constraints were also felt: the poverty rate increased with 170.000 Lebanese falling under the poverty threshold. In the period between 2012 and 2014, the public spending increased by $1 billion and losses amounted to $7.5 billion. Expenditures related only to the Syrian refugees were estimated by the Central Bank of Lebanon as $4.5 billion every year.<ref name="chronicle.fanack.com">{{cite web|last1=Fanack|title=Lebanon: Syrian Refugees Cost the Economy $4.5 Billion Every Year|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/lebanon/economy/lebanon-syrian-refugees-cost-the-economy-4-5-billion-every-year/|website=Fanack.com|accessdate=14 July 2015}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Lebanon}}

The culture of Lebanon reflects the legacy of various civilizations spanning thousands of years. Originally home to the [[Canaan]]ite[[Phoenicia|- Phoenicians]], and then subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Assyria]]ns, the [[Persia]]ns, the [[Greeks]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the Arabs, the [[Fatimids]], the Crusaders, the [[Ottoman Turks]] and most recently the French, Lebanese culture has over the millennia evolved by borrowing from all of these groups. Lebanon's diverse population, composed of different ethnic and religious groups, has further contributed to the country's festivals, musical styles and literature as well as cuisine. Despite the ethnic, linguistic, religious and denominational diversity of the Lebanese, they "share an almost common culture".<ref name="StokesJamie">Stokes, Jamie. ''Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East'', Facts On File, 2009, p. 406 {{ISBN|0816071586}}</ref> [[Lebanese Arabic]] is universally spoken while food, music, and literature are deep-rooted "in wider Mediterranean and Arab Levantine norms".<ref name="StokesJamie" />

===Holidays and festivals===
{{Main|Public holidays in Lebanon}}
[[File:Beiteddine Palace InnerCourtyard.jpg|thumb|[[Beiteddine Palace]], venue of the [[Beiteddine Festival]]]]

Lebanon celebrates national and both [[Christianity in Lebanon|Christian]] and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslim]] holidays. Christian holidays are celebrated following both the [[Gregorian Calendar]] and [[Julian Calendar]]. [[Greek Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Greek Orthodox]] (with the exception of Easter), [[Roman Catholicism in Lebanon|Catholics]], [[Protestantism in Lebanon|Protestants]], and [[Melkite Christianity in Lebanon|Melkite]] Christians follow the Gregorian Calendar and thus celebrate Christmas on 25 December. Armenian [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Apostolic]] Christians celebrate Christmas on 6 January, as they follow the Julian Calendar. Muslim holidays are followed based on the Islamic lunar calendar. Muslim holidays that are celebrated include Eid al-Fitr (the three-day feast at the end of the Ramadan month), Eid al-Adha (The Feast of the Sacrifice) which is celebrated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and also celebrates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son to God, the Birth of the Prophet Muhammad, and Ashura (the Shiite Day of Mourning). Lebanon's National Holidays include Workers Day, Independence day, and Martyrs Day.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Lebanese cuisine}}

Lebanese cuisine is similar to those of many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, such as [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], and [[Cyprus]].

The Lebanese national dishes are the [[kibbe]], a meat pie made from finely minced [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] and [[burghul]] (cracked [[wheat]]), and the [[tabbouleh]], a salad made from [[parsley]], [[tomato]]es, and burghul. The national beverage is [[Arak (drink)|arak]], a strong [[anise]]-flavored liquor made from fermented [[grape juice]]. It is usually drunk with water and ice, which turns the clear liquid milky-white, and usually accompanies food. Arak is a strong spirit similar to the Greek ouzo and the Turkish raki.

Lebanese restaurant meals begin with a wide array of [[mezze]] - small savoury dishes, such as dips, salads, and pastries. The mezze are typically followed by a selection of grilled [[meat]] or [[fish]]. In general, meals are finished with [[Arabic coffee]] and fresh [[fruit]], though sometimes a selection of traditional sweets will be offered as well.

[[M'Juhdara]], a thick stew of [[onions]], [[rice]], and [[lentils]], is sometimes considered poor man's fare and is often eaten around [[Lent]] by people in the Lebanese diaspora.

Beirut and its environs contain many restaurants of various national origins. At the same time, [[wine]] is growing in popularity and a number of vineyards currently exist in the [[Bekaa valley]] and elsewhere. [[Beer]] is also highly popular and Lebanon produces a number of local beers, of which [[almaza]] is perhaps the most popular.

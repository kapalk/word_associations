Following the unification of the [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] and [[Nejd]] kingdoms, the new state was named ''al-Mamlakah al-ʻArabīyah as-Suʻūdīyah'' (a transliteration of {{lang|ar|المملكة العربية السعودية}} in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) by royal decree on 23 September 1932 by its founder, Abdulaziz Al Saud ([[Ibn Saud]]).

Arabia underwent an extreme environmental fluctuation in the [[Quaternary]] that led to profound evolutionary and demographic changes.

In the Neolithic period, prominent cultures such as al-Magar whose epicenter lay in modern-day southwestern [[Najd]] flourished. al-Magar could be considered as a "Neolithic Revolution" in human knowledge and handicraft skills.<ref>[http://paleolithic-neolithic.com/overview/al-magar// al-Magar]</ref> The culture is characterized as being one of the world's first to involve the widespread domestication of animals, particularly the horse, during the [[Neolithic]] period.<ref>

In November 2017 hunting scenes showing images of most likely domesticated dogs, resembling the [[Canaan dog]], wearing leashes were discovered in Shuwaymis, a hilly region of northwestern Saudi Arabia.

At the end of the [[4th millennium BC]], Arabia entered the [[Bronze Age]] after witnessing drastic transformations; metals were widely used, and the period was characterized by its 2 m high burials which was simultaneously followed by the existence of numerous temples, that included many free-standing sculptures originally painted with red colours.<ref>طرق التجارة القديمة، روائع آثار المملكة العربية السعودية pp. 156–157</ref>

The earliest sedentary culture in Saudi Arabia dates back to the Ubaid period, upon discovering various pottery sherds at Dosariyah. Initial analysis of the discovery concluded that the eastern province of Saudi Arabia was the homeland of the earliest settlers of Mesopotamia, and by extension, the likely origin of the Sumerians. However, experts such as Joan Oates had the opportunity to see the Ubaid period sherds in eastern Arabia and consequently conclude that the sherds dates to the last two phases of Ubaid period (period three and four), while handful examples could be classified roughly as either Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 2. Thus the idea that colonists from Saudi Arabia had emigrated to southern Mesopotamia and founded the region's first sedentary culture was abandoned.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 175.</ref>

Climatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 176.</ref> The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from Uruk refer to a place called [[Dilmun]], associated in several occasions with copper and in later period it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun.<ref name="Roads of Arabia p. 180"/> Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggests that, in the early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966 an earthworks in Tarout exposed ancient burial field that yielded a large impressive statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.<ref name="Roads of Arabia p. 180"/>

By 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of [[Bahrain]], and a major developed settlements appeared in Bahrain for the first time, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds that dates to this period were discovered.<ref name="Roads of Arabia p. 180"/>

At the end of the 7th century BC an emerging kingdom appeared on the historical theater of north-western Arabia. It started as a Sheikdom of Dedan, which developed into the Kingdom of Lihyan tribe.<ref name="Lihyan p. 192">The State of Lihyan: A New Perspective – p. 192</ref> The earliest attestation of state regality, King of Lihyan, was in the mid-sixth century BC.<ref>J.

The Lihyanites fell into the hands of the [[Nabataeans]] around 65 BC upon their seizure of Hegra then marching to [[Tayma]], and to their capital Dedan in 9 BC. The Nabataeans ruled large portions of north Arabia until their domain was annexed by the Roman Empire.

Ibn Saud avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt, and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid. Following the latter's final defeat, he took the title Sultan of Nejd in 1921. With the help of the Ikhwan, the Hejaz was conquered in 1924–25 and on 10 January 1926, Ibn Saud declared himself King of the [[Hejaz]].<ref>{{cite book |title=A Brief History of Saudi Arabia |author=James Wynbrandt |author2=Fawaz A.

After the conquest of the Hejaz, the Ikhwan leadership's objective switched to expansion of the Wahhabist realm into the British protectorates of [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]], Iraq and Kuwait, and began raiding those territories. This met with Ibn Saud's opposition, as he recognized the danger of a direct conflict with the British. At the same time, the Ikhwan became disenchanted with Ibn Saud's domestic policies which appeared to favor modernization and the increase in the number of non-Muslim foreigners in the country. As a result, they turned against Ibn Saud and, after a two-year struggle, were defeated in 1929 at the [[Battle of Sabilla]], where their leaders were massacred.<ref>{{cite book |title=Inside the Kingdom |author=Robert Lacey |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-09-953905-6 |pages=15–16}}</ref> On 23 September 1932, the two kingdoms of the Hejaz and Nejd were united as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,<ref name="Britannica history" /> and that date is now a national holiday called [[Saudi National Day]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pmu.edu.sa/News/News.aspx?ID=866 |title=History of Saudi Arabia.

{{main|Modern history of Saudi Arabia}}
[[File:Arabia Saudi political.jpg|thumb|Saudi Arabia political map]]
The new kingdom was reliant on limited agriculture and pilgrimage revenues.<ref>{{cite book |title=Afluence and Poverty in the Middle East |author=Mohamad Riad El Ghonemy |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-415-10033-5 |page=56}}</ref> In 1938, vast reserves of [[Petroleum|oil]] were discovered in the [[Eastern Arabia|Al-Ahsa]] region along the coast of the Persian Gulf, and full-scale development of the oil fields began in 1941 under the US-controlled [[Saudi Aramco|Aramco (Arabian American Oil Company)]]. Oil provided Saudi Arabia with economic prosperity and substantial political leverage internationally.<ref name="Britannica history" />

Cultural life rapidly developed, primarily in the Hejaz, which was the center for newspapers and radio. However, the large influx of [[foreign workers in Saudi Arabia]] in the oil industry increased the pre-existing propensity for [[xenophobia]]. At the same time, the government became increasingly wasteful and extravagant. By the 1950s this had led to large governmental deficits and excessive foreign borrowing.<ref name="Britannica history" />

In 1953, [[Saud of Saudi Arabia]] succeeded as the king of Saudi Arabia, on his father's death, until 1964 when he was deposed in favor of his half brother [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]], after an intense rivalry, fueled by doubts in the royal family over Saud's competence. In 1972, Saudi Arabia gained a 20% control in Aramco, thereby decreasing US control over Saudi oil.

In 1973, Saudi Arabia led an oil boycott against the Western countries that supported Israel in the [[Yom Kippur War]] against Egypt and Syria. Oil prices quadrupled.<ref name="Britannica history" /> In 1975, Faisal was assassinated by his nephew, Prince [[Faisal bin Musaid]] and was succeeded by his half-brother [[Khalid of Saudi Arabia|King Khalid]].<ref name="Al-Rasheed 136-137">[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], pp. 136–137</ref>

By 1976, Saudi Arabia had become the largest oil producer in the world.<ref>{{cite book |title=Human Resources Development in Saudi Arabia: Multinationals and Saudization |author=Joy Winkie Viola |year=1986 |isbn=978-0-88746-070-8 |page=37}}</ref> Khalid's reign saw economic and social development progress at an extremely rapid rate, transforming the infrastructure and educational system of the country;<ref name="Britannica history" /> in foreign policy, close ties with the US were developed.<ref name="Al-Rasheed 136-137"/> In 1979, two events occurred which greatly concerned the government,<ref>{{cite book |title=The Muslim world after 9/11 |author=Rabasa, Angel |author2=Benard, Cheryl |author3=Chalk, Peter |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-8330-3712-1 |page=42}}</ref> and had a long-term influence on Saudi foreign and domestic policy. The first was the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]]. It was feared that the country's [[Shi'a Islam in Saudi Arabia|Shi'ite minority]] in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] (which is also the location of the oil fields) might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co-religionists. There were several anti-government uprisings in the region such as the [[1979 Qatif Uprising]].<ref name="Toby Craig Jones 2010 218–219">{{cite book |title=Desert Kingdom: How Oil and Water Forged Modern Saudi Arabia |author=Toby Craig Jones |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-674-04985-7 |pages=218–219}}</ref>

The second event was the [[Grand Mosque Seizure]] in Mecca by Islamist extremists. The militants involved were in part angered by what they considered to be the corruption and un-Islamic nature of the Saudi government.<ref name="Toby Craig Jones 2010 218–219"/> The government regained control of the mosque after 10 days and those captured were executed. Part of the response of the royal family was to enforce a much stricter observance of traditional religious and social norms in the country (for example, the closure of cinemas) and to give the [[Ulema]] a greater role in government.<ref name= Hegghammer24>[[#Hegghammer|Hegghammer]], p. 24</ref> Neither entirely succeeded as [[Islamism]] continued to grow in strength.<ref>{{cite book|title=Saudi Arabia Enters the 21st Century |author=Anthony H. Cordesman |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-275-98091-7 |page=174}}</ref>

In 1980, Saudi Arabia bought out the American interests in Aramco.<ref>{{cite book|title=Oil, Dollars, Debt, and Crises: The Global Curse of Black Gold|author1=Mahmoud A. El-Gamal |author2=Amy Myers Jaffe |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-72070-0|page=41}}</ref>

King Khalid died of a heart attack in June 1982. He was succeeded by his brother, [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]], who added the title "Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques" to his name in 1986 in response to considerable fundamentalist pressure to avoid use of "majesty" in association with anything except God. Fahd continued to develop close relations with the United States and increased the purchase of American and British military equipment.<ref name="Britannica history"/>

The vast wealth generated by oil revenues was beginning to have an even greater impact on Saudi society. It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernisation, urbanization, mass public education and the creation of new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family<ref name="Britannica history"/> leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.<ref>[[#Abir1993|Abir (1993)]], p. 114</ref>

In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 billion in support of [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Iran–Iraq War]].<ref>Robert Fisk (2005) ''[[The Great War For Civilisation]]''. Fourth Estate. p. 23. {{ISBN|1-4000-7517-3}}</ref> However, Saudi Arabia condemned the [[Invasion of Kuwait|Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990]] and asked the US to intervene.<ref name="Britannica history"/> King Fahd allowed American and coalition troops to be stationed in Saudi Arabia. He invited the Kuwaiti government and many of its citizens to stay in Saudi Arabia, but expelled citizens of [[Yemen]] and Jordan because of their governments' support of Iraq. In 1991, Saudi Arabian forces were involved both in bombing raids on Iraq and in the land invasion that helped to liberate Kuwait.

Saudi Arabia's relations with the West began to cause growing concern among some of the ulema and students of sharia law and was one of the issues that led to [[List of militant incidents in Saudi Arabia|an increase in Islamist terrorism]] in Saudi Arabia, as well as [[Islamic terrorism|Islamist terrorist attacks]] in Western countries by Saudi nationals. [[Osama bin Laden]] was a Saudi national (until stripped of his nationality in 1994) and was responsible for the [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings]] in East Africa and the 2000 [[USS Cole bombing]] near the port of Aden, Yemen. 15 of the 19 terrorists involved in [[September 11 attacks]] in New York City, Washington, D.C., and near Shanksville, Pennsylvania were Saudi nationals.<ref>{{cite book |title=Saudi Arabia: Background and U.S. Relations |author=Christopher Blanchard |publisher=United States Congressional Research Service|year=2009 |pages=5–6}}</ref> Many Saudis who did not support the [[Islamist]] terrorists were nevertheless deeply unhappy with the government's policies.<ref>[[#Hegghammer|Hegghammer]], p. 31</ref>

[[File:Oil and Gas Infrastructure Persian Gulf (large).gif|thumb|[[Petroleum|Oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] pipelines in the Middle-East]]
Islamism was not the only source of hostility to the government. Although now extremely wealthy, Saudi Arabia's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent, and has been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited "reforms" were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the "[[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Basic Law]]", which emphasised the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated. It is composed of a chairman and 60 members—all chosen by the King. The King's intent was to respond to dissent while making as few actual changes in the status quo as possible.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Fahd made it clear that he did not have democracy in mind: "A system based on elections is not consistent with our Islamic creed, which [approves of] government by consultation [shūrā]."<ref name="Britannica history" />

In 1995, Fahd suffered a debilitating stroke, and the Crown Prince, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]], assumed the role of ''de facto'' [[regent]], taking on the day-to-day running of the country. However, his authority was hindered by conflict with Fahd's full brothers (known, with Fahd, as the "[[Sudairi Seven]]").<ref>[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], p. 212</ref> From the 1990s, signs of discontent continued and included, in 2003 and 2004, a series of bombings and armed violence in Riyadh, Jeddah, Yanbu and Khobar.<ref name="Cordesman 2009">{{cite book |title=Saudi Arabia: National Security in a Troubled Region |author=Anthony H.

Women were not allowed to take part in the poll.<ref name="Britannica history" />

In 2005, King Fahd died and was succeeded by Abdullah, who continued the policy of minimum reform and clamping down on protests. The king introduced a number of economic reforms aimed at reducing the country's reliance on oil revenue: limited deregulation, encouragement of foreign investment, and privatization. In February 2009, [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|Abdullah]] announced a series of governmental changes to the judiciary, armed forces, and various ministries to modernize these institutions including the replacement of senior appointees in the judiciary and the [[Islamic religious police|Mutaween]] (religious police) with more moderate individuals and the appointment of the country's first female deputy minister.<ref name="Britannica history" />

There has been mounting pressure to reform and modernize the royal family's rule, an agenda championed by King Abdullah both before and after his accession in 2005. The creation of the Consultative Council in the early 1990s did not satisfy demands for political participation, and, in 2003, an annual ''National Dialogue Forum'' was announced that would allow selected professionals and intellectuals to publicly debate current national issues, within certain prescribed parameters. In 2005, the first municipal elections were held. In 2007, the [[Allegiance Council]] was created to regulate the succession.<ref name=Al-Rasheed242>[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], pp. 180, 242–243, 248, 257–258</ref> In 2009, the king made significant personnel changes to the government by appointing reformers to key positions and the first woman to a ministerial post.<ref>

Saudi Arabia is almost unique in giving the [[ulema]] (the body of Islamic religious leaders and jurists) a direct role in government.<ref name= Goldstein118>{{cite book |title=Religion and the State |author=Natalie Goldstein |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-8160-8090-8 |page=118}}</ref> The preferred ulema are of the [[Salafi movement|Salafi]] persuasion.

The primary source of law is the Islamic [[Sharia]] derived from the teachings of the [[Qur'an]] and the [[Sunnah]] (the traditions of the Prophet).<ref name= Campbell/> Saudi Arabia is unique among modern Muslim states in that Sharia is not [[Codification (law)|codified]] and there is no system of [[judicial precedent]], giving judges the power to use independent legal reasoning to make a decision. Saudi judges tend to follow the principles of the [[Hanbali]] school of jurisprudence (or ''[[fiqh]]'') found in pre-modern texts<ref name= Haffner58>{{cite book |title=Shari'a Politics: Islamic Law and Society in the Modern World |author=Robert W.

Because the judge is empowered to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and may apply his personal interpretation of Sharia to any particular case, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases,<ref name="Sharia Inc Courts"/> making predictability of legal interpretation difficult.<ref>{{cite book|author=Oxford Business Group|title=The Report: Saudi Arabia |year=2009 |page=202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMPjxHzG1xQC&pg=PA202|isbn=978-1-902339-00-9|quote=it is not always possible to reach a conclusion on how a Saudi court or judicial committee would view a particular case [because] decisions of a court or a judicial committee have no binding authority with respect to another case, [and] in general there is also no system of court reporting in the Kingdom.}}</ref> The Sharia court system constitutes the basic judiciary of Saudi Arabia and its judges ([[qadi]]) and lawyers form part of the [[ulema]], the country's Islamic scholars.

Royal decrees are the other main source of law; but are referred to as ''regulations'' rather than ''laws'' because they are subordinate to the Sharia.<ref name= Campbell/> Royal decrees supplement Sharia in areas such as labor, commercial and corporate law.

The Saudi system of justice has been criticized for its "ultra-puritanical judges", who are often harsh in their sentencing (with beheading for the crime of witchcraft), but also sometimes overly lenient (for cases of rape or wife-beating) and slow, for example leaving thousands of abandoned women unable to secure a divorce.<ref name=econ-2007>{{cite journal|title=International: Law of God versus law of man; Saudi Arabia|journal=The Economist|date=13 October 2007|url=http://www.economist.com/node/9954500}}</ref><ref name="Economist Cruel">{{Cite news|title=Saudi Arabian justice: Cruel, or just unusual? |url=http://www.economist.com/node/656147 |work=The Economist |date=14 June 2001}}</ref> The system has also been criticized for being arcane,<ref name="Economist Tentative">{{Cite news|title=Tentative steps in Saudi Arabia: The king of Saudi Arabia shows some reformist credentials |url=http://www.economist.com/node/13134598 |work=The Economist |date=17 February 2009}}</ref> lacking in some of the safeguards of justice, and unable to deal with the modern world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Support for shake-up of Saudi justice system |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ec3ad182-72a2-11dc-b7ff-0000779fd2ac.html |newspaper=Financial Times |date=4 October 2007}}</ref>

Even after allowing women to drive and work, public places in Saudi Arabia are still gender-segregated and the kingdom has very strict laws on how unrelated men and women can dine together. In September 2018, a man was arrested by the Saudi authorities for appearing in a video with his female colleague while having breakfast at a hotel, where they both work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/11/middleeast/saudi-arabia-breakfast-arrest-intl/index.html|title=Man arrested in Saudi Arabia for having breakfast with woman|publisher=CNN|accessdate=11 September 2018}}</ref>

[[File:Raif Badawi cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|In 2014, Saudi Arabian writer [[Raif Badawi]] was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for "undermining the regime and officials", "inciting public opinion", and "insulting the judiciary".]]

Western-based organizations such as [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Freedom House]] condemn both the Saudi criminal justice system and its severe punishments. There are no jury trials in Saudi Arabia and courts observe few formalities.<ref>{{cite book |title=Doing business with Saudi Arabia |author=Anthony Shoult|year=2006 |isbn=978-1-905050-06-2 |page=95}}</ref> Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted that a criminal procedure code had been introduced for the first time in 2002, but it lacked some basic protections and, in any case, had been routinely ignored by judges. Those arrested are often not informed of the crime of which they are accused or given access to a lawyer and are subject to abusive treatment and torture if they do not confess. At trial, there is a presumption of guilt and the accused is often unable to examine witnesses and evidence or present a legal defense. Most trials are held in secret.<ref>

Saudi Arabia is widely accused of having one of the worst human rights records in the world. Human rights issues that have attracted strong criticism include the extremely disadvantaged position of women (see [[Saudi Arabia#Women|Women]] below), capital punishment for [[LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia|homosexuality]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/02/24/here-are-the-10-countries-where-homosexuality-may-be-punished-by-death/ |title=Here are the 10 countries where homosexuality may be punished by death |date=24 February 2014 |work=The Washington Post}}</ref> religious discrimination, the lack of religious freedom and the activities of the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|religious police]] (see [[Saudi Arabia#Religion|Religion]] below).<ref name="Sharia Inc175"/> Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN human rights conventions and, in 2004, the government approved the establishment of the [[National Society for Human Rights]] (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR have been limited and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence.<ref>[[#Al-Rasheed|Al-Rasheed]], pp. 250–252</ref>

Saudi Arabia remains one of the very few countries in the world not to accept the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record, the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.<ref>[[#Otto|Otto]], pp. 168, 172</ref> The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom had unsuccessfully<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2014/03/31/dispatches-obama-refuses-talk-human-rights-saudi-arabia |title=Dispatches: Obama Refuses to Talk Human Rights in Saudi Arabia |date=31 March 2014 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}</ref> urged President [[Barack Obama]] to raise human rights concerns with King Abdullah on his March 2014 visit to the Kingdom especially the imprisonments of Sultan Hamid Marzooq al-Enezi, Saud Falih Awad al-Enezi, and [[Raif Badawi]].<ref>[http://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/press-releases/uscirf-urges-president-raise-religious-freedom-saudi-trip "USCIRF Urges President: Raise Religious Freedom on Saudi Trip"].

Tensions have escalated between the Saudi and its allies after the disappearance of [[Jamal Khashoggi]] from the Saudi consulate in [[Istanbul]].

In the wake of Jamal Khashoggi's murder in October 2018, the US secretary of state [[Mike Pompeo]] and the US defence secretary [[Jim Mattis]] have called for a ceasefire in Yemen within 30 days followed by UN-initiated peace talks.

[[Jeremy Hunt]], the UK Foreign Secretary, on his visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE on 12 November 2018, is expected to raise the need for a ceasefire from all sides in the four-year long Yemen civil war. The US called for a ceasefire within 30 days. Prior to his visit, Hunt said, “The only solution is now a political decision to set aside arms and pursue peace. Britain has a unique position, both as pen-holder [lead state for drafting decisions] at the UN Security Council and as a key influencer in the region, so today I am travelling to the Gulf to demand that all sides commit to this process. We are witnessing a manmade humanitarian catastrophe on our watch: now is the window to make a difference, and to get behind both the UN peace process and current UK efforts in the security council.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/12/uk-jeremy-hunt-pressure-saudi-arabia-khashoggi-killing|title=UK piles pressure on Saudi Arabia over Khashoggi killing|accessdate=12 November 2018|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref>

The Saudi military consists of the [[Royal Saudi Land Forces]], the [[Royal Saudi Air Force]], the [[Royal Saudi Navy]], the [[Royal Saudi Air Defense]], the [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]] (SANG, an independent military force), and paramilitary forces, totaling nearly 200,000 active-duty personnel. In 2005 the armed forces had the following personnel: the army, 75,000; the air force, 18,000; air defense, 16,000; the navy, 15,500 (including 3,000 marines); and the SANG had 75,000 active soldiers and 25,000 tribal levies.<ref name="Library of Congress 2006">{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Saudi_Arabia.pdf |title=Country Profile: Saudi Arabia, Sept. 2006 Library of Congress}}</ref> In addition, there is an [[Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah]] military intelligence service.

Saudi Arabia's geography is dominated by the [[Arabian Desert]], associated semi-desert and shrubland (see satellite image) and several mountain ranges and highlands. It is, in fact, a number of linked deserts and includes the {{cvt|647500|km2|sqmi|0}} [[Rub' al Khali]] ("Empty Quarter") in the southeastern part of the country, the world's largest contiguous sand desert.<ref name=Britannica/><ref>{{cite book|title=Saudi Arabia: an environmental overview|year=2008|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-415-41387-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vacv2wy3yd8C&lpg=PA141|author=Vincent, Peter |page=141}}</ref> There are a few lakes in the country but no permanent rivers, however [[wadis]] are very numerous.

On the Red Sea coast, there is a narrow coastal plain, known as the [[Tihamah]] parallel to which runs an imposing escarpment. The southwest province of [['Asir Province|Asir]] is mountainous, and contains the {{cvt|3133|m|ft|0}} [[Jabal Sawda|Mount Sawda]], which is the highest point in the country.<ref name=Britannica />

Except for the southwestern province of [['Asir Region|Asir]], Saudi Arabia has a [[desert climate]] with very high day-time temperatures and a sharp temperature drop at night. Average summer temperatures are around {{cvt|113|°F|0|order=flip}}, but can be as high as {{cvt|129|°F|0|order=flip}}. In the winter the temperature rarely drops below {{cvt|32|°F|0|order=flip}}. In the spring and autumn the heat is temperate, temperatures average around {{cvt|84|°F|0|order=flip}}. Annual rainfall is extremely low. The Asir region differs in that it is influenced by the Indian Ocean [[monsoons]], usually occurring between October and March.

Birds include falcons (which are caught and trained for hunting), eagles, hawks, vultures, [[sandgrouse]], and [[bulbul]]s. There are several species of snakes, many of which are venomous. Saudi Arabia is home to a rich marine life. The Red Sea in particular is a rich and diverse [[ecosystem]]. More than [[Fish of the Red Sea|1200 species of fish]]<ref name="fishbase">{{cite web|url=http://www.fishbase.org/TrophicEco/FishEcoList.php?ve_code=5|title=FishBase|last=Froese|first=Ranier|author2=Pauly, Daniel |accessdate=12 March 2009|year=2009}}</ref> have been recorded in the Red Sea, and around 10% of these are found nowhere else.<ref>{{cite book|last=Siliotti|first=A.|title=Fishes of the red sea|editor=Verona, Geodia|year=2002|isbn=978-88-87177-42-8}}</ref> This also includes 42 species of [[List of deep water fish of the Red Sea|deepwater fish]].<ref name="fishbase"/>

The rich diversity is in part due to the {{cvt|2000|km|mi|-1}} of [[coral reef]] extending along its [[coastline]]; these [[fringing reef]]s are 5000–7000 years old and are largely formed of stony [[acropora]] and [[porites]] corals. The reefs form platforms and sometimes [[lagoon]]s along the coast and occasional other features such as cylinders (such as the [[Blue Hole (Red Sea)]] at [[Dahab]]). These coastal reefs are also visited by [[pelagic]] species of Red Sea fish, including some of the [[List of sharks in the Red Sea|44 species of shark]].
The Red Sea also contains many offshore reefs including several true atolls. Many of the unusual offshore reef formations defy classic (i.e., Darwinian) coral reef classification schemes, and are generally attributed to the high levels of tectonic activity that characterize the area.
Domesticated animals include the legendary [[Arabian horse]], [[Arabian camel]], sheep, goats, cows, donkeys, chickens etc. Reflecting the country's dominant desert conditions, Saudi Arabia's plant life mostly consists of herbs, plants and shrubs that require little water. The [[Date (fruit)|date]] palm (''Phoenix dactylifera'') is widespread.<ref name=Britannica/>

Saudi Arabia maintains a list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government plans to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.

The government has also made an attempt at "[[Saudization|Saudizing]]" the economy, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals with limited success.<ref name=house-161>[[#House|House]], p. 161: "Over the past decade, the government has announced one plan after another to 'Saudize' the economy, but to no avail. The foreign workforce grows, and so does unemployment among Saudis. .... The previous plan called for slashing unemployment to 2.8% only to see it rise to 10.5% in 2009, the end of that plan period. Government plans in Saudi are like those in the old Soviet Union, grandiose but unmet. (Also, as in the old Soviet Union, nearly all Saudi official statistics are unreliable, so economists believe the real Saudi unemployment rate is closer to 40%)"</ref>

Saudi Arabia has had five-year "Development Plans" since 1970. Among its plans were to launch "economic cities" (e.g. [[King Abdullah Economic City]]) to be completed by 2020, in an effort to diversify the economy and provide jobs. {{As of|2013}} four cities were planned.<ref name=MCC>{{cite web|title=Saudi Arabia's Four New Economic Cities|url=http://www.metrocorpcounsel.com/articles/22205/saudi-arabia%E2%80%99s-four-new-economic-cities|website=The Metropolitan Corporate Counsel|accessdate=16 March 2015|date=6 February 2013}}</ref> The King has announced that the per capita income is forecast to rise from $15,000 in 2006 to $33,500 in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://professional.tdctrade.com/content.aspx?data=Professional_content_en&contentid=917452&w_sid=194&w_pid=836&w_nid=10993&w_cid=917452&w_idt=1900-01-01&w_oid=181&w_jid= |title=Construction boom of Saudi Arabia and the UAE |accessdate=7 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011212725/http://professional.tdctrade.com/content.aspx?data=Professional_content_en&contentid=917452&w_sid=194&w_pid=836&w_nid=10993&w_cid=917452&w_idt=1900-01-01&w_oid=181&w_jid= |archivedate=11 October 2007 |website=tdctrade.com |date=2 August 2007}}</ref> The cities will be spread around Saudi Arabia to promote diversification for each region and their economy, and the cities are projected to contribute $150 billion to the GDP.

In addition to petroleum and gas, Saudi also has a significant gold mining sector in the ancient [[Mahd adh Dhahab]] region and significant other mineral industries, an agricultural sector (especially in the southwest but not only) based on vegetables, fruits, dates etc. and livestock, and large number of temporary jobs created by the roughly two million annual ''[[hajj]]'' pilgrims.<ref name="HT2009: 150">[[Saudi Arabia#HT2009|Tripp, ''Culture Shock'', 2009]]: p. 206</ref>

Each year, about a quarter-million young Saudis enter the job market. With the first phase of [[Saudization]] into effect, 70% of sales job are expected to be filled by Saudis.

=== Agriculture ===
{{main|Agriculture in Saudi Arabia}}
[[File:Jabal Al Qara Cave - Al Hassa, Saudi Arabia ജബൽ അൽ ഖാറ ഗുഹ, അൽ ഹസ, സൗദി അറേബ്യ 13.JPG|thumb|[[Al-Hasa]] is known for its palm trees and dates. Al-Hasa has over 30 million palm trees which produce over 100 thousand tons of dates every year.]]

Serious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s. The government launched an extensive program to promote modern farming technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training institutions.
As a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is now completely self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs, including meat, milk and eggs.
The country exports wheat, dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables and flowers to markets around the world. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid.
In addition, Saudi farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources, domestic production of wheat has ended.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia ends domestic wheat production program|url = https://www.world-grain.com/articles/6275-saudi-arabia-ends-domestic-wheat-production-program|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>

The Kingdom likewise has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of 1,800 gallons per cow, one of the highest in the world. The local dairy manufacturing company [[Almarai]] is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|title=Innovation Drive Al-Marai|publisher=Elopak|accessdate=3 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113093305/http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|archivedate=13 November 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Kingdom's most dramatic agricultural accomplishment, noted worldwide, was its rapid transformation from importer to exporter of wheat. In 1978, the country built its first grain silos. By 1984, it had become self-sufficient in wheat. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia began exporting wheat to some thirty countries, including China and the former Soviet Union, and in the major producing areas of Tabuk, Hail and Qasim, average yields reached 3.6 tons per acre.
The Kingdom has, however, stepped up fruit and vegetable production, by improving both agricultural techniques and the roads that link farmers with urban consumers. Saudi Arabia is a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to its neighbors. Among its most productive crops are watermelon, grapes, citrus fruits, onions, squash and tomatoes. At Jizan in the country's well-watered southwest, the Al-Hikmah Research Station is producing tropical fruits including pineapples, paw-paws, bananas, mangoes and guavas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agriculture & Water|url = https://www.saudiembassy.net/agriculture-water |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>

The [[olive]] tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia. In 2018 the Al Jouf Agricultural Development Company received a certificate of merit from [[The Guinness World Records]] for the largest modern olive plantation in the world. The farm covers 7730 hectares and has 5 million olive trees. The Guinness World Records also took into consideration their production capacity of 15000 tonnes of high quality of olive oil, while the kingdom consumes double that.
The Al Jouf farms are located in [[Sakaka]], a city in the north-western part of Saudi Arabia, which is a deeply-rooted in history. Sakaka dates back more than 4,000 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Largest olive tree farm in Saudi Arabia enters Guinness World Records|url = https://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/largest-olive-tree-farm-in-saudi-arabia-enters-guinness-world-records-1.2215802 |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref> The Al Jouf region has millions of olive trees and the expected number is expected to go up to 20 million trees soon.<ref>{{cite web |title=Inside the Saudi olive farm, the largest in the world|url = https://english.alarabiya.net/en/business/economy/2018/05/03/Saudi-olive-tree-farm-sets-Guinness-Records-for-largest-in-the-world.html|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>

Consuming non-renewable groundwater resulted in the loss of an estimated four fifths of the total groundwater reserves by 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia Stakes a Claim on the Nile – Water Grabbers – National Geographic|url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/12/121217-saudi-arabia-water-grabs-ethiopia/ |accessdate=16 September 2015}}</ref>

===Water supply and sanitation===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Saudi Arabia|Irrigation in Saudi Arabia}}

Water supply and sanitation in Saudi Arabia is characterized by significant investments in [[Water desalination|seawater desalination]], water distribution, sewerage and wastewater treatment leading to a substantial increase in access to drinking water and sanitation over the past decades. About 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and 10% from surface water, especially in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital [[Riyadh]], located in the heart of the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the [[Persian Gulf]] over a distance of 467&nbsp;km. Given the substantial [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|oil wealth]], water is provided almost for free. Despite improvements service quality remains poor. For example, in Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days.<ref name="GWI April 2011">Global Water Intelligence: Becoming a world-class water utility, April 2011</ref> Institutional capacity and [[governance]] in the sector are weak, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Since 2000, the government has increasingly relied on the private sector to operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems is being gradually delegated to private companies as well.

===Tourism===
{{Main|Tourism in Saudi Arabia}}

Although most tourism in Saudi Arabia still largely involves religious pilgrimages, there is growth in the leisure tourism sector. According to the [[World Bank]], approximately 14.3 million people visited Saudi Arabia in 2012, making it the world's 19th-most-visited country.<ref>[https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21607898-can-kingdom-attract-more-visitors-wish-you-were-here Tourism in Saudi Arabia: Wish you were here], economist.com.</ref> Tourism is an important component of the [[Saudi Vision 2030]] and according to a report conducted by BMI Research in 2018, both religious and non-religious tourism have significant potential for expansion.<ref>[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/travel-hospitality/387984-tourism-key-to-saudi-arabias-vision-2030-plans Tourism key to Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 plans], arabianbusiness.com</ref>

Saudi [[Wahhabism]] is hostile to any reverence given to historical or religious places of significance for fear that it may give rise to [[Shirk (Islam)|'shirk']] (idolatry), and the most significant historic Muslim sites (in Mecca and Medina) are located in the western Saudi region of [[Hejaz]].<ref name="Arabia: the Cradle of Islam"/> As a consequence, under Saudi rule, an estimated 95% of Mecca's historic buildings, most over a thousand years old, [[Destruction of early Islamic heritage sites in Saudi Arabia|have been demolished]] for religious reasons.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-destruction-of-mecca-saudi-hardliners-are-wiping-out-their-own-heritage-501647.html 'The destruction of Mecca: Saudi hardliners are wiping out their own heritage'], ''The Independent'', 6 August 2005.

Four cultural sites in Saudi Arabia are designated as [[UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]: the archeological site at [[Al Hijr (Kaaba)]]; the [[Turaif district]] in the city of Diriyah; Historic [[Jeddah]], the Gate to [[Mecca]]; and the cave art in the [[Ha'il Region]].

In June 2014, the Council of Ministers approved a law that gives the [[Saudi Commission for Tourism and National Heritage]] the means to protect Saudi Arabia's ancient relics and historic sites. Within the framework of the 2016 National Transformation Program, also known as [[Saudi Vision 2030]], the kingdom allocated 900 million euros to preserve its historical and cultural heritage.<ref>[http://ksamissioneu.net/en/saudi-arabia-to-spend-1bn-on-cultural-heritage/ Saudia Arabia to Spend $1Bn On Cultural Heritage], KSA Mission EU, 30 June 2016</ref> Saudi Arabia also participates in the International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH), created in March 2017, with a contribution of 18.5 million euros.<ref>[https://www.sciencesetavenir.fr/archeo-paleo/archeologie/destruction-du-patrimoine-une-resolution-historique-du-conseil-de-securite_111642 Destruction du patrimoine : une résolution historique du Conseil de Sécurité], Sciences et Avenir, 28 March 2017</ref>

===Dress===
Saudi Arabian dress strictly follows the principles of [[hijab]] (the Islamic principle of [[modesty]], especially in dress). The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's [[desert]] climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by an [[agal]]) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an [[agal]]) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black [[abaya]] or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect for their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.
* [[Ghutrah]] ({{lang-ar|غتره}}) is a traditional [[headdress]] typically worn by [[Arab]] men. It is made of a square of cloth ("scarf"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an [[arid]] climate, to provide protection from direct [[sun exposure]], and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and [[sand]].
* [[Agal]] ({{lang-ar|عقال}}) is an item of [[Arab]] headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the [[Ghutrah]] to hold it in place. The ''agal'' is usually black in colour.
* [[Thawb]] ({{lang-ar|ثوب}}) is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle-length, usually with long sleeves, similar to a [[robe]].
* [[Bisht (clothing)|Bisht]] ({{lang-ar|بشت}}) is a traditional Arabic men's [[cloak]] usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings.
* [[Abaya]] ({{lang-ar|عبائة}}) is a women's garment. It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head. Some women choose to cover their faces with a niqāb and some do not. Some abayas cover the top of the head as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |title=Traditional dress of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |date=29 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115808/http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 }}</ref>

===Arts and entertainment===

[[File:King Abdullah in his youth.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King Abdullah practising [[falconry]], a traditional pursuit in the country]]

During the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom although they were seen as contrary to Wahhabi norms.<ref name="Return of cinema in Saudi Arabia provokes critics">[http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/01/05/return-of-cinema-in-saudi-arabia-provokes-critics/3473/ World Focus]. 5 January 2009</ref> During the [[Islamic revival]] movement in the 1980s, and as a political response to an increase in [[Islamist]] activism including the 1979 [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca]], the government closed all cinemas and theaters. However, with King Abdullah's reforms from 2005, some cinemas have re-opened,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2008/12/saudi-arabia--1.html |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Babylon & Beyond |date=23 December 2008}}</ref> including one in [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology|KAUST]].

From the 18th century onward, [[Wahhabi]] fundamentalism discouraged artistic development inconsistent with its teaching. In addition, Sunni Islamic prohibition of creating representations of people have limited the visual arts, which tend to be dominated by [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric]], [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|floral]], and abstract designs and by [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]]. With the advent of oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rabābah, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the ṭabl (drum) and the ṭār (tambourine). Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the ʿarḍah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines. Bedouin poetry, known as nabaṭī, is still very popular.<ref name=Britannica />

Censorship has limited the development of Saudi literature, although several [[List of Saudi Arabian writers|Saudi novelists and poets]] have achieved critical and popular acclaim in the Arab world—albeit generating official hostility in their home country. These include [[Ghazi Algosaibi]], [[Abdelrahman Munif]], [[Turki al-Hamad]] and [[Rajaa al-Sanea]].<ref name="Guardian2410">{{cite news |author=Trevor Mostyn |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/24/ghazi-algosaibi-obituary |title=Ghazi al-Gosaibi obituary |newspaper=The Guardian |date=24 August 2010 |place=London}}</ref><ref>

[[Saudi Arabian cuisine]] is similar to that of the surrounding countries in the Arabian Peninsula and the wider Arab world, and has influenced and been influenced by Turkish, Indian, Persian, and African food.

[[Kebabs]] and [[falafel]] are popular, as is ''shāwarmā'' ([[shawarma]]), a marinated grilled meat dish of [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[mutton]], or chicken. As in other Arab countries of the Arabian Peninsula, ''machbūs'' ([[kabsa]]), a rice dish with lamb, chicken, fish or [[shrimp]], is among the national dishes as well as the dish [[mandi (food)]]. Flat, unleavened [[taboon bread]] is a staple of virtually every meal, as are [[Date (fruit)|dates]], fresh fruit, yoghurt and [[hummus]]. Coffee, served in the [[Arabic coffee|Arabic style]], is the traditional beverage but tea and various fruit juices are popular as well.<ref name=Britannica/> Arabic coffee is a traditional beverage in Arabian cuisine.

Education is free at all levels. The school system is composed of elementary, intermediate, and secondary schools. A large part of the curriculum at all levels is devoted to Islam, and, at the secondary level, students are able to follow either a religious or a technical track. The rate of literacy is 90.4% among males and is about 81.3% among females.<ref name="CIA World Factbook"/> Classes are segregated by sex. Higher education has expanded rapidly, with large numbers of [[List of universities and colleges in Saudi Arabia|Universities and colleges being founded particularly since 2000]]. Institutions of higher education include the country's first university, [[King Saud University]] founded in 1957, the [[Islamic University of Madinah|Islamic University]] at [[Medina]] founded in 1961, and the [[King Abdulaziz University]] in [[Jeddah]] founded in 1967. [[King Abdullah University of Science and Technology]], known as KAUST, founded recently in 2009. Other colleges and universities emphasize curricula in sciences and technology, military studies, religion, and medicine. Institutes devoted to Islamic studies, in particular, abound.

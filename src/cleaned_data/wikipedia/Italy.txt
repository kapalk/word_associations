The name ''Italia'' originally applied only to a part of what is now [[Southern Italy]],  according to [[Antiochus of Syracuse]], the southern portion of the Bruttium peninsula corresponding to the  modern province of [[Reggio Calabria|Reggio]], and part of the provinces of [[Catanzaro]] and [[Vibo Valentia]]. But by his time [[Oenotria]] and Italy had become synonymous, and the name also applied to most of [[Lucania]] as well. The Greeks gradually came to apply the name "Italia" to a larger region, but the Peninsula and its borders expanded over time.<ref>Pallottino, M., ''History of Earliest Italy'', trans. Ryle, M & Soper, K. in Jerome Lectures, Seventeenth Series, p. 50</ref>

According to [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica]]'', before the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]], the name was used by Greeks to indicate the land between the [[strait of Messina]] and the line connecting the [[gulf of Salerno]] and [[gulf of Taranto]], corresponding roughly to the current region of [[Calabria]]. Later the term was extended by Romans to include the Italian Peninsula up to the [[Rubicon]], a river located between [[Northern Italy|Northern]] and [[Central Italy]].

[[Ancient Rome|Rome]], a settlement around a ford on the river [[Tiber]] in central Italy conventionally [[Founding of Rome|founded]] in 753 BC, was ruled for a period of 244 years by a [[Roman Kingdom|monarchical]] system, initially with sovereigns of [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] and [[Sabines|Sabine]] origin, later by Etruscan kings. The tradition handed down seven kings: [[Romulus]], [[Numa Pompilius]], [[Tullus Hostilius]], [[Ancus Marcius]], [[Tarquinius Priscus]], [[Servius Tullius]] and [[Tarquinius Superbus]]. In 509 BC, the Romans [[Overthrow of the Roman monarchy|expelled the last king]] from their city, favoring a government of the [[SPQR|Senate and the People]] (SPQR) and establishing an [[Roman Republic|oligarchic republic]].

The Italian Peninsula, named [[Roman Italy|Italia]], was consolidated into a single entity during the Roman [[Roman expansion in Italy|expansion]] and conquest of new lands at the expense of [[Roman–Etruscan Wars|Etruscans]], [[Roman–Gallic wars|Celts]], and [[Pyrrhic War|Greeks]]. A [[Socii|permanent association]] with most of the local tribes and cities was formed, and Rome began the conquest of Western Europe, Northern Africa and the [[History of the Middle East#Greek and Roman Empire|Middle East]]. In the wake of [[Julius Caesar]]'s rise and [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|death]] in the first century BC, Rome grew over the course of centuries into a massive [[Roman empire|empire]] stretching from [[Roman Britain|Britain]] to the borders of [[Mesopotamia (Roman province)|Persia]], and engulfing the whole [[Mediterranean]] basin, in which Greek and Roman and many other cultures merged into a unique [[Greco-Roman world|civilisation]]. The long and triumphant reign of the first emperor, [[Augustus]], began a golden age of peace and prosperity. Italy remained the metropole of the empire, and as the homeland of the Romans and the territory of the capital, maintained a special status which made it "not a province, but the ''[[Dominus (title)|Domina]]'' (ruler) of the [[Roman province|provinces]]".<ref>{{cite book |last=Mommsen |first=Theodor |author-link=Theodor Mommsen |year=1855 |title=History of Rome, Book II: From the Abolition of the Monarchy in Rome to the Union of Italy |location=Leipzig |publisher=Reimer & Hirsel |isbn= |title-link=History of Rome (Mommsen) }}</ref> More than [[Pax Romana|two centuries of stability]] followed, during which Italy was referred to as the ''rectrix mundi'' (queen of the world) and ''omnium terrarum parens'' (motherland of all lands).<ref>{{cite book |last= Fear|first=Andrew |date=25 March 2010 |title=Historiae Mundi: Studies in Universal History |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hb6OAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA97&lpg=PA97&q=Rectrix%20mundi%20omnium%20terrarum%20parens  |author-link= |isbn=978-1-4725-1980-1 }}</ref>

In a slow [[Decline of the Roman Empire|decline]] since the third century AD, the Empire split in two in 395 AD.

Invasions of the peninsula caused a chaotic succession of barbarian kingdoms and the so-called "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|dark ages]]". The Lombard kingdom was subsequently absorbed into the [[Frankish Empire]] by [[Charlemagne]] in the late 8th century. The Franks also helped the formation of the [[Papal States]] in central Italy. Until the 13th century, Italian politics was dominated by the relations between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s and the Papacy, with most of the Italian city-states siding with the former ([[Ghibellines]]) or with the latter ([[Guelphs]]) from momentary convenience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nolan|first=Cathal J.|title=The age of wars of religion, 1000–1650 : an encyclopedia of global warfare and civilization|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport (Connecticut)|isbn=978-0-313-33045-2|page=360|edition=1. publ.}}</ref>

The Germanic Emperor and the Roman Pontiff became the [[universal power]]s of medieval Europe. However, the conflict for the [[investiture controversy]] (a conflict over two radically different views of whether secular authorities such as kings, counts, or dukes, had any legitimate role in appointments to ecclesiastical offices) and the clash between Guelphs and Ghibellines led to the end of the Imperial-feudal system in the north of Italy where city-states gained independence. It was during this chaotic era that Italian towns saw the rise of a peculiar institution, the [[medieval commune]]. Given the power vacuum caused by extreme territorial fragmentation and the struggle between the Empire and the [[Holy See]], local communities sought autonomous ways to maintain law and order.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Philip|title=The Italian city-state : from Commune to Signoria|year=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-822585-0|pages=55–77}}</ref> The investiture controversy was finally resolved by the [[Concordat of Worms]]. In 1176 a league of city-states, the [[Lombard League]], defeated the German emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] at the [[Battle of Legnano]], thus ensuring effective independence for most of northern and central Italian cities.

In coastal and southern areas, the [[maritime republics]] grew to eventually dominate the Mediterranean and monopolise trade routes to the [[Orient]]. They were independent thalassocratic city-states, though most of them originated from territories once belonging to the Byzantine Empire. All these cities during the time of their independence had similar systems of government in which the merchant class had considerable power. Although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern [[democracy]], the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement.<ref name=Lane>{{cite book|last=Lane|first=Frederic C.|title=Venice, a maritime republic|year=1991|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-1460-0|page=73|edition=4. print.}}</ref>

The four most prominent maritime republics were [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Amalfi|Amalfi]]. Venice and Genoa were Europe's gateway to trade with the East, and a producer of fine glass, while [[Republic of Florence|Florence]] was a capital of silk, wool, banks and jewellery. The wealth such business brought to Italy meant that large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned. The republics were heavily involved in the [[Crusades]], providing support but most especially taking advantage of the political and trading opportunities resulting from these wars.<ref name=Lane/> Italy first felt huge economic changes in Europe which led to the [[commercial revolution]]: the Republic of Venice was able to [[Sack of Constantinople|defeat the Byzantine Empire]] and finance the voyages of [[Marco Polo]] to Asia; the first universities were formed in Italian cities, and scholars such as [[Thomas Aquinas]] obtained international fame; [[Frederick of Sicily]] made Italy the political-[[dolce stil novo|cultural centre]] of a reign that temporarily included the Holy Roman Empire and the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]; capitalism and banking families emerged in Florence, where [[Dante]] and [[Giotto]] were active around 1300.<ref name="auto"/>

In the 14th and 15th centuries, northern-central Italy was divided into a number of warring [[Italian city-states|city-states]], the rest of the peninsula being occupied by the larger Papal States and the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], referred to here as Naples. Though many of these city-states were often formally subordinate to foreign rulers, as in the case of the [[Duchy of Milan]], which was officially a [[constituent state]] of the mainly Germanic [[Holy Roman Empire]], the city-states generally managed to maintain de facto independence from the foreign sovereigns that had seized Italian lands following the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|collapse]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. The strongest among these city-states gradually absorbed the surrounding territories giving birth to the [[Signoria|Signorie]], regional states often led by merchant families which founded local dynasties. War between the city-states was endemic, and primarily fought by armies of mercenaries known as ''[[Condottiere|condottieri]]'', bands of soldiers drawn from around Europe, especially Germany and Switzerland, led largely by Italian captains.<ref>Jensen 1992, p. 64.</ref> Decades of fighting eventually saw [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] emerged as the dominant players that agreed to the [[Peace of Lodi]] in 1454, which saw relative calm brought to the region for the first time in centuries. This peace would hold for the next forty years.

The [[Renaissance]], a period of vigorous revival of the arts and culture, originated in Italy due to a number of factors: the great wealth accumulated by merchant cities, the [[patronage]] of its dominant families,<ref name="strathern">Strathern, Paul ''The Medici: Godfathers of the Renaissance'' (2003)</ref> and the migration of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek scholars]] and texts to Italy following the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] at the hands of the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name="Britannica1">Encyclopædia Britannica, ''Renaissance'', 2008, O.Ed.</ref><ref name="Harris">Har, Michael H.

The ideas and ideals of the Renaissance soon spread into [[Northern Renaissance|Northern Europe]], [[French Renaissance|France]], [[English Renaissance|England]] and much of Europe. In the meantime, the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]], the new routes to Asia discovered by the Portuguese and the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], all factors which eroded the traditional Italian dominance in trade with the East, caused a long economic decline in the peninsula.

Following the [[Italian Wars]] (1494–1559), ignited by the rivalry between France and Spain, the city-states gradually lost their independence and came under foreign domination, first under Spain (1559 to 1713) and then Austria (1713 to 1796).

The birth of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the [[House of Savoy]] to establish a united kingdom encompassing the entire [[Italian Peninsula]]. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815, the political and social [[Italian unification]] movement, or ''Risorgimento'', emerged to unite Italy consolidating the different states of the peninsula and liberate it from foreign control. A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement. His prolific output of propaganda helped the unification movement stay active.

[[File:Italian-unification.gif|thumb|Animated map of the Italian unification, from 1829 to 1871]]

The most famous member of Young Italy was the revolutionary and general [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], renowned for his extremely loyal followers,<ref>Dennis Mack Smith, ''Modern Italy; A Political History'', (University of Michigan Press, 1997) p. 15. A literary echo may be found in the character of Giorgio Viola in Joseph Conrad's [[Nostromo]].</ref> who led the Italian republican drive for unification in Southern Italy. However, the Northern Italy monarchy of the House of Savoy in the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], whose government was led by [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour]], also had ambitions of establishing a united Italian state. In the context of the [[revolutions of 1848|1848 liberal revolutions]] that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful [[First Italian War of Independence|first war of independence]] was declared on [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]]. The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] of 1859, with the aid of [[Second French Empire|France]], resulting in liberating [[Lombardy]].

In 1860–1861, Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily (the [[Expedition of the Thousand]]),<ref>Mack Smith, Denis (1997). ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. {{ISBN|0-472-10895-6}}</ref> while the House of Savoy troops occupied the central territories of the Italian peninsula, except Rome and part of Papal States. [[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day|title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day|date=2017-03-17|access-date=2017-07-17|language=en}}</ref> Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.

In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome.  Victor Emmanuel, Garibaldi, Cavour and Mazzini have been referred as Italy's ''Four Fathers of the Fatherland''.<ref name="scholar and patriot"/>

===Monarchical period===

The new Kingdom of Italy obtained [[Great Power]] status. The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.

In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society. Starting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]], [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and later [[Italian Libya|Libya]] and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] under its rule.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), p. 49.)</ref> From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China; on 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]].

Italy, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the "[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]" top Allied powers. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99'', all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian defensive victories in major battles, such as on [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] and in a series of battles on the [[Battle of Monte Grappa|Piave river]]. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory<ref>Burgwyn, H.

During the war, more than 650,000 Italian soldiers and as many civilians died<ref>{{cite book|title=La Salute pubblica in Italia durante e dopo la Guerra|last=Mortara|first=G|year=1925|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=}}</ref> and the kingdom went to the brink of bankruptcy. Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as "[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].

=== Fascist regime ===
{{Main|Italian Fascism|Military history of Italy during World War II}}
[[File:Benito Mussolini colored.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italian|Fascist Italy]]]]
The [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'état|coup]]  named the "[[March on Rome]]" which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].

In 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]] and eastern fronts, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Soviet Union]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].

The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions.

An [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] began in July 1943, leading to the collapse of the Fascist regime and the fall of Mussolini on [[25 Luglio|25 July]]. Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.

In the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. The post-armistice period saw the rise of a large [[italian civil war|anti-fascist resistance movement]], the ''[[Resistenza]]''.

The [[Constitution of Italy|Republican Constitution]] was approved on 1 January 1948. Under the [[Treaty of Peace with Italy, 1947|Treaty of Peace with Italy]] of 1947, most of [[Julian March]] was lost to [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and, later, the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] was divided between the two states. Italy also lost all of its colonial possessions, formally ending the [[Italian Empire]]. In 1950, Italian Somaliland was made a [[Trust Territory of Somaliland|United Nations Trust Territory]] under Italian administration until 1 July 1960.

Fears in the Italian electorate of a possible Communist takeover proved crucial for the first universal suffrage electoral outcome on [[Italian general election, 1948|18 April 1948]], when the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], under the leadership of [[Alcide De Gasperi]], obtained a landslide victory. Consequently, in 1949 Italy became a member of [[NATO]]. The [[Marshall Plan]] helped to revive the Italian economy which, until the late 1960s, enjoyed a period of sustained economic growth commonly called the "[[Italian economic miracle|Economic Miracle]]". In 1957, Italy was a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), which became the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993.

From the late 1960s until the early 1980s, the country experienced the [[Years of Lead (Italy)|Years of Lead]], a period characterised by economic crisis (especially after the [[1973 oil crisis]]), widespread social conflicts and terrorist massacres carried out by opposing extremist groups, with the alleged involvement of US and Soviet intelligence.<ref>{{cite web | title=Commissione parlamentare d'inchiesta sul terrorismo in Italia e sulle cause della mancata individuazione dei responsabili delle stragi (Parliamentary investigative commission on terrorism in Italy and the failure to identify the perpetrators) | year=1995 | accessdate=2 May 2006 | url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060819211212/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/report_ital_senate.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 19 August 2006|language=it}}</ref><ref name="Docs">{{en icon}} / {{it icon}} / {{fr icon}} /{{de icon}} {{cite web|title=Secret Warfare: Operation Gladio and NATO's Stay-Behind Armies |accessdate=2 May 2006 |publisher=Swiss Federal Institute of Technology / International Relation and Security Network |url=http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm#Documents |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060425182721/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/collections/coll_gladio.htm |archivedate=25 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html |title=Clarion: Philip Willan, Guardian, 24 June 2000, p. 19 |publisher=Cambridgeclarion.org |date=24 June 2000 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329113138/http://www.cambridgeclarion.org/press_cuttings/us.terrorism_graun_24jun2000.html |archivedate=29 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Years of Lead culminated in the assassination of the Christian Democrat leader [[Aldo Moro]] in 1978 and the [[Bologna massacre|Bologna railway station massacre]] in 1980, where 85 people died.

In the 1980s, for the first time since 1945, two governments were led by non-Christian-Democrat premiers: one republican ([[Giovanni Spadolini]]) and one socialist ([[Bettino Craxi]]); the Christian Democrats remained, however, the main government party. During Craxi's government, the economy recovered and Italy became the world's fifth largest industrial nation, after it gained the entry into the [[G7]] Group in '70s. However, as a result of his spending policies, the Italian national debt skyrocketed during the Craxi era, soon passing 100% of the country's GDP.


Italy faced several terror attacks between 1992–93 perpetrated by the [[Sicilian Mafia]] as a consequence of several life sentences pronounced during the "[[Maxi Trial]]", and of the new anti-mafia measures launched by the government. In 1992, two major dynamite attacks killed the judges [[Giovanni Falcone]] (23 May in the [[Capaci bombing]]) and [[Paolo Borsellino]] (19 July in the [[Via D'Amelio bombing]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.corriere.it/International/english/articoli/2012/03/08/borsellino.shtml|title=New Arrests for Via D'Amelio Bomb Attack|publisher=corriere.it|date=8 March 2012}}</ref> One year later (May–July 1993), tourist spots were attacked, such as the [[Via dei Georgofili bombing|Via dei Georgofili]] in Florence, [[Via Palestro massacre|Via Palestro]] in Milan, and the Piazza [[San Giovanni in Laterano]] and Via San Teodoro in Rome, leaving 10 dead and 93 injured and causing severe damage to cultural heritage such as the [[Uffizi Gallery]].

In the late 2000s, Italy was severely hit by the [[Great Recession]]. From 2008 to 2013, the country suffered 42 months of GDP recession. The economic crisis was one of the main problems that forced Berlusconi to [[Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi|resign]] in 2011.

{{Main|Geography of Italy}}

[[File:Italy topographic map-blank.svg|thumb|left|Topographic map of Italy]]
Italy is located in [[Southern Europe]], between latitudes [[35th parallel north|35°]] and [[47th parallel north|47° N]], and longitudes [[6th meridian east|6°]] and [[19th meridian east|19° E]]. To the north, Italy borders [[France]], [[Switzerland]], [[Austria]], and [[Slovenia]] and is roughly delimited by the [[Alps|Alpine watershed]], enclosing the [[Po Valley]] and the [[Venetian Plain]]. To the south, it consists of the entirety of the [[Italian Peninsula]] and the two [[Mediterranean islands]] of [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]] (the two [[Mediterranean islands#By area|biggest islands]] of the Mediterranean), in addition to many smaller islands. The sovereign states of [[San Marino]] and the [[Vatican City]] are [[Enclave and exclave|enclaves]] within Italy,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/521449/San-Marino |title=San Marino |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2012 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-17994868|title=Vatican country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-08-24|language=en-GB}}</ref> while [[Campione d'Italia]] is an Italian [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]] in Switzerland.<ref>http://demo.istat.it/index_e.html [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] demographics</ref>

The country's total area is {{convert|301230|km²|0|abbr=out}}, of which {{convert|294020|km²|0|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|7210|km²|0|abbr=on}} is water.<ref name=Area>[https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/137001 Istat - Principali dimensioni geostatistiche  e grado di urbanizzazione del bel paese (Italian)]</ref> Including the islands, Italy has a coastline and border of {{convert|7600|km|0|abbr=off}} on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Ionian Sea|Ionian]], [[Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian]] seas ({{convert|740|km|0|abbr=on}}), and borders shared with France ({{convert|488|km|0|abbr=on}}), Austria ({{convert|430|km|0|abbr=on}}), Slovenia ({{convert|232|km|0|abbr=on}}) and Switzerland ({{convert|740|km|0|abbr=on}}).

The [[Apennine Mountains]] form the peninsula's backbone, and the [[Alps]] form most of its northern boundary, where Italy's highest point is located on [[Monte Bianco]] ({{convert|4,810|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).<ref group=note>Official French maps show the border detouring south of the main summit, and claim the highest point in Italy is Mont Blanc de Courmayeur ({{convert|4,748|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), but these are inconsistent with an 1861 convention and topographic watershed analysis.</ref> The [[Po river|Po]], Italy's longest river ({{convert|652|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=off}}), flows from the Alps on the western border with France and crosses the [[Padan plain]] on its way to the [[Adriatic Sea]].

Although the country includes the Italian peninsula, adjacent islands, and most of the southern Alpine basin, some of Italy's territory extends beyond the Alpine basin and some islands are located outside the [[Eurasia]]n continental shelf. These territories are the ''comuni'' of: [[Livigno]], [[Sexten]], [[Innichen]], [[Toblach]] (in part), [[Chiusaforte]], [[Tarvisio]], [[Graun im Vinschgau]] (in part), which are all part of the [[Danube#Drainage basin|Danube's drainage basin]], while the [[Lago di Lei|Val di Lei]] constitutes part of the [[Rhine]]'s basin and the islands of [[Lampedusa]] and [[Lampione]] are on the African [[continental shelf]].

Most of [[rivers of Italy]] drain either into the Adriatic Sea, such as the [[Po (river)|Po]], [[Piave (river)|Piave]], [[Adige]], [[Brenta (river)|Brenta]], [[Tagliamento]], and [[Reno River|Reno]], or into the Tyrrhenian, like the [[Arno]], [[Tiber]] and [[Volturno]]. The waters from some border municipalities ([[Livigno]] in [[Lombardy]], [[Innichen]] and [[Sexten]] in [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]]) drain into the [[Black Sea]] through the basin of the [[Drava]], a [[tributary]] of the [[Danube]], and the waters from the [[Lago di Lei]] in Lombardy drain into the [[North Sea]] through the basin of the [[Rhine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comuni-italiani.it/fiumi/ |title=List of Italian rivers |publisher=comuni-italiani.it |accessdate=30 July 2018}}</ref>

=== Volcanology ===
{{see also|Volcanology of Italy}}
[[File:Mt Etna and Catania1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Mount Etna]] is an active stratovolcano in Sicily.]]
The country is situated at the meeting point of the Eurasian Plate and the African Plate, leading to considerable [[List of earthquakes in Italy|seismic]] and [[Volcanism in Italy|volcanic activity]]. There are [[List of volcanoes in Italy|14 volcanoes in Italy]], four of which are active: [[Mount Etna|Etna]] (the traditional site of [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]'s smithy), [[Stromboli]], [[Vulcano]] and [[Vesuvius]]. The latter one is the only active volcano in mainland Europe and is most famous for the destruction of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculanum]] in the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption in 79 AD]]. Several islands and hills have been created by volcanic activity, and there is still a large active [[caldera]], the [[Campi Flegrei]] north-west of Naples.

The high volcanic and magmatic neogenic activity is subdivided into provinces:
* Magmatic Tuscan ([[Monti Cimini]], [[Tolfa]] and [[Amiata]]);
* Magmatic Latium ([[Monti Volsini]], [[Vico nel Lazio]], [[Colli Albani]], [[Roccamonfina]]);
[[File:Vesuvius from Monte Somma (Panorama II).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Mount Vesuvius]], as seen from the [[Mount Somma]].]]
* Ultra-alkaline Umbrian Latium District ([[San Venanzo]], Cupaello and [[Polino]]);
* Vulcanic bell (Vesuvius, [[Campi Flegrei]], [[Ischia]]);
* Windy arch and Tyrrhenian basin ([[Aeolian Islands]] and Tyrrhenian [[seamounts]]);
* African-Adriatic Avampa ([[Channel of Sicily]], [[Graham Island (Mediterranean Sea)|Graham Island]], Etna and [[Mount Vulture]]).<ref name=Scro>{{Harvnb|Scrocca et al.|ref=cidScro}}.</ref>

Until the 1950s, Italy was the first and only country to exploit geothermal energy to produce electricity in the [[Larderello]] area, and later in the [[Mount Amiata]] area. The high geothermal gradient that forms part of the peninsula makes potentially exploitable also other provinces: research carried out in the 1960s and 1970s identifies potential geothermal fields in Lazio and Tuscany, as well as in most volcanic islands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventario delle risorse geotermiche nazionali|publisher=UNMIG|date=2011|url=http://unmig.sviluppoeconomico.gov.it/unmig/geotermia/inventario/inventario.asp|accessdate=14 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722034736/http://unmig.sviluppoeconomico.gov.it/unmig/geotermia/inventario/inventario.asp|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Isola di Levanzo, Sicilia, Italia.jpg|thumb|[[Southern Italy]] has a Mediterranean climate ([[Levanzo]] island pictured).]]

Because of the great longitudinal extension of the peninsula and the mostly mountainous internal conformation, the climate of Italy is highly diverse. In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.<ref>Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.</ref><ref>Thomas A. Blair, ''Climatology: General and Regional'', Prentice Hall pp. 131–132</ref>

The coastal areas of [[Liguria]], [[Tuscany]] and most of the [[Southern Italy|South]] generally fit the [[Mediterranean climate]] stereotype ([[Köppen climate classification]] Csa). Conditions on peninsular coastal areas can be very different from the interior's higher ground and valleys, particularly during the winter months when the higher altitudes tend to be cold, wet, and often snowy. The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to
{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south. Summers can be hot and humid across the country, particularly in the south while northern and central areas can experience occasional strong thunderstorms from spring to autumn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate Atlas of Italy|url=http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng|publisher=Network of the Air Force Meteorological Service|accessdate=30 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114223307/http://clima.meteoam.it/atlanteClimatico.php?ling=eng|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Italy}}

Italy has been a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] since 2 June 1946, when the monarchy was abolished by a [[Italian constitutional referendum, 1946|constitutional referendum]]. The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943–1946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205–222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}</ref>

Italy has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confindence or no confidence in Parliament.

[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]

The prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]&nbsp;– which holds effective executive power&nbsp;– and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].

Another difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html|title=About us – Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica|website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]]. In addition, the Italian Senate is characterised also by a small number of [[senator for life|senators for life]], appointed by the President "for outstanding patriotic merits in the social, scientific, artistic or literary field". Former Presidents of the Republic are ''ex officio'' life senators.

Italy's three major political parties are the [[Five Star Movement]], the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Lega Nord|Lega]]. During the 2018 general election these three parties won 614 out of 630 seats available in the Chamber of Deputies and 309 out of 315 in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thelocal.it/20180321/italy-new-parliament|title=Italy's new parliament is younger, more diverse and more female|date=21 March 2018}}</ref> Berlusconi's [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] which formed a centre-right coalition with Matteo Salvini's [[Northern League (Italy)|Northern League]] and Giorgia Meloni's [[Brothers of Italy]] won most of the seats without getting the majority in parliament.  The rest of the seats were taken by [[Five Star Movement]], Matteo Renzi's [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] along with Achammer and Panizza's [[South Tyrolean People's Party]] & [[Trentino Tyrolean Autonomist Party]] in a centre-left coalition and the independent [[Free and Equal (Italy)|Free and Equal]] party.

=== Law and criminal justice ===
{{Main|Law of Italy|Judiciary of Italy}}
[[File:Courthouse facade, Rome, Italy.jpg|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]]]]

The Italian judicial system is based on [[Roman law]] modified by the [[Napoleonic code]] and later statutes. The [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] is the highest court in Italy for both criminal and civil appeal cases. The [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] (''Corte Costituzionale'') rules on the conformity of laws with the constitution and is a post–World War II innovation. Since their appearance in the middle of the 19th century, [[Organized crime in Italy|Italian organised crime]] and criminal organisations have infiltrated the social and economic life of many regions in [[Southern Italy]], the most notorious of which being the [[Sicilian Mafia]], which would later expand into some foreign countries including the United States.

==== Law enforcement ====
{{Main|Law enforcement in Italy}}
[[File:Alfa-Romeo159-Carabinieri-di-Roma.JPG|thumbnail|An [[Alfa Romeo]] vehicle of the [[Carabinieri]] corps]]

Law enforcement in Italy is provided by multiple police forces, five of which are national, Italian agencies.
The [[Polizia di Stato]] (State Police) is the civil national police of Italy. Along with patrolling, investigative and law enforcement duties, it oversees the security of transportations. The [[Carabinieri]] is the common name for the Arma dei Carabinieri, a [[Gendarmerie]] that also serves as the military police for the Italian armed forces.

The [[Guardia di Finanza]], (English: Financial Guard) is a corps under the authority of the Minister of Economy and Finance, with a role as police force. The Corps controls financial, economic, judiciary and public safety.
The Polizia Penitenziaria (Prison Guards, literally Penitentiary Police) operate the Italian prison system and handle the transportation of inmates.

Italy is a founding member of the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC), now the [[European Union]] (EU), and of [[NATO]]. Italy was admitted to the United Nations in 1955, and it is a member and a strong supporter of a wide number of international organisations, such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]]/[[World Trade Organization]] (GATT/WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Initiative]]. Its recent or upcoming turns in the rotating presidency of international organisations include the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in 2018, the [[G7]] in 2017 and the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU Council]] from July to December 2014. Italy is also a recurrent [[List of members of the United Nations Security Council|non-permanent member]] of the [[UN Security Council]], the most recently in 2017.

Italy strongly supports multilateral international politics, endorsing the United Nations and its [[international security]] activities. {{As of|2013}}, Italy was deploying 5,296 troops abroad, engaged in 33 UN and NATO missions in 25 countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Missioni/Attivita' Internazionali DAL 1 October 2013 AL 31 December 2013 – Situazione AL 11.12.2013|url=http://www.difesa.it/OperazioniMilitari/Documents/SIT%20ANNO%202013%20al%2011%20dicembre%202013.pdf|publisher=Italian Ministry of Defence|accessdate=27 January 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201175427/http://www.difesa.it/OperazioniMilitari/Documents/SIT%20ANNO%202013%20al%2011%20dicembre%202013.pdf|archivedate=1 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Italy deployed troops in support of UN peacekeeping missions in [[UNITAF|Somalia]], [[United Nations Operation in Mozambique|Mozambique]], and [[United Nations Integrated Mission in East Timor|East Timor]] and provides support for NATO and UN operations in [[IFOR|Bosnia]], [[Kosovo Force|Kosovo]] and [[Operation Sunrise (Albania)|Albania]].

Through the centuries, Italy has fostered the scientific community that produced many major discoveries in physics and the other sciences. During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404–1472) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564–1642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].<br>
Other astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625–1712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835–1910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736–1813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 – c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501–1576) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901–1954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segrè]] (1905–1989) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905–1993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]],.<ref>Lucia Orlando, "Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the" New Tasks" of Physics in Italy."

Other prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]).

At the end of 2013, Italy had 60,782,668 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|title=National demographic balance, 2013|url=http://www.istat.it/it/files/2014/06/Bilanciodemografico_2013_def.pdf?title=Bilancio+demografico+nazionale+-+16%2Fgiu%2F2014+-+Testo+integrale.pdf|publisher=[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Istat]]|accessdate=1 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006153822/http://www.istat.it/it/files/2014/06/Bilanciodemografico_2013_def.pdf?title=Bilancio+demografico+nazionale+-+16%2Fgiu%2F2014+-+Testo+integrale.pdf|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The resulting population density, at {{convert|202|PD/km2}}, is higher than that of most Western European countries. However, the distribution of the population is widely uneven. The most densely populated areas are the Po Valley (that accounts for almost a half of the national population) and the metropolitan areas of Rome and Naples, while vast regions such as the Alps and Apennines highlands, the plateaus of Basilicata and the island of Sardinia are very sparsely populated.

The population of Italy almost doubled during the 20th century, but the pattern of growth was extremely uneven because of large-scale internal migration from the rural South to the industrial cities of the North, a phenomenon which happened as a consequence of the [[Italian economic miracle]] of the 1950–1960s. High fertility and birth rates persisted until the 1970s, after which they started to decline. The population rapidly [[population ageing|aged]].

Because of recent immigration, Italy has sizeable populations whose native language is not Italian, nor a regional language. According to the [[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|Italian National Institute of Statistics]], [[Romanian people|Romanian]] is the most common mother tongue among foreign residents in Italy: almost 800,000 people speak Romanian as their first language (21.9% of the foreign residents aged 6 and over).

Italy has more [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Italy|World Heritage Sites]] ([[Table of World Heritage Sites by country|54]]) than any other country in the world, and has rich collections of art, culture and literature from many periods. The country has had a broad cultural influence worldwide, also because numerous Italians emigrated to other places during the [[Italian diaspora]].

Italy is known for its considerable architectural achievements,<ref>[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp Architecture in Italy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115053940/http://www.justitaly.org/italy/italy-architecture.asp |date=15 January 2012 }}, ItalyTravel.com</ref> such as the construction of arches, domes and similar structures during [[ancient Rome]], the founding of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance architectural movement]] in the late-14th to 16th centuries, and being the homeland of [[Palladianism]], a style of construction which inspired movements such as that of [[Neoclassical architecture]], and influenced the designs which noblemen built their country houses all over the world, notably in the UK, Australia and the US during the late 17th to early 20th centuries. Several of the finest works in Western architecture, such as the [[Colosseum]], the [[Milan Cathedral]] and [[Florence cathedral]], the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] and the building designs of [[Venice]] are found in Italy.

Italy has a very broad and diverse architectural style, which cannot be simply classified by period, but also by region, because of Italy's division into several regional states until 1861. This has created a highly diverse and eclectic range in architectural designs. Italian architecture has also widely influenced the architecture of the world. British architect [[Inigo Jones]], inspired by the designs of Italian buildings and cities, brought back the ideas of Italian Renaissance architecture to 17th-century England, being inspired by [[Andrea Palladio]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jones_inigo.shtml |title=History – Historic Figures: Inigo Jones (1573–1652) |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=12 March 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821112543/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/jones_inigo.shtml |archivedate=21 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Additionally, [[Italianate architecture]], popular abroad since the 19th century, was used to describe foreign architecture which was built in an Italian style, especially modelled on [[Renaissance architecture]].

Along with pre-historic architecture, the first people in Italy to truly begin a sequence of designs were the Greeks and the Etruscans, progressing to classical Roman,<ref>Sear, Frank. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rkdt_p6uvw0C&pg=PA10&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Roman architecture.''] Cornell University Press, 1983. p. 10. Web. 23 September 2011.</ref> then to the revival of the classical Roman era during the Renaissance and evolving into the Baroque era. The Christian concept of a Basilica, a style of church architecture that came to dominate the early Middle Ages, was invented in Rome. They were known for being long, rectangular buildings, which were built in an almost ancient Roman style, often rich in mosaics and decorations. The early Christians' art and architecture was also widely inspired by that of the pagan Romans; statues, mosaics and paintings decorated all their churches.<ref name=byzan>[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/christian-byzanthine.asp Italy Architecture: Early Christian and Byzanthine], ItalyTravel.com</ref> [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], begun about A.D. 330, was probably the first significant early Christian basilica. Old St. Peter's stood on the site of the present [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Vatican City, the largest church of Christendom.<ref name=byzan/> The first significant buildings in the medieval Romanesque style were churches built in Italy during the 800's. Several outstanding examples of the Byzantine architectural style of the Middle East were also built in Italy. Byzantine architecture was also widely diffused in Italy. The Byzantines kept Roman principles of architecture and art alive, and the most famous structure from this period is the [[St Mark's Basilica|Basilica of St. Mark]] in Venice.

In between the Byzantine period and the Gothic period was the Romanesque movement, which went from approximately 800 AD to 1100 AD. This was one of the most fruitful and creative periods in Italian architecture, with several masterpieces, such as the Leaning Tower of Pisa in the [[Piazza dei Miracoli]], and the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] in Milan were built. It was known for its usage of the Roman arches, stained glass windows, and also its curved columns which commonly featured in cloisters. The main innovation of Italian Romanesque architecture was the vault, which had never been seen before in the history of Western architecture.<ref name=romanesque>[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/romanesque.asp Italy Architecture: Romanesque], ItalyTravel.com</ref>

The greatest flowering of Italian architecture took place during the Renaissance. In Florence the new architectural style had its beginning, consciously brought to being by particular architects who sought to revive the order of a past Golden Age. [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] made great contributions to architectural design with his dome for the Cathedral of Florence, a feat of engineering that had not been accomplished since antiquity, and he is also known for the development of the mathematical technique of linear perspective in art which governed pictorial depictions of space until the late 19th century and influenced the rise of modern science.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Italian Renaissance Art|last=Campbell|first=Stephen J|last2=Cole|first2=Michael Wayne|publisher=Thames & Hudson Inc|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=95–97}}</ref>. [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was another early Renaissance architect whose theories and designs had an enormous influence on later architects.<ref>Davis, John A. "Italy." ''World Book Advanced''. World Book, 2011. Web. 23 September 2011.</ref>
A popular achievement of Italian Renaissance architecture was St. Peter's Basilica, originally designed by [[Donato Bramante]] in the early 16th century. Also, Andrea Palladio influenced architects throughout western Europe with the villas and palaces he designed in the middle and late 16th century; he is widely considered to be one of the most influential individuals in the history of architecture, and the city of [[Vicenza]], with its twenty-three buildings designed by Palladio, and twenty-four [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto]] are listed by UNESCO as part of a World Heritage Site named [[City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto]].<ref>http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/712bis</ref>

The Baroque period produced several outstanding Italian architects in the 17th century, especially known for their churches. The most original work of all late Baroque and Rococo architecture is the [[Palazzina di caccia di Stupinigi]], dating back to 18th century.<ref>R. De Fusco, ''A thousand years of architecture in Europe'', pg. 443.</ref> [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] began in 1752 the construction of the [[Royal Palace of Caserta]].

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries Italy was affected by the Neoclassical architectural movement. Everything from villas, palaces, gardens, interiors and art began to be based on Roman and Greek themes.<ref name=Neoclassic>[http://www.justitaly.org/italy/architecture/neoclassicism.asp Italy Architecture: Neoclassicism], ItalyTravel.com</ref>

During the Fascist period, the so-called "[[Novecento movement]]" flourished, based on the rediscovery of imperial Rome, with figures such as [[Gio Ponti]] and [[Giovanni Muzio]]. [[Marcello Piacentini]], responsible for the urban transformations of several cities in Italy and remembered for the disputed [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome, devised a form of simplified Neoclassicism. Numerous modern Italian architects, such as [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Renzo Piano]], [[Massimiliano Fuksas]], and [[Gae Aulenti]] are famous worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/topic/person/renzo-piano|title=Renzo Piano|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=20 August 2017}}</ref>

The history of Italian visual art is one of the most important parts of [[Western painting]] history. [[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. The only surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy. Such painting can be grouped into four main "styles" or periods<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=art-and-archaeology.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726163006/http://art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |archivedate=26 July 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'œil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |title=Roman Wall Painting |publisher=accd.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319123717/http://www.accd.edu/sac/vat/arthistory/arts1303/Rome4.htm |archivedate=19 March 2007 |df= }}</ref>

Panel painting becomes more common during the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period, under the heavy influence of Byzantine icons. Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto on, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. They are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].

In the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]]. 
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484-1486), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]], Florence]]
In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]]. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with [[Antonio Canova]]'s nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.

In the 19th century, major Italian [[Romantic painting|Romantic]] painters were [[Francesco Hayez]], [[Giuseppe Bezzuoli]] and [[Francesco Podesti]]. [[Impressionism]] was brought from France to Italy by the ''[[Macchiaioli]]'', led by [[Giovanni Fattori]], and [[Giovanni Boldini]]; [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] by [[Gioacchino Toma]] and [[Giuseppe Pellizza da Volpedo]]. In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture. Futurism was succeeded by the metaphysical paintings of [[Giorgio de Chirico]], who exerted a strong influence on the [[Surrealists]] and generations of artists to follow.

Another Italian voice originated in Sicily. At the court of Emperor Frederick II, who ruled the Sicilian kingdom during the first half of the 13th century, lyrics modelled on Provençal forms and themes were written in a refined version of the local vernacular. The most important of these poets was the notary [[Giacomo da Lentini]], inventor of the [[sonnet]] form, though the most famous early sonneteer was [[Petrarch]].<ref>Ernest Hatch Wilkins, ''The invention of the sonnet, and other studies in Italian literature'' (Rome: Edizioni di Storia e letteratura, 1959), 11–39</ref>

[[Guido Guinizelli]] is considered the founder of the ''[[Dolce Stil Novo]]'', a school that added a philosophical dimension to traditional love poetry. This new understanding of love, expressed in a smooth, pure style, influenced [[Guido Cavalcanti]] and the [[Florence|Florentine]] poet [[Dante Alighieri]], who established the basis of the modern [[Italian language]]; his greatest work, the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', is considered among the foremost literary statements produced in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]; furthermore, the poet invented the difficult ''[[terza rima]]''. The two great writers of the 14th century, Petrarch and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], sought out and imitated the works of antiquity and cultivated their own artistic personalities. Petrarch achieved fame through his collection of poems, ''[[Il Canzoniere]]''. Petrarch's love poetry served as a model for centuries. Equally influential was Boccaccio's ''[[The Decameron]]'', one of the most popular collections of short stories ever written.<ref name=Britannica-Shakespeare>{{cite encyclopedia| title = Giovanni Boccaccio: The Decameron.| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]| location = | date = | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70836/Giovanni-Boccaccio/755/The-Decameron| accessdate = 18 December 2013| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131219020413/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/70836/Giovanni-Boccaccio/755/The-Decameron| archivedate = 19 December 2013| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Portrait of Niccolò Machiavelli by Santi di Tito.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.8|[[Niccolò Machiavelli]], founder of the modern political science and ethics]]

Italian Renaissance authors produced a number of important works. [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' is one of the world's most famous essays on political science and modern philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. Another important work of the period, [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', continuation of [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]]'s unfinished romance ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'', is perhaps the greatest chivalry poem ever written. [[Baldassare Castiglione]]'s dialogue ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' describes the ideal of the perfect court gentleman and of spiritual beauty. The lyric poet [[Torquato Tasso]] in ''[[Jerusalem Delivered]]'' wrote a Christian epic, making use of the ''[[ottava rima]]'', with attention to the Aristotelian canons of unity.

[[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] and [[Giambattista Basile]], which have written ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' (1550–1555) and the ''[[Pentamerone]]'' (1634) respectively, printed some of the first known versions of fairy tales in Europe.<ref>Steven Swann Jones, ''The Fairy Tale: The Magic Mirror of Imagination'', Twayne Publishers, New York, 1995, {{ISBN|0-8057-0950-9}}, p. 38</ref><ref>Bottigheimer 2012a, 7; Waters 1894, xii; Zipes 2015, 599.</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Opie |first=Iona |authorlink2=Peter Opie| first2 =Peter|last2 = Opie |authorlink=Iona Opie |title=The Classic Fairy Tales |location=Oxford and New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-19-211559-1}} See p. 20.

At the end of the 17th century, the [[Academy of Arcadia|Arcadians]] began a movement to restore simplicity and classical restraint to poetry, as in [[Metastasio]]'s heroic melodramas. In the 18th century, playwright [[Carlo Goldoni]] created full written plays, many portraying the middle class of his day.

The Romanticism coincided with some ideas of the ''[[Risorgimento]]'', the patriotic movement that brought Italy political unity and freedom from foreign domination. Italian writers embraced Romanticism in the early 19th century. The time of Italy's rebirth was heralded by the poets [[Vittorio Alfieri]], [[Ugo Foscolo]], and [[Giacomo Leopardi]]. The works by [[Alessandro Manzoni]], the leading Italian Romantic, are a symbol of the Italian unification for their patriotic message and because of his efforts in the development of the modern, unified Italian language; his novel ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' was the first Italian historical novel to glorify Christian values of justice and Providence, and it has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.<ref name="Archibald Colquhoun 1954">Archibald Colquhoun.

Italian theatre can be traced back to the Roman tradition. The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Theatre and Drama in the Making|last=Gassner|first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books|year=1992|location=New York}}</ref>

During the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]]. The main categories of these characters include servants, old men, lovers, and captains.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Routledge Companion to Commedia Dell'Arte|author1=Chaffee, Judith |author2=Crick, Olly|publisher=Rutledge Taylor and Francis Group|year=2015|isbn=978-0-415-74506-2|location=London and New York|page=1|quote=|via=}}</ref>

[[Carlo Goldoni]], who wrote a few scenarios starting in 1734, supersed the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners through the characters and their behaviours. He rightly maintained that Italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before.

The [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples is the oldest continuously active venue for public opera in the world, opening in 1737, decades before both the Milan's [[La Scala]] and Venice's [[La Fenice]] theatres.<ref name=SanCarlo>{{cite web|url=http://www.teatrosancarlo.it/teatro/il?_locale|title=The Theatre and its history|publisher=Teatro di San Carlo's official website|date=23 December 2013}}</ref>

From [[Italian folk music|folk music]] to [[European classical music|classical]], music has always played an important role in Italian culture. Instruments associated with classical music, including the piano and violin, were invented in Italy,<ref>{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=Oxford University Press, US; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=978-0-19-816171-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Edward Heron|title=Violin-making, as it was and is: Being a Historical, Theoretical, and Practical Treatise on the Science and Art of Violin-making, for the Use of Violin Makers and Players, Amateur and Professional.

Modern Italian composers such as [[Luciano Berio|Berio]] and [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Nono]] proved significant in the development of [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[electronic music]].

Italy was also an important country in the development of [[disco]] and [[electronic music]], with [[Italo disco]], known for its futuristic sound and prominent use of synthesisers and [[drum machine]]s, being one of the earliest electronic dance genres, as well as European forms of disco aside from [[Euro disco]] (which later went on to influence several genres such as [[Eurodance]] and [[Nu-disco]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Scene and heard: Italo-disco|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/sep/01/sceneandhearditalodisco|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=14 July 2012|location=London|first=John|last=McDonnell|date=1 September 2008}}</ref> By circa 1988, the genre had merged into other forms of European dance and electronic music, such as [[Italo house]], which blended elements of Italo disco with traditional house music; its sound was generally uplifting, and made strong usage of piano melodies. Some bands of this genre are [[Black Box (band)|Black Box]], [[East Side Beat]], and [[49ers (band)|49ers]]. By the latter half of the 1990s, a subgenre of Eurodance known as [[Italo dance]] emerged. Taking influences from Italo disco and Italo house, Italo dance generally included synthesizer riffs, a melodic sound, and the usage of vocoders. Notable Italian DJs and remixers include [[Gabry Ponte]] (member of the group [[Eiffel 65]]), [[Benny Benassi]], [[Gigi D'Agostino]], and the trio [[Tacabro]].

Producers such as [[Giorgio Moroder]], who won three [[Academy Award]]s and four [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globes]] for his music, were highly influential in the development of [[electronic dance music]].<ref name=Moroder/> Today, Italian pop music is represented annually with the [[Sanremo Music Festival]], which served as inspiration for the [[Eurovision]] song contest, and the [[Festival of Two Worlds]] in [[Spoleto]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/7817 | publisher = www.esctoday.com | accessdate =18 August 2011 | title = Sanremo Music Festival kicks off tonight | date = 27 February 2007 | author = Yiorgos Kasapoglou}}</ref> Singers such as [[Mina (singer)|Mina]], [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Grammy]] winner [[Laura Pausini]], [[Zucchero Fornaciari|Zucchero]], [[Eros Ramazzotti]] and [[Tiziano Ferro]] have attained international acclaim.

=== Cinema ===
{{Main|Cinema of Italy}}
The history of Italian cinema began a few months after the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] began motion picture exhibitions. The first Italian film was a few seconds, showing [[Pope Leo XIII]] giving a blessing to the camera. The Italian film industry was born between 1903 and 1908 with three companies: the Società Italiana Cines, the [[Ambrosio Film]] and the Itala Film. Other companies soon followed in Milan and in Naples. In a short time these first companies reached a fair producing quality, and films were soon sold outside Italy. Cinema was later used by [[Benito Mussolini]], who founded Rome's renowned [[Cinecittà]] studio for the production of Fascist propaganda until World War II.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |title=The Cinema Under Mussolini |publisher=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu |accessdate=30 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731200507/http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/italians/resources/Amiciprize/1996/mussolini.html |archivedate=31 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[File:Cinecittà - Entrance.jpg|thumb|Entrance to [[Cinecittà]] in Rome, the largest film studio in Europe]]

As the country grew wealthier in the 1950s, a form of neorealism known as pink neorealism succeeded, and other [[film genre]]s, such as [[sword-and-sandal]] followed as [[spaghetti western]]s, were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. Actresses such as [[Sophia Loren]], [[Giulietta Masina]] and [[Gina Lollobrigida]] achieved international stardom during this period. Erotic Italian thrillers, or ''[[giallo]]s'', produced by directors such as [[Mario Bava]] and [[Dario Argento]] in the 1970s, also influenced the horror genre worldwide. In recent years, the Italian scene has received only occasional international attention, with movies like ''[[Life Is Beautiful]]'' directed by [[Roberto Benigni]], ''[[Il Postino: The Postman]]'' with [[Massimo Troisi]] and ''[[The Great Beauty]]'' directed by [[Paolo Sorrentino]].

The aforementioned [[Cinecittà]] studio is today the largest film and television production facility in continental Europe and the centre of the Italian cinema, where a large number of biggest box office hits are filmed, and one of the biggest production communities in the world. In the 1950s, the number of international productions being made there led to Rome's being dubbed "''[[Hollywood on the Tiber]]''". More than 3,000 productions have been made on its lot, of which 90 received an [[Academy Award]] nomination and 47 of these won it, from some cinema classics to recent rewarded features (such as ''[[Roman Holiday]]'', ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1968 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'', ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', and ''[[Gangs of New York]]'').<ref>{{Cite book|title = Italian Cinema: From Neorealism to the Present|url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Italian_cinema.html?id=PiTBFMc7tp4C|publisher = Continuum|date = 2001|isbn = 978-0-8264-1247-8|language = en|first = Peter E.|last = Bondanella|page = 13}}</ref>

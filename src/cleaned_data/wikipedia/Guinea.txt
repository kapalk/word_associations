{{Main|History of Guinea}}
The land that is now Guinea belonged to a series of African empires until France colonized it in the 1890s, and made it part of [[French West Africa]]. Guinea declared its independence from France on 2 October 1958. From independence until the [[Guinean presidential election, 2010|presidential election]] of 2010, Guinea was governed by a number of [[Autocracy|autocratic]] rulers.<ref>

For the origin of the name "Guinea" see {{section link|Guinea (region)|Etymology}}.

===West African empires and Kingdoms in Guinea===
{{main|Imamate of Futa Jallon|Wassoulou Empire}}
What is now Guinea was on the fringes of the major [[West Africa]]n empires. The earliest, the [[Ghana Empire]], grew on trade but ultimately fell after repeated incursions of the [[Almoravids]]. It was in this period that Islam first arrived in the region by way of North African traders.

The [[Sosso]] kingdom (12th to 13th centuries) briefly flourished in the resulting void but the [[Mali Empire]] came to prominence when [[Sundiata Keita|Soundiata Kéïta]] defeated the Sosso ruler [[Soumaoro Kanté|Soumangourou Kanté]] at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. The Mali Empire was ruled by [[Mansa (title)|Mansa]] (Emperors), the most famous being [[Musa I of Mali|Kankou Moussa]], who made a famous [[hajj]] to Mecca in 1324. Shortly after his reign the Mali Empire began to decline and was ultimately supplanted by its [[vassal]] states in the 15th century.

The most successful of these was the [[Songhai Empire]], which expanded its power from about 1460 and eventually surpassed the Mali Empire in both territory and wealth. It continued to prosper until a civil war over succession followed the death of [[Askia Daoud]] in 1582. The weakened empire fell to invaders from [[Morocco]] at the [[Battle of Tondibi]] just three years later. The Moroccans proved unable to rule the kingdom effectively, however, and it split into many small kingdoms.
[[File:Almamy Samory Touré.jpg|thumb|[[Samori Toure]] was the founder of the [[Wassoulou Empire]], an [[Islamic]] state in present-day Guinea that resisted [[France|French]] colonial rule in [[West Africa]] from 1882 until Touré's capture in 1898.]]
After the fall of the major West African empires, various kingdoms existed in what is now Guinea. [[Fulani]] Muslims migrated to [[Futa Jallon]] in Central Guinea and established an Islamic state from 1735 to 1898 with a written constitution and alternate rulers. The [[Wassoulou Empire|Wassoulou or Wassulu empire]] was a short-lived (1878–1898) empire, led by [[Samori Toure]] in the predominantly [[Mandinka people|Malinké]] area of what is now upper Guinea and southwestern [[Mali]] (Wassoulou). It moved to [[Ivory Coast]] before being conquered by the French.

===Colonial era===
The [[slave trade]] came to the coastal region of Guinea with European traders in the 16th century. Slaves were exported to work elsewhere in the [[triangular trade]].

Guinea's colonial period began with French military penetration into the area in the mid-19th century. French domination was assured by the defeat in 1898 of the armies of [[Samori Touré]], Mansa (or Emperor) of the [[Ouassoulou]] state and leader of Malinké descent, which gave France control of what today is Guinea and adjacent areas.

France negotiated Guinea's present boundaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the British for [[Sierra Leone]], the Portuguese for their Guinea colony (now [[Guinea-Bissau]]), and [[Liberia]]. Under the French, the country formed the [[French Guinea|Territory of Guinea]] within [[French West Africa]], administered by a governor general resident in [[Dakar]]. Lieutenant governors administered the individual colonies, including Guinea.

===Independence and post-colonial rule (1958–2008)===
In 1958, the [[French Fourth Republic]] collapsed due to political instability and its failures in dealing with its colonies, especially [[Indochina]] and [[Algeria]]. The founding of a [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] was supported by the French people, while French President [[Charles de Gaulle]] made it clear on 8 August 1958 that France's colonies were to be given a stark choice between more [[Autonomous entity|autonomy]] in a new [[French Community]] or immediate independence in the referendum to be held on 28 September 1958. The other colonies chose the former but Guinea—under the leadership of [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] whose [[Democratic Party of Guinea–African Democratic Rally|Democratic Party of Guinea]] (PDG) had won 56 of 60 seats in 1957 territorial elections — voted overwhelmingly for independence. The French withdrew quickly, and on 2 October 1958, Guinea proclaimed itself a sovereign and independent republic, with Sékou Touré as president.
[[File:Ahmed Sékou Touré na obisku v Ljubljani 1961 (3).jpg|thumb|President [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] was supported by the Communist bloc states and in 1961 visited [[Yugoslavia]].]]

France's withdrawal resulted in punitive economic reprisals, including the end of all French aid and investment. Guinea subsequently quickly aligned itself with the [[Soviet Union]] and adopted [[Socialism|socialist]] policies. This alliance was short-lived, however, as Guinea moved towards a Chinese model of socialism. Despite this, however, the country continued to receive aid and investment from [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries such as the [[United States]].

By 1960, Touré had declared the PDG the country's only legal political party and for the next 24 years, the government and the PDG were one.  Touré was reelected unopposed to four seven-year terms as president, and every five years voters were presented with a single list of PDG candidates for the National Assembly. Advocating a hybrid [[African Socialism]] domestically and [[Pan-Africanism]] abroad, Touré quickly became a polarising leader, and his government became intolerant of dissent, imprisoning thousands and stifling the press.

Throughout the 1960s the Guinean government nationalised land, removed French-appointed and traditional chiefs from power, and had strained ties with the French government and French companies. Touré's government relied on the Soviet Union and China for infrastructure aid and development but much of this was used for political and not economic purposes (such as the building of large stadiums to hold political rallies). Meanwhile, the country's roads, railways and other infrastructure languished and the economy stagnated.

[[File:22novemberdetail.JPG|thumb|Monument to commemorate the 1970 military victory over the Portuguese raid. The only objective not accomplished by the Portuguese raid was the capture of Ahmed Sékou Touré.]]

On 22 November 1970, Portuguese forces from neighboring [[Portuguese Guinea]] staged [[Operation Green Sea]], a raid on Conakry by several hundred exiled Guinean opposition forces. Among their goals, the Portuguese military wanted to kill or capture Sekou Toure due his support of the [[PAIGC]], an independence movement and rebel group that carried out attacks inside Portuguese Guinea from their bases in Guinea.<ref>"Mr Sekou Touré, who gave the PAIGC unstinted support during its war against the Portuguese,..."[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13213487 Black revolt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308154755/http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=13213487 |date=8 March 2009 }}, [[The Economist]] (22 November 1980)</ref> After fierce fighting, the Portuguese-backed forces retreated, having freed several dozen Portuguese prisoners of war that were being held by the PAIGC in Conakry but without having ousted Touré. In the years after the raid, massive purges were carried out by the Touré government and at least 50,000 people (1% of Guinea's entire population) were killed. Countless others were imprisoned, faced torture, or, often in the case of foreigners, were forced to leave the country (sometimes after having had their Guinean spouse arrested and their children placed into state custody).

A declining economy, mass killings, a stifling political atmosphere, and a ban on all private economic transactions led in 1977 to the "[[Guinean Market Women's Revolt|Market Women's Revolt]]," anti-government riots that were started by women working in Conakry's [[Marché Madina (Conakry)|Madina Market]]. This caused Touré to make major reforms. Touré vacillated from supporting the [[Soviet Union]] to supporting the United States. The late 1970s and early 1980s saw some economic reforms but Touré's centralized control of the state remained. Even the relationship with France improved; after the election of [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] as French president, trade increased and the two countries exchanged diplomatic visits.

Sékou Touré died on 26 March 1984 after a heart operation in the United States, and was replaced by [[Heads of Government of Guinea|Prime Minister]] [[Louis Lansana Beavogui]], who was to serve as interim president pending new elections. The PDG was due to elect a new leader on 3 April 1984. Under the constitution, that person would have been the only candidate for president. However, hours before that meeting, Colonels [[Lansana Conté]] and [[Diarra Traoré]] seized power in a bloodless [[coup]]. Conté assumed the role of president, with Traoré serving as prime minister until December.

Conté immediately denounced the previous regime's record on [[human rights]], released 250 political prisoners and encouraged approximately 200,000 more to return from exile. He also made explicit the turn away from socialism. This did little to alleviate poverty and the country showed no immediate signs of moving towards [[democracy]].

In 1992, Conté announced a return to civilian rule, with a presidential poll in 1993 followed by elections to parliament in 1995 (in which his party—the [[Party of Unity and Progress]]—won 71 of 114 seats.) Despite his stated commitment to democracy, Conté's grip on power remained tight. In September 2001, the opposition leader [[Alpha Condé]] was imprisoned for endangering state security, though he was pardoned 8 months later. He subsequently spent a period of exile in France.

In 2001, Conté organized and won a referendum to lengthen the presidential term and in 2003 begun his third term after elections were boycotted by the opposition. In January 2005, Conté survived a suspected assassination attempt while making a rare public appearance in the capital [[Conakry]]. His opponents claimed that he was a "tired dictator"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |title=Welcome Guinea Forum: Cornered, General Lansana Conte can only hope |website=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616165043/http://www.guinea-forum.org/Analyses/index.asp?ana=28&Lang=A |archivedate=16 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> whose departure was inevitable, whereas his supporters believed that he was winning a battle with dissidents.

===Executive branch===
The [[president of Guinea]] is normally elected by popular vote for a five-year term; the winning candidate must receive a majority of the votes cast to be elected president. The president governs Guinea, assisted by a [[Privy Council|council]] of 25 civilian [[Minister (government)|ministers]] appointed by him. The government administers the country through eight regions, 33 [[prefecture]]s, over 100 [[subprefecture]]s, and many districts (known as [[commune (subnational entity)|commune]]s in [[Conakry]] and other large cities and villages or "quartiers" in the interior). District-level leaders are elected; the president appoints officials to all other levels of the highly centralized administration.

Since the 2010 presidential elections, the head of state has been [[Alpha Condé]].

===Legislative branch===
The [[National Assembly of Guinea]], the country's legislative body, did not meet from 2008 to 2013 when it was dissolved after the military coup in December. [[Guinean legislative election, 2013|Elections]] have been postponed many times since 2007. In April 2012, President Condé postponed the elections indefinitely, citing the need to ensure that they were "transparent and democratic".<ref name="RNW Africa Desk">{{cite web|title=Guinea president postpones parliamentary elections indefinitely|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/guinea-president-postpones-parliamentary-elections-indefinitely|publisher=Radio Netherlands Worldwide|accessdate=22 August 2012|author=RNW Africa Desk|date=28 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430121146/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/guinea-president-postpones-parliamentary-elections-indefinitely|archivedate=30 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Guinea's foreign relations, including those with its [[West Africa]]n neighbors, have improved steadily since 1985.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2824.htm Background Note: Guinea] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623233834/https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2824.htm |date=23 June 2017 }}, US Department of State, February 2009</ref>

===Military===
{{Main|Military of Guinea}}
Guinea's armed forces are divided into five branches – army, navy, air force, the paramilitary National [[Gendarmerie]] and the Republican Guard – whose chiefs report to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is subordinate to the Minister of Defense. In addition, regime security forces include the National Police Force (Sûreté National). The Gendarmerie, responsible for internal security, has a strength of several thousand.

The army, with about 15,000 personnel, is by far the largest branch of the armed forces.  It is mainly responsible for protecting the state borders, the security of administered territories, and defending Guinea's national interests. Air force personnel total about 700. The force's equipment includes several Russian-supplied fighter planes and transports. The navy has about 900 personnel and operates several small [[patrol craft]] and barges.

Guinea shares a border with [[Senegal]] on the north, [[Mali]] on the northeast, [[Ivory Coast]] to the east, and [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] to the south. The nation forms a crescent as it curves from its southeast region to the north and west, to its northwest border with [[Guinea-Bissau]] and southwestern coast on the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The sources of the [[Niger River]], [[Gambia River]], and [[Senegal River]] are all found in the [[Guinea Highlands]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0h.htm |title=The Senegal River basin |website=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019075901/http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0h.htm |archive-date=19 October 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0i.htm |title=The Niger River basin |website=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170721033139/http://www.fao.org/docrep/w4347e/w4347e0i.htm |archive-date=21 July 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0t.htm |title=The West Coast |website=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011063822/http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4347E/w4347e0t.htm |archive-date=11 October 2012 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

At {{convert|245857|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, Guinea is roughly the size of the [[United Kingdom]]. There are {{convert|320|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coastline and a total land border of {{convert|3400|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It lies mostly between latitudes [[7th parallel north|7°]] and [[13th parallel north|13°N]], and longitudes [[7th meridian west|7°]] and [[15th meridian west|15°W]] (a small area is west of 15°).

Guinea is divided into four main regions: [[Maritime Guinea]], also known as Lower Guinea or the Basse-Coté lowlands, populated mainly by the [[Susu people|Susu]] ethnic group; the cooler, mountainous [[Fouta Djallon]] that run roughly north-south through the middle of the country, populated by Fulas, the Sahelian Haute-Guinea to the northeast, populated by [[Mandinka people|Malinké]], and the forested jungle regions in the southeast, with several ethnic groups. Guinea's mountains are the source for the Niger, the Gambia, and Senegal Rivers, as well as the numerous rivers flowing to the sea on the west side of the range in Sierra Leone and Ivory Coast.

The highest point in Guinea is [[Mount Nimba]] at {{convert|1752|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Although the Guinean and Ivorian sides of the [[Nimba Massif]] are a [[UNESCO]] [[Strict Nature Reserve]], the portion of the so-called Guinean Backbone continues into [[Liberia]], where it has been mined for decades; the damage is quite evident in the [[Nzérékoré Region]] at {{Coord|7|32|17|N|8|29|50|W|region:GN_type:landmark}}.

===Regions and prefectures===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Guinea}}
[[File:Guinea Regions.png|thumb|upright=1.6|[[Regions of Guinea]]]]

The Republic of Guinea covers {{convert|245857|km2|sqmi|0}} of West Africa, about [[10th parallel north|10 degrees north]] of the equator. Guinea is divided into four natural regions with distinct human, geographic, and climatic characteristics:

* [[Maritime Guinea]] (''La Guinée Maritime'') covers 18% of the country.
* [[Middle Guinea]] (''La Moyenne-Guinée'') covers 20% of the country.
* [[Upper Guinea]] (''La Haute-Guinée'') covers 38% of the country.
* [[Guinée forestière|Forested Guinea]] (''Guinée forestière'') covers 23% of the country, and is both forested and mountainous.

Guinea is divided into eight [[Regions of Guinea|administrative regions]] and subdivided into thirty-three [[Prefectures of Guinea|prefectures]]. [[Conakry]] is Guinea's capital, largest city, and economic centre. [[Nzérékoré]], located in the [[Guinée forestière]] region in Southern Guinea, is the second largest city.

Other major cities in the country with a population above 100,000 include [[Kankan]], [[Kindia]],  [[Labé|Labe]], [[Guéckédou]], [[Boké|Boke]], [[Mamou]] and [[Kissidougou]].

== Wildlife ==
{{Main|Wildlife of Guinea|Wildlife of Guinea=}}

The wildlife of Guinea is very diverse due to the wide variety of different habitats. The southern part of the country lies within [[Guinean Forests of West Africa]] [[Biodiversity hotspot|Biodiversity Hotspot]], while the north-east is characterized by dry savanna woodlands. Unfortunately, declining populations of large animals are restricted to uninhabited distant parts of parks and reserves.

=== Taxonomy ===
Species found in Guinea include the following:
* Amphibians : ''[[Hemisus guineensis]]'', ''[[Phrynobatrachus guineensis]]''
* Reptiles : ''[[Acanthodactylus]] guineensis'', ''[[Mochlus]] guineensis''
* Arachnids: ''[[Malloneta guineensis]]'', ''[[Dictyna]] guineensis''
* Insects : ''[[Zorotypus]] guineensis'', ''[[Euchromia guineensis]]''
* Birds: ''[[Melaniparus guineensis]]''

=== Natural resources ===
Guinea has abundant natural resources including 25% or more of the world's known [[bauxite]] reserves. Guinea also has diamonds, gold, and other metals. The country has great potential for [[hydroelectric power]]. Bauxite and [[Aluminium oxide|alumina]] are currently the only major exports. Other industries include processing plants for beer, juices, soft drinks and tobacco. Agriculture employs 80% of the nation's labor force. Under French rule, and at the beginning of independence, Guinea was a major exporter of bananas, [[pineapples]], coffee, peanuts, and [[palm oil]]. Guinea has considerable potential for growth in agricultural and fishing sectors. Soil, water, and climatic conditions provide opportunities for large-scale irrigated farming and agro industry.

===Mining===
{{main|Mining industry of Guinea}}

Guinea possesses over 25&nbsp;billion [[tonne]]s (metric tons) of [[bauxite]] – and perhaps up to one-half of the world's reserves. In addition, Guinea's mineral wealth includes more than 4-billion tonnes of high-grade [[iron ore]], significant diamond and gold deposits, and undetermined quantities of [[uranium]]. Possibilities for investment and commercial activities exist in all these areas, but Guinea's poorly developed [[infrastructure]] and rampant [[corruption]] continue to present obstacles to large-scale investment projects.

[[Joint venture]] [[bauxite]] mining and alumina operations in northwest Guinea historically provide about 80% of Guinea's [[Foreign exchange reserves|foreign exchange]]. Bauxite is refined into alumina, which is later [[smelting|smelted]] into aluminium.  The ''{{ILL|Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinea|fr}}'' (CBG), which exports about 14 million tonnes of high-grade bauxite annually, is the main player in the bauxite industry. CBG is a joint venture, 49% owned by the Guinean government and 51% by an international consortium known as [[Halco Mining]] Inc., itself a joint venture controlled by aluminium producer [[Alcoa]] (AA), global miner [[Rio Tinto Group]] and Dadco Investments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/metalsNews/idAFL5N0YK4R020150529|title=Guinea bauxite miner CBG plans $1 bln expansion to meet demand|website=Af.reuters.com|accessdate=2017-07-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010190042/https://af.reuters.com/article/metalsNews/idAFL5N0YK4R020150529|archive-date=10 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> CBG has exclusive rights to bauxite reserves and resources in north-western Guinea through 2038.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dadcoalumina.com/about/history.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718025131/http://www.dadcoalumina.com/about/history.aspx |archivedate=18 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2008 protesters upset about poor electrical services blocked the tracks CBG uses.

The ''Compagnie des Bauxites de Kindia'' (CBK), a joint venture between the government of Guinea and [[United Company RUSAL|RUSAL]], produces some 2.5&nbsp;million [[tonne]]s annually, nearly all of which is exported to [[Russia]] and Eastern Europe. [[Dian Dian]], a Guinean/[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] joint bauxite venture, has a projected production rate of {{convert|1000000|t|ST LT|0|abbr=on|lk=on}} per year, but is not expected to begin operation for several years. The ''[[Alumina Company of Guinea|Alumina Compagnie de Guinée]]'' (ACG), which took over the former Friguia Consortium, produced about 2.4&nbsp;million tonnes in 2004 as raw material for its alumina refinery. The refinery exports about 750,000 tonnes of alumina. Both Global Alumina and Alcoa-Alcan have signed conventions with the government of Guinea to build large alumina refineries with a combined capacity of about 4 million tonnes per year.

Diamonds and gold also are mined and exported on a large scale. The bulk of diamonds are mined [[artisanal mining|artisanally]]. The largest gold mining operation in Guinea is a joint venture between the government and [[Ashanti Goldfields]] of [[Ghana]]. AREDOR, a joint diamond-mining venture between the Guinean Government (50%) and an Australian, British, and Swiss [[consortium]], began production in 1984 and mined diamonds that were 90% gem quality. Production stopped from 1993 until 1996, when First City Mining of Canada purchased the international portion of the consortium. Société Minière de Dinguiraye (SMD) also has a large gold mining facility in Lero, near the Malian border.

===Oil===
Guinea signed a [[production sharing agreement]] with Hyperdynamics Corporation of [[Houston]] in 2006 to explore a large offshore tract, and was recently in partnership with [[Dana Petroleum]] PLC ([[Aberdeen]], United Kingdom). The initial well, the Sabu-1, was scheduled to begin drilling in October 2011 at a site in approximately 700&nbsp;meters of water.  The Sabu-1 targeted a four-way [[anticline]] prospect with [[upper Cretaceous]] sands and was anticipated to be drilled to a total depth of 3,600&nbsp;meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://investors.hyperdynamics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=600343 |title=Hyperdynamics Corporation - Jasper Explorer Drill Ship En Route to Hyperdynamics' First Exploration Drilling Site Offshore Guinea |website=Investors.hyperdynamics.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914023859/http://investors.hyperdynamics.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=600343 |archive-date=14 September 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
The majority of Guineans work in the agriculture sector, which employs approximately 75% of the country. The rice is cultivated in the flooded zones between streams and rivers. However,  the local production of rice is not sufficient to feed the country, so rice is imported from Asia. The [[agriculture in Guinea|agriculture sector of Guinea]] cultivates coffee beans, pineapples, peaches, nectarines, [[mango]]es, [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], bananas, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper, and many other types of produce. Guinea is one of the emerging regional producers of apples and pears. There are many plantations of grapes, pomegranates, and recent years have seen the development of strawberry plantations based on the vertical hydroponic system.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Le "Voile" de la mariée à Kindia.png|thumb|Le "Voile" de la mariée à Kindia]]
Due to its diverse geography, Guinea presents some interesting tourist sites. Among the top attractions are the waterfalls found mostly in the Basse Guinee (Lower Guinea) and Moyenne Guinee (Middle Guinea) regions. The Soumba cascade at the foot of Mount Kakoulima in Kindia, Voile de la Mariee (bride's veil) in Dubreka, Kinkon cascades of about 80 m high on the Kokoula river in the prefecture of Pita, the Kambadaga falls on the same river that can reach 100 m high during the raining season, the Ditinn & Mitty waterfalls in Dalaba, Fetoré waterfalls and the stone bridge in the region of Labe are among the well known water-related tourist sites.

==Problems and reforms==
In 2002, the [[IMF]] suspended Guinea's [[Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility]] (PRGF) because the government failed to meet key performance criteria. In reviews of the PRGF, the World Bank noted that Guinea had met its spending goals in targeted social priority sectors. However, spending in other areas, primarily defense, contributed to a significant fiscal deficit.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} The loss of IMF funds forced the government to finance its debts through [[Central Bank]] advances. The pursuit of unsound economic policies has resulted in imbalances that are proving hard to correct.

Under then-Prime Minister Diallo, the government began a rigorous reform agenda in December 2004 designed to return Guinea to a PRGF with the IMF. Exchange rates have been allowed to float, price controls on gasoline have been loosened, and government spending has been reduced while tax collection has been improved. These reforms have not reduced inflation, which hit 27% in 2004 and 30% in 2005. [[Currency depreciation]] is also a concern. The Guinea franc was trading at 2550 to the dollar in January 2005. It hit 5554 to the dollar by October 2006. In August 2016 that number had reached 9089.

Despite the opening in 2005 of a new road connecting Guinea and Mali, most major roadways remain in poor repair, slowing the delivery of goods to local markets. Electricity and water shortages are frequent and sustained, and many businesses are forced to use expensive power generators and fuel to stay open.

Even though there are many problems plaguing Guinea's economy, not all foreign investors are reluctant to come to Guinea. Global Alumina's proposed alumina refinery has a price tag above $2&nbsp;billion. Alcoa and Alcan are proposing a slightly smaller refinery worth about $1.5&nbsp;billion. Taken together, they represent the largest private investment in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] since the [[Chad-Cameroon Petroleum Development and Pipeline Project|Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline]]. Also, Hyperdynamics Corporation, an American oil company, signed an agreement in 2006 to develop Guinea's offshore [[Senegal River|Senegal Basin]] oil deposits in a concession of {{convert|31000|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}; it is pursuing seismic exploration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hyperdynamics.com/media/HDY-JV-Partner-Opportunity-Brochure-082208.pdf|title=Joint Venture Opportunity Offshore the West Coast of Africa|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207130218/http://www.hyperdynamics.com/media/HDY-JV-Partner-Opportunity-Brochure-082208.pdf|archivedate=7 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}Hyperdynamics Corporation (2008)</ref>

On 13 October 2009, Guinean Mines Minister Mahmoud Thiam announced that the [[China International Fund]] would invest more than $7bn (£4.5bn) in infrastructure. In return, he said the firm would be a "strategic partner" in all mining projects in the mineral-rich nation. He said the firm would help build ports, railway lines, power plants, low-cost housing and even a new administrative centre in the capital, [[Conakry]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Guinea confirms huge China deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8304418.stm|date=13 October 2009|accessdate=13 October 2009|publisher=BBC News|location=London|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20091015040614/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8304418.stm|archive-date=15 October 2009|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In September 2011, Mohamed Lamine Fofana, the Mines Minister following the [[Guinean presidential election, 2010|2010 election]], said that the government had overturned the agreement by the ex-military junta.<ref name="bbcmines">{{cite news|title=Guinea mining: PM defends radical industry shake-up|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14915121|newspaper=BBC|date=14 September 2011|access-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181027214243/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14915121|archive-date=27 October 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Youth unemployment remains a large problem. Guinea needs an adequate policy to address the concerns of urban youth. One problem is the disparity between their life and what they see on television. For youth who cannot find jobs, seeing the economic power and consumerism of richer countries only serves to frustrate them further.<ref>[http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/171240/index.en.shtml Joschka Philipps, "Explosive youth: Focus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526044412/http://www.inwent.org/ez/articles/171240/index.en.shtml |date=26 May 2010 }}, D+C (Development and Cooperation), funded by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development,(2010/05) pages 190–193].

===Mining controversies===
Guinea has large reserves of the steel-making raw material, iron ore. [[Rio Tinto Group]] was the majority owner of the $6 billion [[Simandou]] [[iron ore]] project, which it had called the world's best unexploited resource. This project is said to be of the same magnitude as the [[Pilbara]] in Western Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miningweekly.com/print-version/red-gold-in-africa-exploring-red-gold-red-gold-rising-2012-10-05|title=Mining Weekly – West Africa emerging as new Pilbara as miners race to develop iron-ore projects|website=Miningweekly.com|access-date=2017-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220092050/http://www.miningweekly.com/print-version/red-gold-in-africa-exploring-red-gold-red-gold-rising-2012-10-05|archive-date=20 February 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

and so did the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the next elected President of Guinea, [[Alpha Condé]], and an assortment of other national and international entities.

In April 2014 the Guinean government cancelled the company's mining rights in Simandou. BSGR has denied any wrongdoing, and in May 2014 sought arbitration over the government of Guinea's decision to expropriate its mining rights.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/guinea-mining-idUSL6N0NT61620140507|title=UPDATE 2-BSGR starts arbitration against Guinea over lost mining rights|date=2017-05-07|access-date=2017-02-19|newspaper=Reuters|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012031548/https://www.reuters.com/article/guinea-mining-idUSL6N0NT61620140507|archive-date=12 October 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Health==

===Ebola===
{{Further|Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa}}
In 2014, there was an outbreak of the [[Ebola virus epidemic in Guinea|Ebola virus in Guinea]]. In response, the health ministry banned [[Bushmeat|the sale and consumption of bats]], thought to be carriers of the disease. Despite this measure, the virus eventually spread from rural areas to [[Conakry]],<ref>{{cite news |date= 28 March 2014 |title= Ebola: Guinea outbreak reaches capital Conakry |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26774343 |publisher= BBC |accessdate= 30 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140330024741/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-26774343 |archive-date= 30 March 2014 |dead-url= no |df= dmy-all }}</ref> and by late June 2014 had spread to neighboring countries [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]]. In early August 2014 Guinea closed its borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia to help contain the spreading of the virus, as more new cases of the disease were being reported in those countries than in Guinea.

The outbreak began in early December, in a village called Meliandou, southeastern Guinea, not far from the borders with both Liberia and Sierra Leone. The first known case was a two-year-old child who died, after fever and vomiting and passing black stool, on December 6. The child's mother died a week later, then a sister and a grandmother, all with symptoms that included fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Then, by way of caregiving visits or attendance at funerals, the outbreak spread to other villages.

Unsafe burials remained one of the primary sources of the transmission of the disease. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the inability to engage with local communities hindered the ability of health workers to trace the origins and strains of the virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-4-march-2015|title=Ebola Situation Report – 4 March 2015 {{!}} Ebola|website=apps.who.int|language=en|access-date=2017-02-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301084553/http://apps.who.int/ebola/current-situation/ebola-situation-report-4-march-2015|archive-date=1 March 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The epidemic also affected the treatment of other diseases in Guinea. There was a decline in healthcare visits by the population due to fear of being infected and mistrust in the health care system, and a decrease in the system's ability to provide routine health care and HIV/AIDS treatments due to the Ebola outbreak.<ref>[http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(15)60713-9.pdf] {{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref>

HIV is spread primarily through multiple-partner [[heterosexual]] intercourse. Men and women are at nearly equal risk for HIV, with young people aged 15 to 24 most vulnerable. Surveillance figures from 2001–2002 show high rates among commercial sex workers (42%), active military personnel (6.6%), truck drivers and bush taxi drivers (7.3%), miners (4.7%), and adults with tuberculosis (8.6%).<ref name=usaid/>

Several factors are fueling the HIV/[[AIDS]] epidemic in Guinea. They include unprotected sex, multiple sexual partners, illiteracy, endemic poverty, unstable borders, refugee migration, lack of civic responsibility, and scarce medical care and public services.<ref name=usaid/>

===Malnutrition===
Malnutrition is a serious problem for Guinea. A 2012 study reported high chronic malnutrition rates, with levels ranging from 34% to 40% by region, as well as acute malnutrition rates above 10% in Upper Guinea's mining zones. The survey showed that 139,200 children suffer from acute malnutrition, 609,696 from chronic malnutrition and further 1,592,892 suffer from anemia. Degradation of care practices, limited access to medical services, inadequate hygiene practices and a lack of food diversity explain these levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/eb/wfpdoc062106.pdf |title=Enquête nationale nutrition-santé, basée sur la méthodologie SMART, 2011–2012 |accessdate=12 May 2014 |year=2012 |format=PDF |publisher=World Food Programme }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

It is bordered by [[Sudan]] in the west, [[Ethiopia]] in the south, and [[Djibouti]] in the southeast. The northeastern and eastern parts of Eritrea have an extensive coastline along the [[Red Sea]]. The nation has a total area of approximately {{Convert|117600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, and includes the [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and several of the [[Hanish Islands]]. Its [[toponym]] ''Eritrea'' is based on the [[Greek language|Greek]] name for the Red Sea ({{lang|grc|Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα }} {{lang|grc-Latn|Erythra Thalassa}}), which was first adopted for [[Italian Eritrea]] in 1890.

Eritrea is a multi-ethnic country, with nine recognized ethnic groups in its population of around {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Eritrea}}|R}}/1e6 round 0}} million. Most residents speak languages from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family, either of the [[Ethiopian Semitic languages]] or [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branches. Among these communities, the [[Tigrayans|Tigrinyas]] make up about 55% of the population, with the [[Tigre people]] constituting around 30% of inhabitants. In addition, there are a number of [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking [[Nilotic]] ethnic minorities. Most people in the territory adhere to [[Christianity]] or [[Islam]].<ref name="CIA">{{CIA World Factbook link|er|Eritrea|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>

The creation of modern-day Eritrea is a result of the incorporation of independent, distinct kingdoms and sultanates (for example, [[Medri Bahri]] and the [[Sultanate of Aussa]]) eventually resulting in the formation of [[Italian Eritrea]]. After the defeat of the Italian colonial army in 1942, Eritrea was administered by the [[British Military Administration (Eritrea)|British Military Administration]] until 1952. Following the UN General Assembly decision, in 1952, Eritrea would govern itself with a local Eritrean parliament but for foreign affairs and defense it would enter into a federal status with Ethiopia for a period of 10 years. However, in 1962 the government of Ethiopia annulled the Eritrean parliament and formally annexed Eritrea. But the Eritreans that argued for complete Eritrean independence since the ouster of the Italians in 1941, anticipated what was coming and in 1960 organized the Eritrean Liberation Front in opposition. In 1991, after 30 years of continuous armed struggle for independence, the Eritrean liberation fighters entered the capital city, Asmara, in victory.

==Name==
The name ''Eritrea'' is derived from the ancient Greek name for the [[Red Sea]] ({{lang|grc|[[Erythraean Sea|Ἐρυθρὰ Θάλασσα]]}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Erythra Thalassa}}, based on the adjective {{lang|grc| ἐρυθρός }} {{lang|grc-Latn|erythros}} "red").

At Buya in Eritrea, one of the oldest [[hominid]]s representing a possible link between ''[[Homo erectus]]'' and an archaic ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]'' was found by Italian scientists.

This is confirmed by genetic studies of mummified [[baboon]]s. In 2010, a study was conducted on baboon mummies that were brought from Punt to Egypt as gifts by the ancient Egyptians. The scientists from the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[University of California]] used oxygen [[isotope]] analysis to examine hairs from two baboon mummies that had been preserved in the [[British Museum]]. One of the baboons had distorted isotopic data, so the other's oxygen isotope values were compared to those of present-day baboon specimens from regions of interest. The researchers initially found that the mummies most closely matched modern baboon specimens in Eritrea and Ethiopia, which suggested that Punt was likely a narrow region that included eastern Ethiopia and all of Eritrea.<ref name="independent.co.uk">{{cite news|title= Baboon mummy analysis reveals Eritrea and Ethiopia as location of land of Punt |accessdate= 26 April 2010 |work= The Independent|date= 26 April 2010 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history/baboon-mummy-analysis-reveals-eritrea-and-ethiopia-as-location-of-land-of-punt-1954547.html|author=Jarus, Owen}}</ref> In 2015, isotopic analysis of other ancient baboon mummies from Punt confirmed that the specimens likely originated from an area encompassing the Eritrea-Ethiopia corridor and eastern Somalia.<ref>{{cite web|last1=NATHANIEL J.

Excavations at [[Sembel]] found evidence of an ancient pre-[[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite]] civilization in greater Asmara. This Ona urban culture is believed to have been among the earliest pastoral and agricultural communities in the Horn region.

Additionally, the Ona culture may have had connections with the ancient Land of Punt. In a tomb in [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] ([[Luxor]]) dated to the 18th dynasty reign of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep II|Amenophis II]] (Amenhotep II), long-necked pots similar to those that were made by the Ona people are depicted as part of the cargo in a ship from Punt.<ref name="Avanzini">{{cite book|last1=Avanzini|first1=Alessandra|title=Profumi d'Arabia: atti del convegno|date=1997|publisher=L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER|isbn=978-8870629750|page=280|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=3zOlYZmJiiAC}}</ref>

====Kingdom of D'mt====
{{main|Dʿmt}}
[[File:Leaping Ibex, Ethiopia (2130266960).jpg|thumb|Bronze oil lamp excavated at [[Matara, Eritrea|Matara]], dating from the [[Dʿmt|Kingdom of Dʿmt]] (1st century BCE or earlier)]]
[[Dʿmt]] was a kingdom that encompassed most of Eritrea and the northern frontier of Ethiopia. The polity existed during the 10th to 5th centuries BC. Given the presence of a massive temple complex at [[Yeha]], this area was most likely the kingdom's capital. [[Qohaito]], often identified as the town of Koloe in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'',<ref>Huntingford, G.W.B. (1989) ''Historical Geography of Ethiopia from the first century AD to 1704''. London: British Academy. pp. 38 ff</ref> as well as [[Matara, Eritrea|Matara]] were important ancient Dʿmt kingdom cities in southern Eritrea.

The realm developed [[irrigation]] schemes, used [[plow]]s, grew [[millet]], and made [[iron]] tools and weapons. After the fall of Dʿmt in the 5th century BC, the plateau came to be dominated by smaller successor kingdoms. This lasted until the rise of one of these polities during the first century, the [[Kingdom of Aksum]], which was able to reunite the area.<ref>Pankhurst, Richard K.P.

====Kingdom of Aksum====
{{main|Kingdom of Aksum}}
The Kingdom of Aksum was a trading empire centered in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia.<ref>{{cite book|date= 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=48|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=xeJMAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA48|title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology|author=Phillipson, David |editor=Neil Asher Silberman}}</ref> It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite [[Iron Age]] period around the 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD.

According to the medieval ''Liber Axumae'' ([[Book of Aksum]]), Aksum's first capital, Mazaber, was built by Itiyopis, son of Cush.<ref name="Agrvt">{{cite book|title=Africa Geoscience Review, Volume 10|date=2003|publisher=Rock View International|page=366|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=QWBPAQAAIAAJ}}</ref> The capital was later moved to [[Axum|Aksum]] in northern Ethiopia. The Kingdom used the name "Ethiopia" as early as the 4th century.<ref name="Munro-Hay57"/><ref name="Paul B. Henze 2005"/>

The Aksumites erected a number of large [[Stele|stelae]], which served a religious purpose in pre-[[Christianity|Christian]] times. One of these granite columns, the [[Obelisk of Aksum]], is the largest such structure in the world, standing at {{convert|90|ft|m|abbr=off}}.<ref name="Eospvo">{{cite book|last=Brockman|first=Norbert|title=Encyclopedia of Sacred Places, Volume 1|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598846546|page=30|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=JkSk4euA-TEC}}</ref> Under [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 320–360), Aksum later adopted [[Christianity]].<ref name="Munro-Hay">{{cite book|last1=Munro-Hay|first1=Stuart C.|title=Aksum: An African Civilisation of Late Antiquity|date=1991|publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]]|isbn=978-0748601066|page=77|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=RlRzAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>

In the 7th century, early [[Muslim]]s from [[Mecca]], at least [[Sahaba|companions]] of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic ''Nabī'']] ({{lang-ar|نَـبِي}}, [[Prophet]]) [[Muhammad]], sought refuge from [[Quraysh]]i [[persecution of Muslims by the Meccans|persecution]] by travelling to the kingdom, a journey known in [[Islamic history]] as the [[Migration to Abyssinia|First Hijrah]]. They reportedly built the [[List of the oldest mosques#Africa|first]] African [[mosque]], that is the [[Mosque of the Companions, Massawa]].<ref name="Reid2012Massawa">{{cite book |last=Reid |first=Richard J. |title=A History of Modern Africa: 1800 to the Present |publisher=[[John Wiley and Sons]] |chapter=The Islamic Frontier in Eastern Africa |page=106 |isbn=978-0470658987 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=US6RQtYwasUC |date=12 January 2012 |access-date=15 March 2015}}</ref>

The kingdom is mentioned in the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' as an important market place for [[Ivory trade|ivory]], which was exported throughout the ancient world. Aksum was at the time ruled by [[Zoskales]], who also governed the port of [[Adulis]].<ref name="Periplusme">[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/periplus.html ''Periplus of the Erythreaean Sea''], chs. 4, 5</ref> The Aksumite rulers facilitated trade by minting their own [[Aksumite currency]]. The state also established its [[hegemony]] over the declining [[Kingdom of Kush]] and regularly entered the politics of the kingdoms on the [[Arabian peninsula]], eventually extending its rule over the region with the conquest of the [[Himyarite Kingdom]].  The country is also the alleged resting place of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and the purported home of the [[Queen of Sheba]].<ref name="Raffaele2007">{{cite journal |first=Paul |last=Raffaele |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/ark-covenant-200712.html?c=y&page=1 |title=Keepers of the Lost Ark?|journal=Smithsonian Magazine |date=December 2007 |access-date= 5 April 2011}}</ref>

[[File:Eritrea-Semenawi Keyih Bahri.png|thumb|right|The [[Northern Red Sea Region]], part of the [[Hamasien]] province of the medieval [[Medri Bahri]] kingdom]]
After the decline of Aksum, the Eritrean highlands were under the domain of [[Bahr Negash]] ruled by the Bahr Negus. The area was then known as ''Ma'ikele Bahr'' ("between the seas/rivers", i.e. the land between the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Mareb River|Mereb river]]).<ref>Tamrat, Taddesse (1972) ''Church and State in Ethiopia (1270–1527)''.

Turks briefly occupied the highland parts of Baharnagash in 1559 and withdrew after they encountered resistance and were pushed back by the Bahrnegash and highland forces. In 1578 they tried to expand into the highlands with the help of Bahr Negash Yisehaq who had switched alliances due to power struggle, and by 1589 once again they were apparently compelled to withdraw their forces to the coast. After that Ottomans abandoned their ambitions to establish themselves on the highlands and remained in the lowlands until they left the region by 1872.<ref name="A10-4">Jonathan Miran [https://books.google.com/books?id=PMFVeWTWF0YC&pg=PA38&dq=%22resistance+and+pushed+back+by+the+bahr+negash+and+highland+forces%22+%22the+Turks+remained+relatively+briefly+in+the+highlands%22#v=onepage&q=%22resistance%20and%20pushed%20back%20by%20the%20bahr%20negash%20and%20highland%20forces%22%20%22the%20Turks%20remained%20relatively%20briefly%20in%20the%20highlands%22 Red Sea Citizens: Cosmopolitan Society and Cultural Change in Massawa].

The Scottish traveler [[James Bruce]] reported in 1770 that Medri Bahri was a distinct political entity from [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], noting that the two territories were frequently in conflict. The Bahre-Nagassi ("Kings of the Sea") alternately fought with or against the Abyssinians and the neighbouring Muslim [[Adal Sultanate]] depending on the geopolitical circumstances. Medri Bahri was thus part of the Christian resistance against Imam [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] of Adal's forces, but later joined the Adalite states and the [[Ottoman Empire]] front against Abyssinia in 1572. That 16th century also marked the arrival of the Ottomans, who began making inroads in the Red Sea area.<ref name="MB01">{{cite book|author=Okbazghi Yohannes|title=A Pawn in World Politics: Eritrea|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sG41eDVRDnoC&pg=PA31|year=1991|publisher=University of Florida Press|isbn=978-0-8130-1044-1|pages=31–32}}</ref>

James Bruce in his book published in 1805 reported Hadawi, the seat of Baharanagash, was part of the Tigré province of Abyssinia which was ruled by Ras [[Mikael Sehul]] at the time of his travel. The officer in Hadawi watched over the Naybe of Masawa (province of Turk's [[Habesh Eyalet]]), and starved him into obedience by intercepting his provisions, whenever the officer in Hadawi and the governor of Tigré found it necessary. Bruce also located Tigré between [[Red Sea]] and the river [[Tekezé River|Tekezé]] and stated many large governments, such as Enderta and Antalow, and the great part of Baharhagash were on the eastern side of Tigré province.<ref name="A10-1">James Bruce [https://books.google.com/books?id=vzVWAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA171&dq=Hadawi+%22seat+of+the+baharnagash%22+%22maintained+to+watch+over%22+%22and+to+starve+him+into+obedience+by+intercepting+his+provisions,+whenever+he+was+commanded+by+the+governor+of+Tigr%C3%A9%22+Naybe#v=onepage&q=Hadawi%20%22seat%20of%20the%20baharnagash%22%20%22maintained%20to%20watch%20over%22%20%22and%20to%20starve%20him%20into%20obedience%20by%20intercepting%20his%20provisions%2C%20whenever%20he%20was%20commanded%20by%20the%20governor%20of%20Tigr%C3%A9%22%20Naybe Travels through part of Africa, Syria, Egypt ...].

By 1517, the Ottomans had succeeded in conquering Medri Bahri. They occupied all of northeastern present-day Eritrea for the next two decades, an area which stretched from [[Massawa]] to [[Suakin|Swakin]] in Sudan.<ref name="MB01"/>

The territory became an Ottoman governorate ([[eyalet]]), known as the [[Habesh Eyalet]]. Massawa served as the new province's first capital. When the city became of secondary economical importance, the administrative capital was soon moved across the Red Sea to [[Jeddah]]. Its headquarters remained there from the end of the 16th century to the early 19th century, with Medina temporarily serving as the capital in the 18th century.<ref name=encaet>{{cite book|author=Siegbert Uhlig|title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=X38lxaUjm1MC&pg=PA951|year=2005|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-05238-2|page=951}}</ref>

In the vacuum that followed the [[Battle of Gallabat|1889 death]] of [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV|Yohannes&nbsp;IV]], Gen. [[Oreste Baratieri]] occupied the highlands along the Eritrean coast and Italy proclaimed the establishment of the new colony of [[Italian Eritrea]], a colony of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. In the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] (It.&nbsp;''Uccialli'') signed the same year, [[Menelik II|King Menelik]] of [[Shewa]], a southern Ethiopian kingdom, recognized the Italian occupation of his rivals' lands of [[Bogos]], [[Hamasien]], [[Akkele Guzay]], and [[Serae]] in exchange for guarantees of financial assistance and continuing access to European arms and ammunition. His subsequent victory over his rival kings and enthronement as [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelek&nbsp;II]] (r.&nbsp;1889–1913) made the treaty formally binding upon the entire territory.<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |volume=1 |page=94}}</ref>

Additionally, the Italian Eritrea administration opened a number of new factories, which produced buttons, cooking oil, pasta, construction materials, packing meat, tobacco, hide and other household commodities. In 1939, there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens. The establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities. The number of Italians residing in the territory increased from 4,600 to 75,000 in five years; and with the involvement of Eritreans in the industries, trade and fruit plantation was expanded across the nation, while some of the plantations were owned by Eritreans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shabait.com/about-eritrea/history-a-culture/450-italian-administration-in-eritrea|title=Italian administration in Eritrea|author=Woldeyesus, Winta |publisher=Eritrea Ministry of Information}}</ref>

In 1922, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s rise to power in Italy brought profound changes to the colonial government in Italian Eritrea. After ''[[il Duce]]'' declared the birth of the [[Italian Empire]] in May 1936, Italian Eritrea (enlarged with northern Ethiopia's regions) and [[Italian Somaliland]] were merged with the just conquered Ethiopia in the new [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'') administrative territory. This [[Fascists|Fascist]] period was characterized by imperial expansion in the name of a "new Roman Empire". Eritrea was chosen by the Italian government to be the industrial center of Italian East Africa.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102012/http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm ITALIAN INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES]. dankalia.com</ref>

Asmara's architecture after 1935 was greatly improved to become a "modernist Art Deco city" (in 2017 has been declared a "UNESCO World City Heritage"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1550|title=Asmara: A Modernist African City|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}</ref>), featuring ''eclectic and rationalist built forms, well-defined open spaces, and public and private buildings, including cinemas, shops, banks, religious structures, public and private offices, industrial facilities, and residences'' (according to UNESCO's publications). The Italians designed more than 400 buildings in a construction boom that was only halted by Italy's involvement in [[WW2]]. These included art deco masterpieces like the worldwide famous [[Fiat Tagliero Building]] and the [[Cinema Impero]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://dadfeatured.blogspot.com/2018/08/italian-asmara.html|title=Dadfeatured: ITALIAN ASMARA|last=Bjunior|date=6 August 2018|publisher=}}</ref>

The British placed Eritrea under British military administration until [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] could determine its fate.

In the absence of agreement amongst the Allies concerning the status of Eritrea, British administration continued for the remainder of World War II and until 1950. During the immediate postwar years, the British proposed that Eritrea be divided along religious lines and annexed to their Sudan and to Ethiopia.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The [[Soviet Union]], anticipating a [[communist]] victory in the Italian polls, initially supported returning Eritrea to Italy under trusteeship or as a colony.

====Federation with Ethiopia====
In the 1950s, the Ethiopian feudal administration under Emperor [[Haile Selassie of Ethiopia|Haile Selassie]] sought to annex Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. He laid claim to both territories in a letter to Franklin D. Roosevelt at the Paris Peace Conference and at the First Session of the United Nations.<ref name="un">{{cite book|last=Habte Selassie |first=Bereket |title=Eritrea and the United Nations |isbn= 978-0-932415-12-7 |publisher=Red Sea Press|year=1989}}</ref> In the United Nations, the debate over the fate of the former Italian colonies continued.

====Independence====
{{main|Eritrean War of Independence}}
[[File:Asmara, mai jah jah 02.JPG|thumb|Asmara, Eritrea in 2015]]
In 1958, a group of Eritreans founded the Eritrean Liberation Movement (ELM). The organization mainly consisted of Eritrean students, professionals and intellectuals. It engaged in clandestine political activities intended to cultivate resistance to the centralizing policies of the imperial Ethiopian state.<ref>Ofcansky, TP Berry, L (2004) Ethiopia, a country study, Kessinger Publishing, p. 69</ref> On 1 September 1961, the [[Eritrean Liberation Front]] (ELF), under the leadership of [[Hamid Idris Awate]], waged an armed struggle for independence. In 1962, Emperor [[Haile Selassie]] unilaterally dissolved the Eritrean parliament and annexed the territory. The ensuing [[Eritrean War for Independence]] went on for 30 years against successive Ethiopian governments until 1991, when the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF), a successor of the [[Eritrean Liberation Front|ELF]], defeated the Ethiopian forces in Eritrea and helped a coalition of [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front|Ethiopian rebel forces]] take control of the Ethiopian capital [[Addis Ababa]].

After the liberation Eritrea held a [[Eritrean independence referendum, 1993|referendum]] on independence between 23 and 25 April 1993 under international supervision including the UN Observer Mission to Verify the Referendum in Eritrea (UNOVER).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The result was 99.83% in favour, with a 98.5% turnout.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africanelections.tripod.com/er.html|title=Elections in Eritrea|date=23 January 2011|publisher=African Elections Database|accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref> The referendum was completed under budget, and was considered free and fair. Independence was declared on 27 April. The EPLF declared the new nation of Eritrea the following month. In February 1994 the EPLF renamed itself the People's Front for Democracy and Justice as part of its transformation into Eritrea's ruling political party.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-37675/Eritrea |title=Eritrea – The spreading revolution |website=Encyclopædia Britannica }}</ref>

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Eritrea}}

===Location and habitat===
[[File:Un-eritrea.png|thumb|right|Map of Eritrea]]
Eritrea is located in the [[Horn of Africa]] in [[East Africa]]. It is bordered to the northeast and east by the [[Red Sea]], [[Sudan]] to the west, [[Ethiopia]] to the south, and [[Djibouti]] to the southeast. Eritrea lies between latitudes [[12th parallel north|12°]] and [[18th parallel north|18°N]], and longitudes [[36th meridian east|36°]] and [[44th meridian east|44°E]].

The country is virtually bisected by a branch of the [[East African Rift]]. It has fertile lands to the west, descending to desert in the east. Eritrea, at the southern end of the Red Sea, is the home of the fork in the rift. The [[Dahlak Archipelago]] and its fishing grounds are situated off the sandy and arid coastline.
 [[File:Dahlak reliefmap.png|thumb|left|upright|The [[Dahlak Archipelago]]]]
Eritrea can be split into three [[ecoregion]]s. To the east of the highlands are the hot, arid coastal plains stretching down to the southeast of the country. The cooler, more fertile highlands, reaching up to 3000m has a different habitat. Habitats here vary from the [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|sub-tropical rainforest]] at Filfil Solomona to the precipitous cliffs and [[canyon]]s of the southern highlands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eritrea|publisher=fatbirder.com|url=http://www.fatbirder.com/links_geo/africa/eritrea.html}}</ref>
The [[Afar Triangle]] or Danakil Depression of Eritrea is the probable location of a [[triple junction]] where three tectonic plates are pulling away from one another. The highest point of the country, [[Emba Soira]], is located in the center of Eritrea, at {{convert|3018|m|ft|0|sp=us}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

The main cities of the country are the capital city of [[Asmara]] and the port town of [[Asseb]] in the southeast, as well as the towns of [[Massawa]] to the east, the northern town of [[Keren, Eritrea|Keren]], and the central town [[Mendefera]].

Eritrea is part of a 14 nation constituency within the [[Global Environment Facility]], which partners with international institutions, civil society organizations, and the private sector to address global environmental issues while supporting national sustainable development initiatives.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eritrea|url=http://beta.thegef.org/country/eritrea|publisher=Global Environment Facility|accessdate=18 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816065505/http://beta.thegef.org/country/eritrea|archivedate=16 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Local variability in rainfall patterns and/or reduced precipitation is known to occur, which may precipitate soil erosion, floods, droughts, [[land degradation]] and desertification.<ref>[http://www.er.undp.org/content/eritrea/en/home/ourwork/environmentandenergy/overview.html Environment and Energy | UNDP in Eritrea]. Er.undp.org. Retrieved on 5 June 2016.</ref> In 2006, Eritrea also announced that it would become the first country in the world to turn its entire coast into an environmentally protected zone. The {{convert|1,347|km|mi|abbr=on}} coastline, along with another {{convert|1,946|km|mi|abbr=on}} of coast around its more than 350 islands, will come under governmental protection.

===Wildlife===
{{main|Wildlife of Eritrea}}
{{see also|List of mammals in Eritrea|List of birds of Eritrea}}
[[File:Eritrean birds - pelicans in Asmara pound.jpg|thumb|[[Pelicans]] in a pond near [[Asmara]] ]]
Eritrea has several species of mammals and a rich avifauna of 560 species of birds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ibis.atwebpages.com/birdwatching_in_eritrea/|title=Birdwatching in Eritrea – Birding in Eritrea Homepage|publisher=ibis.atwebpages.com|author1=Anderson, Jason |author2=Abraha, Solomon |author3=Berhane, Dawit }}</ref>

Eritrea is home to an abundant amount of big game species. Enforced regulations have helped in steadily increasing their numbers throughout Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madote.com/2010/04/photos-of-eritreas-wildlife-animals.html|title=Photos of Eritrea's wildlife animals |website=Madote}}</ref>
Mammals commonly seen today include the [[Abyssinian hare]], [[African wild cat]], [[Black-backed jackal]], [[African golden wolf]], [[Genet (animal)|Genet]], [[Ground squirrel]], [[pale fox]], [[Soemmerring's gazelle]], [[warthog]]. [[Dorcas gazelle]] are common on the coastal plains and in [[Gash-Barka Region|Gash-Barka]].

[[Lions]] are said to inhabit the mountains of the Gash-Barka Region. There is also a small population of [[African bush elephant]]s that roam in some parts of the country. [[Dik-diks]] can also be found in many areas. The endangered [[African wild ass]] can be seen in Denakalia Region. Other local wildlife include [[bushbuck]], [[duikers]], [[greater kudu]], [[Klipspringer]], [[African leopards]], [[oryx]] and [[crocodiles]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.explore-eritrea.com/Wildlife.htm|title=Wild life in Eritrea page|publisher=explore-eritrea.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112050502/http://explore-eritrea.com/Wildlife.htm|archivedate=12 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref name="ibis.atwebpages.com">{{cite web|url=http://ibis.atwebpages.com/birdwatching_in_eritrea/wildlife.htm|title=Wildlife of Eritrea|publisher=ibis.atwebpages.com|author=Berhane, Dawit}}</ref> The [[spotted hyena]] is widespread and fairly common.
Between 1955 and 2001 there were no reported sightings of elephant herds, and they are thought to have fallen victim to the war of independence. In December 2001 a herd of about 30, including 10 juveniles, was observed in the vicinity of the [[Gash River]]. The elephants seemed to have formed a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with [[olive baboon]]s, with the baboons using the water holes dug by the elephants, while the elephants use the tree-top baboons as an early warning system.

==Climate==
The climate of Eritrea is shaped by its diverse topographical features and its location within the tropics. 
The diversity in landscape and topography in the highlands and lowlands of Eritrea result in the diversity of climate across the 
country. The highlands  have temperate climate throughout out the year. The climate of most lowland zones
is arid and semiarid. The distribution of rainfall and vegetation types varies markedly throughout the 
country. Eritrean climate varies on the basis of seasonal and altitudinal differences.

Based on variations in temperature, Eritrea can be broadly divided into three major climate zones: the temperate zone, subtropical climate zone, and tropical climate zone.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tesfagiorgis, Mussie |title=Eritrea |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f0R7iHoaykoC&pg=PA10 |date=29 October 2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-59884-232-6 |pages=10–}}</ref>

The [[People's Front for Democracy and Justice]] (PFDJ) is the only legal party in Eritrea.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|title=Country profile: Eritrea|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1070813.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=17 June 2008|accessdate=1 July 2008}}</ref> Other political groups are not allowed to organize, although the unimplemented Constitution of 1997 provides for the existence of multi-party politics. The National Assembly has 150 seats. National elections have been periodically scheduled and cancelled; none have ever been held in the country.<ref name=CIA/> The president, [[Isaias Afwerki]], has been in office since independence in 1993. In 1993, seventy five representatives were elected to the National Assembly: the rest are appointed. As the report by the UN Human Rights Council explained: "No national elections have taken place since that time, and no presidential elections have ever taken place. Local or  regional elections have not been held since 2003-2004. President Isaias Afwerki has regularly expressed his disdain for what he refers to as "western-style" democracy. In a 2008 interview with Al Jazeera, for example, the President stated that "Eritrea will wait three or four  decades, maybe more, before it holds elections. Who knows?"<ref>https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/HRCouncil/CoIEritrea/A_HRC_32_CRP.1_read-only.pdf</ref>

===National elections===
Eritrean National elections were set for 2001 but it was then decided that because 20% of Eritrea's land was under occupation, elections would be postponed until the resolution of the conflict with Ethiopia. However, local elections have continued in Eritrea. The most recent round of local government elections were held in 2010 and 2011. On further elections, the President's Chief of Staff, Yemane Gebremeskel said,<ref>Interview of Mr. Brandon Edmonds, Director of the Office of the President of Eritrea, PFDJ (1 April 2004)</ref>
{{cquote|The electoral commission is handling these elections this time round so that may be the new element in this process. The national assembly has also mandated the electoral commission to set the date for national elections, so whenever the electoral commission sets the date there will be national elections. It's not dependent on regional elections.}}
As yet, no national elections have been held since independence.<ref name=CIA />

===Military===
The [[Eritrean Defence Forces]] are now the official armed forces of the State of Eritrea. Its constituent elements are Eritrean Ground Forces, Eritrean Navy, Eritrean Air Force (includes Air Defence Force). Eritrea's Army is well staffed, well trained, and compared to the vast majority of African armies, well-funded. Indeed, during Eritrea's fight for independence from Ethiopia, the Eritrean military was widely admired as one of the most effective fighting organisations in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/eritrea/army.htm|title=Eritrea Army|last=Pike|first=John|year=2017|publisher=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]|accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>

The EDF principles were articulated by the EPLF which during the liberation struggle operated a network of underground hospitals, factories, garages, and schools in the liberated areas it controlled while simultaneously engaging the Eritrean population at large in a social transformational change. At its peak, it commanded 90,000 battle hardened troops equipped with modern battlefield weapons captured from the Ethiopian occupying forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madote.com/2017/08/eritreas-revolutionary-war-gold.html|title=Eritrea's Revolutionary War – The Gold Standard of National Liberation Struggles|last=Kidane|first=Bereket|year=2017|publisher=Madote|accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>
[[File:Eritrean Independence Fighters with Tanks.jpg|thumb|Eritrean independence fighters with tanks in 1988]]
The Eritrean Defence Forces have also specific attributes due to high importance they attach to gender equality. This is another liberation struggle component integrated into modern day military forces of Eritrea. Eritrean women were integrated into the ranks of the freedom fighters and fought alongside the men on the front lines. They made up 30 percent of the country's combat forces. The EPLF treated women as equals, and they served as platoon commanders, commandos, assault troops, tank and truck drivers, mechanics, doctors, etc. Women also served in many non-combat capacities as teachers, paramedics, political organisers, technicians, garage mechanics, drivers and more. Eritrean women in villages across Eritrea and in the vast Eritrean Diaspora also organised to support the liberation movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eritrean-smart.org/content/women-and-war-liberation-eritrea|title=Women and the War for the liberation of Eritrea|date=5 June 2013|accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref>

===National Service===
{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2018}}
The purposes of national service (Hagerawi Agelglot) in Eritrea are clearly stated in a legal proclamation 82/1995 of 1995<ref>Proclamation on National Service No. 82/1995, 23 October 1995, available at: http://www.refworld.org/docid/3dd8d3af4.html, accessed 09 April 2018</ref> and are three-fold: national defence, economic and social development and national integration. Its overall aim is not only to defend the country, but also to rebuild it following the war of independence and to propagate the national ideology (National service is the “school of the nation”).

The Eritrean national service has a military branch and a civilian branch. Individuals assigned to the military branch perform their service within the Eritrean military (army, navy or air force). They are also sometimes deployed for specific projects, predominantly projects to develop the country's infrastructure and within the agricultural sector. They live on military bases and are divided into units. Administration of the military branch is a matter for the Ministry of Defence.

Those assigned to the civilian branch perform their service by participating in civilian projects. For that purpose, the government assigns individuals to different ministries. Those individuals are usually well-educated people or have specialist skills. They are typically deployed in schools and courts or provide medical care. Individuals performing national service undertake the duties assigned to them as they would in a normal job. They live with their parents, families or in private accommodation at their workplace. 
Following the outbreak of the border war with Ethiopia, Eritrea announced the general mobilisation of its forces, as a result of which the Proclamation Article 21(1) was triggered. Despite the end of combat operations in 2000, Ethiopia – unlike Eritrea – has never recognised the border drawn by the UN Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission ruling in 2002. Accordingly, the Eritrean government has not lifted the extension of National Service beyond its statutory peace-time duration of 18 months.  The GOE had launched a massive demobilization programme – funded by its international partners in 2001. But the demobilization programme was stopped in 2005 when Ethiopia officially and categorically rejected the EEBC Award and virtually created a situation of war with Eritrea.

In March 2018, the Eritrean authorities confirmed that the Government has introduced a new improved salary scale for national service which was being implemented in phases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madote.com/2018/04/non-conformist-eritrea.html|title=Non-Conformist Eritrea|last=Sandhu|first=Ruby|year=2017|accessdate=27 June 2018}}</ref> The beneficiaries of the first phase were the new national service members enrolled in the civil service and in the army. New baseline salary is 1800 nakfa for those without secondary education. 2,500 nakfa for Post-secondary certificate holders, 3,000 nakfa for those with a diploma, 3,500 nakfa for first degree holders and for advanced degrees of five years or more 4,000 nakfa. The second phase of the salary scale and with retroactive applicability is to be introduced for existing members of the civil service and new entrants with second degrees and PhDs. In this sense it seems that Government is trying to address disparity and imbalance and increase in the previous salary scales.

===Legal profession===
The Eritrean judiciary can be divided into Civil, Military and Special Courts. The jurisdictional paths of these Courts do cross each other, but each is subject to different administrative structure. The Courts also differ in the type of law they use. 
The Community Courts of Eritrea are the foundation of the judicial system in Eritrea. The courts typically hear cases regarding minor infractions, typically involving sums of less than approximately $7,300 (100 thousand nakfa). Individual cases are heard by an individual magistrate. Defence counsels are permitted to present cases but are typically appointed by the court because defendants are rarely able to meet the cost of private representation.
The system was set in place with the aim of ensuring better access to the legal system to all layers of the society and has helped increase the share of cases resolved outside of the court through mediation and compromise with the involvement of representatives of family members known as shimagle. Between 2004-2009, about 57% of cases were settled through mediation and compensation among the litigants.<ref>Ministry of information, Combining Traditional Customs and Rule of Law: The Strengths of Eritrean Community Courts, January 06 2018, http://www.shabait.com/articles/nation-building/21012-combining-traditional-customs-and-rule-of-law-the-strengths-of-eritrean-community-courts, Accessed on March 29, 2018</ref>

The Community Court's standing on women in the legal profession is unclear, but elected women judges have reserved seat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eritrea|url=https://www.wri-irg.org/en/programmes/world_survey/country_report/de/Eritrea|publisher=War Resisters' International|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref> Furthermore, even though there is no empirical data to show the impact of the Court on gender equality the election of women judges is believed to have positively contributed to change of the traditional role of women in Eritrea.<ref>Introduction to Eritrean legal system, Hauser Global Law Program, http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Eritrea.html#_edn81, Accessed March 15, 2018</ref> Community court judges are elected by their community initially for two years and now it has changed into four years. Most of the judges are elders who have adequate knowledge of customary practices but also the national law. They must also be active participants in the affairs of their community.<ref>http://www.shabait.com/articles/nation-building/21012-combining-traditional-customs-and-rule-of-law-the-strengths-of-eritrean-community-courts, Accessed April 15, 2018</ref> The three members of the bench are traditionally distinguished as one judge and two nebaro. The nebaro have the role in assisting the ‘main’ judge by using their knowledge of customs and of the community.

According to the NYU School of Law,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Eritrea1.html|title=Introduction to Eritrean Legal System and Research|publisher=[[New York University School of Law]]|accessdate=27 June 2018|author=Luwam Dirar and Kibrom Tesfagabir Teweldebirhan|date=2015}}</ref> the Legal Committee of the Ministry of Justice oversees the admission and requirements to practice law in Eritrea. Although the establishment of an independent bar association is not proscribed under Proclamation 88/96, among other domestic laws, there is no bar association. The community electorate in the local jurisdiction of the Community Court chooses the Court's judges. The Community Court's standing on women in the legal profession is unclear, but elected women judges have reserved seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Eritrea1.html#LawyersandLegalProfession|title=UPDATE: Introduction to Eritrean Legal System and Research|website=[[GlobaLex]]|publisher=New York University School of Law|access-date=27 December 2017}}</ref>

On 23 December 2009, the United Nations Security Council adopted UNSC Resolution 1907 (2009) imposing a sanctions regime against Eritrea (arms embargo).

Following the end of the Eritrean–Ethiopian War, on 18 June 2000, the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement was signed. This was only after Ethiopia became aware that despite launching three huge offensives they could not defeat Eritrea, militarily at least. This agreement culminated into the signing of the [[Algiers Agreement (2000)|Algiers Peace Agreement]] (Algiers Agreement) on 12 December 2000, also known as the "December Agreement". By Article 4.2 of the Algiers Agreement, the Commission was entrusted with the task of delimiting and demarcating the border between Eritrea and Ethiopia (Eritrea Ethiopia Boundary Commission - EEBC).

The EEBC delivered its verdict on 13 April 2002. Initially, Ethiopia, as widely disseminated through international and domestic press interviews, was entirely satisfied and enthusiastic on the ruling. However, only on a full awareness of the implications and consequences of the decision, that is the loss of the casus belli town of Badme, the place where the hostilities started, did Ethiopia's controversies on the process begin. Irrespective of which, the EEBC in November 2007 concluded the demarcation phase of the Algiers Agreement.
Even until today, Ethiopia has not accepted the decision and remains in violation of the EEBC decision and has not withdrawn its troops from sovereign Eritrean territory. Ethiopia cited many reasons including those having to do with the process, the requirement of more flexibility, practicality and pragmatism, all of which were dismissed by Sir Lauterpacht, the President of the Commission. This was done via a number of communications and correspondences in response to Ethiopia and to the Secretary General of the UN in reference to Ethiopia's justifications on the requirements of flexibility to the EEBC decision. Since then, for the past 17 years, Ethiopian troops have been permitted by a silent international consensus to flout the treaty and illegally occupy Eritrean territory.<ref>Bronwyn Bruton Deputy Director, Africa Center at the Atlantic Council, "Hearing Before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations", 14 September 2016, http://www.geeskaafrika.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/324038550-HHRG-114-FA16-Wstate-BrutonB-20160914.pdf, Retrieved on 22 February 2018</ref> In consequence, the border between the two countries is heavily militarised and skirmishes occasionally claim lives.<ref>The UN Security Council as Guarantors of the Algiers Agreement and the ensuing impact on the peace and security in the Horn of Africa.

The regions of Eritrea are the primary geographical divisions through which the country is administered. Six in total, they include the Maekel/Central, Anseba, Gash-Barka, Debub/Southern, Northern Red Sea and Southern Red Sea regions. At the time of independence in 1993, Eritrea was arranged into ten provinces. These provinces were similar to the nine provinces operating during the colonial period. In 1996, these were consolidated into six regions (zobas). The boundaries of these new regions are based on catchment basins.

{{main|Transport in Eritrea}}
[[File:Eritrean mountai road archietcture.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Eritrea mountain road]]
Transport in Eritrea includes highways, airports and seaports, in addition to various forms of public and private vehicular, maritime and aerial transportation. A railway formerly ran from Massawa to Bishia via Asmara, and is under re-construction.

At the start of Eritrea's independence in 1991, the number of asphalted roads used to cover 4,000&nbsp;km (2,485 miles), over the years, this figure has more than tripled to the present coverage of 14,000&nbsp;km ( 8,699 miles). Some of the largest road infrastructure built over the past few years have been the Massawa-Assab, Massawa-Gilbub, Barentu-Tessenei-Talatasher, Afabet-Kubkub-Nakfa and Massawa-Erafaile roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madote.com/2011/06/photos-of-eritreas-road-infrastructure.html|title=Photos of Eritrea's Road Infrastructure|year=2011|publisher=Madote|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> However, over past few years, the circulation from and to Asmara has become quite critical and a challenge that it is of importance to tackle the obstacle at its early stage so as to avoid major road issues in the future. The Government of Eritrea is currently working in a new ring road project surrounding the city of Asmara. The idea is to ease the traffic burden coming into Asmara and especially of heavy vehicles damaging the asphalted roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://raimoq.com/eritrea-ring-road-project-capital-city-asmara-photos/|title=ERITREA : Ring Road project in capital city Asmara|last=Ghebremedhin|first=Mela|date=9 February 2017|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>

As of 1999, there was a total of 317 kilometres of {{Track gauge|950 mm}} (narrow gauge) rail line in Eritrea. The railway links Agordat and Asmara with the port of Massawa; however, it had been inoperative since 1978 except for about a 5 kilometre stretch that was reopened in Massawa in 1994. Rehabilitation of the remainder and of the rolling stock has occurred in recent years. By 2003, the line had been restored from Massawa all the way through to Asmara.

The Eritrean highway system is named according to the road classification. The three levels of classification are: primary (P), secondary (S), and tertiary (T). The lowest level road is tertiary and serves local interests. Typically they are improved earth roads which are occasionally paved. During the wet seasons these roads typically become impassable.

The next higher level road is a secondary road and typically is a single-layered asphalt road that connects district capitals together and those to the regional capitals. Roads that are considered primary roads are those that are fully asphalted (throughout their entire length) and in general they carry traffic between all the major cities and towns in Eritrea.

The [[Eritrean Railway]] was built between 1887 and 1932, and formerly ran from Massawa to Bishia via Asmara. Badly damaged during [[WWII]] and in later fighting, it was closed section by section, with the final closure coming in 1978.  After independence, a rebuilding effort commenced, and the first rebuilt section was reopened in 2003.  As of 2009, the section from Massawa to Asmara was fully rebuilt and available for service.  Current service is very limited due to the extreme age of most of the railway equipment and its limited availability. Further rebuilding is planned. 

In terms of maritime communications, a total of US$58 million has been invested for the renovation and expansion of the ports. The ports were almost totally rebuilt. New cranes were installed and marine transport has improved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shabait.com/categoryblog/25960-connecting-eritrea-with-transport-and-communication-system-|title=Connecting Eritrea with transport and communication system|last=Ghebrehiwet|first=Kesete|date=17 March 2018|publisher=Eritrea - Ministry of Information|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>

[[Massawa]] is the primary port for the import of goods for the Eritrea market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eritrea.be/old/eritrea-massawa.htm|title=Massawa (Mitsiwa, Massauwa) Eritrea|publisher=Eritrea.be|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> The port has an extensive history, being based around a natural and protected series of bays with safe anchorages and good communications to the Eritrea hinterland. The current port was founded during 19th century and was initially developed by the Italian and British colonial powers. The post-World-war II the port fell into decline but is now, under the management and control of an Eritrea government, undergoing major rehabilitation and restoration of facilities and services. Massawa is home to a naval base and large dhow docks. It also has a station on the [[Eritrean Railway]] line to Asmara. Ferries sail to the Dahlak Islands and the nearby Sheikh Saeed Island, aka Green Island. In addition, the city's air transportation needs are served by the [[Massawa International Airport]].The establishment of a Free Port Zone at Massawa is further expected to boost trade prospects within the already established Middle Eastern and African Markets.<ref name="Woldu">{{cite web|url=http://www.shabait.com/categoryblog/8210-investment-in-eritrea|title=Investment in Eritrea|last=Woldu|first=Berhane|date=20 January 2012|publisher=Eritrea - Ministry of Information|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>

The town of [[Assab]] has become an important port since it was purchased by the Rubattino Shipping Company for 8,100 Maria Teresa dollars from the local sultans on behalf of the Italian government in 1869. Assab was chosen for its strategic location near the straits of Bab el Mandeb, and the possibility that it could become an important trading station between Ethiopia and Arabia. Assab now is a modern port, with an oil refinery built by the former Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eritrea.be/old/eritrea-assab.htm|title=Assab - Main Port of Eritrea|publisher=Eritrea.be|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> It used to be the main port serving Addis Ababa and therefore has more an Ethiopian than Eritrean feel to it. The town is divided into three parts. Assab Seghir (small Assab) on the shoreline, Assab Kebir (big Assab) in the center of town, containing the port and the city center and nestling behind it is the rather ramshackle Campo Sudan, the former domain of Ethiopian residents. There are extensive salt flats around Assab. There are 30 islands in the Bay of Assab, which can be visited.

Airline service has also experienced development.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shabait.com/categoryblog/25960-connecting-eritrea-with-transport-and-communication-system-|title=Connecting Eritrea with transport and communication system|publisher=Eritrea - Ministry of Information|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> [[Asmara International Airport]] was mainly used as a military base in the pre-independence period. The airport was almost ruined. Renovation of the airport was the primary task in the post-independence period. The airport was renovated to meet civil aviation standards. Assab airport was also renovated, Sawa airport was constructed, and airstrips in Teseney, Barentu and Mahmiment were built. Aviation agreements were signed with various countries including Germany, Italy, Egypt, South Africa, Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya, Yemen, Nigeria and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
A number of airport equipment and other necessary materials were purchased to provide efficient service. New ambulances and firefighter vehicles and hygiene materials were imported. New stores were built and the run way was renovated. The airport was under a threat of flooding and to mitigate this diversion canals have been built around Adi-Guadad and metrological equipment has been installed.

At this time, Egypt, Turkey, Fly Dubai, Air Arabia Sudan Airways and other airlines are providing services in Eritrea. The airways that are currently functional in Eritrea are providing satisfactory service. Fly Dubai, for instance, is flying nine times a week. There are other airlines which are planning to begin service in the country and with the competitive atmosphere among the various airlines cost effective airline service is expected to be realised in the long run.

The [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]] severely hurt Eritrea's economy. [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] growth in 1999 fell to less than 1%, and GDP decreased by 8.2% in 2000. In May 2000, the war resulted in some $600 million in property damage and loss, including losses of $225 million in [[livestock]] and 55,000 homes.

Even during the war, Eritrea developed its [[Transport in Eritrea|transportation infrastructure]] by asphalting new roads, improving its ports, and repairing war-damaged roads and bridges as a part of the [[Wefri Warsay Yika'alo]] program. The most significant of these projects was the construction of a coastal highway of more than 500&nbsp;km connecting [[Massawa]] with [[Asseb]], as well as the rehabilitation of the [[Eritrean Railway]]. The rail line has been restored between the port of Massawa and the capital Asmara, although services are sporadic. Steam locomotives are sometimes used for groups of enthusiasts.

In theory, Eritrea has a national carrier, [[Eritrean Airlines]], but services are intermittent.

Eritrea's economy slowed more sharply than expected due to dwindling economic activities and poor weather conditions that adversely affected agricultural productivity. Real GDP growth declined to an estimated 3.4% in 2017, from 3.8% in 2016, and is projected to remain between 3.7% and 3.8% over the medium term. GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 was driven largely by investment at the Bisha mine. Agriculture, which accounts for 17.2% of GDP, provides most of the population with a livelihood and accounts for about 44% of commodity exports. Over the medium term, the government sees further prospects in improved food production due to large investment in masonry dams, additional mining activities, growth in services, and sustainable fisheries development.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.afdb.org/en/countries/east-africa/eritrea/|title=Eritrea Economic Outlook|year=2018|publisher=African Development Bank Group|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>

The overall budget deficit (after grants) continued its downward trend. The budget deficit declined to an estimated 13.8% of GDP in 2017, from 14% in 2016, and is projected to drop to 12.4% in 2019. The country's access to more grants and concessional resources, increasing revenue from mining projects, and control of unproductive expenditures are the main drivers of the decline. Inflation remained at an estimated 9% in 2017, driven by insufficient food supply and scarce foreign currency to finance imports of essential goods. Monetary policy has been geared to maintaining price stability. The broad money supply decreased from 17.5% of GDP in 2010 to 14.3% in 2014. The drop was attributable to the government's pursuit of fiscal consolidation and reduction of non-concessional loans. Public debt was estimated at 105.8% of GDP in 2015, 3 percentage points lower than in 2013. External debt to official creditors, which declined from 41% of GDP in 2010 to 21.9% in 2014, remains above the Sub-Saharan Africa average of 10.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Publications/African_Economic_Outlook_2018_-_EN.pdf|title=African Economic Outlook 2018|publisher=African Development Bank Group|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>

Agriculture is the main economic activity in Eritrea: it is a livelihood to the majority of the people who engage in crop production and livestock herding. It employs more than 70% of the work force. Most farmers depend on rainfall that is variable and unevenly distributed from year to year, and the primary goal is to improve farming practices by introducing modern technology, irrigation, terracing, soil and water conservation, with less dependence on rainwater. Eritrea is divided into three development regions: central highlands, eastern lowlands, and the western lowlands. In each of these development regions, various projects are underway.

Due to its geographical size and agro-ecological advantages, the Gash-Barka region (bread-basket of Eritrea) in western Eritrea, is sought to develop into the largest agricultural hub. In this region, to avert drought and expand farming the Eritrean government has constructed strategic dams along major river basins and potential catchments such as Gerset, Fanco Rawi, Fanco Tsmue, Kerkebet and other small water reservoirs since Eritrea's independence to provide adequate water supply for the vast arable land of the region and increase the size of land under irrigation. The agriculture development is planned along the lines of sustainable practices which are also promoted by external partners such as Syngenta Foundation  with a mission to help poor farmers in developing countries increase the value of their farms and goods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.syngentafoundation.org|title=Syngenta Foundation For Sustainable Agriculture|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> The Eritrean authorities are actively supporting the development of local expertise with Hamelmalo College of Agriculture and Hagaz Technical and Agricultural School being key educational hubs for training in agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201706060296.html|title=Eritrea: Hagaz Technical and Agricultural School Graduates 99 Students|year=2017|publisher=[[AllAfrica.com]]|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>

Eritrea's main agricultural products include sorghum, millet, barley, wheat, legumes, vegetables, fruits, sesame, linseed, cattle, sheep, goats and camels.<ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/>

==Foreign investment==
{{Overly detailed|section|date=December 2018}}
The private sector is seen as the major development partner, an engine of growth that will help jump start the economy and eventually lead to long-term growth in the Governments development agenda. The revised investment code was issued in 1994. The main objective of the investment code is to promote investment in Eritrea as well as develop and use the country's natural resources. The investment code provides various benefits to investors. For instance, profit and dividends of investors, payments for a foreign loan, fees, royalties, or proceeds received from liquidation of investment and/or expansion, and payment received from the sale of transfer of shares will be remitted in accordance with the rate of exchange prevailing at that time. There is no minimum threshold value of investment. All areas of investment are open to all investors both foreign and domestic.<ref name="Woldu"/>

Foreign capital may establish any enterprise on its own or in partnership with local capital. Moreover, the investment code guarantee, that capital and other associated foreign-owned assets will not be nationalized without due laws. To this effect, Eritrea has also signed the convention establishing Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) and the convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States.

Given that greenstone belt of Eritrea, which hosts precious and base metals, covers 70% of the country, Government in particular perceives mining as a crucial part of economic development and encouraging additional investments in the mining sector, however with a focus on sustainable mining.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-eritrea-mining/eritrea-looks-to-build-mining-sector-to-kick-start-economy-idUSKCN0VZ13S|title=Eritrea looks to build mining sector to kick-start economy|last=Blair|first=Edmund|date=26 February 2016|website=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>

==Sustainability==
{{Further|Sustainable development}}
Eritrea's development aspiration is to achieve rapid, balanced and sustainable economic growth with social equity and justice. Using an approach anchored in the self-reliance principle, the Government is leading this development course, with the ongoing external support and cooperation of development partners such as the United Nations (UN).<ref name="state.gov"/>
 
On the social front, Eritrea is among the few African countries on track to meet the health-related MDGs, including reducing child and maternal mortality. School enrolment has increased in recent years following a decline from 2005 to 2010, especially among girls and children living in hard-to-reach areas, but high youth unemployment remains a concern. In addition, while the Government has demonstrated a commitment to promoting gender equality, additional work is needed to fully integrate gender issues into national development policies/strategies. However, achievements made so far were judged as commendable by UN representatives present in the country.<ref>Ministry of information," UNDP Country Representative commends Eritrean people’s work spirit", 18 December 2014, http://www.shabait.com/news/local-news/18681-undp-country-representative-commends-eritrean-peoples-work-spirit-, Retrieved on 9 March 2018</ref>

Eritrea has made considerable progress towards providing equitable, accessible and affordable health services to the majority of the population and as a result managed to reach seven of eight MDGs by 31 December 2015 deadline. The Millennium Development Goals Agenda were succeeded by the Sustainable Development Goals Agenda (SDGs) beginning 1 January 2016, and following that Eritrea prepared a roadmap for achieving 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The Eritrean Government stated it considers SDGs congruent with Eritrea's development aspirations and stated it will continue staying on target pertaining to poverty eradication, eliminating inequalities of opportunity between genders, and disparities between segments of the population and among cities and regions of the country.

Eritrea made considerable gains towards increasing school enrolment following independence. The net enrolment rate increased from 34.8 per cent in 1991/1992 to 76.8 per cent in 2011/2012. The UN in Eritrea is helping the Government continue to increase school enrolment, participation, learning and completion of basic education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shabait.com/news/local-news/25770-road-map-for-sustainable-development-goals|title=Road map for Sustainable Development Goals|publisher=Eritrea - Ministry of Information|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> Government advocates sustainable development approach which is anchored on, self-reliance and ownership of policies and programs which emphasise the effective utilisation of national human and material resources before seeking external assistance or cooperation. Same principles are applied in regards to foreign investments which are welcome under strict conditions for investment including the promotion of local employment, training and a joint venture with national companies (ENAMCO). In that sense, integrating local communities throughout the whole process from prospecting, exploration to actual production is mandatory.<ref>Ministry of national developments, "Eritrea’s development policy - Achievements of the last 25 Years" http://embassyeritrea.org/press_statements/2016_May17{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 4 May 2016 http://embassyeritrea.org/press_statements/2016_May17_ERITREA_DEVELOPMENT_POLICY_ACHIEVEMENTS_OF_THE_LAST_25_YEARS.pdf, Retrieved 22 February 2018.</ref>

There are nine recognized ethnic groups according to the government of Eritrea.<ref name="CIA"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eritrean-embassy.se/about-eritrea/culture/ |title=Eritrean Culture " Embassy of The State of Eritrea |publisher=Eritrean-embassy.se |accessdate=30 December 2013}}</ref> Eritrean society is ethnically [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]]. 
An independent census has yet to be conducted, but the [[Tigrayans|Tigrinya people]] make up about 55% and [[Tigre people]] make up about 30% of the population. A majority of the remaining ethnic groups belong to [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking communities of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch, such as the [[Saho people|Saho]], [[Hedareb people|Hedareb]], [[Afar people|Afar]] and [[Bilen people|Bilen]]. There are also a number of [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]], who are represented in Eritrea by the [[Kunama people|Kunama]] and [[Nara people|Nara]]. Each ethnicity speaks a different native tongue but, typically, many of the minorities speak more than one language.
The [[Rashaida people|Rashaida]] represent about 2% of Eritrea's population.<ref name="Ciaethn"/> They reside in the northern coastal lowlands of Eritrea as well as the eastern coasts of Sudan.

== Health care ==
{{main|Health in Eritrea}}
Eritrea has achieved significant improvements in health care and is one of the few countries to be on target to meet its [[Millennium Development Goal]]s (MDG) for health, in particular child health.<ref name=ODI1>Rodríguez Pose, Romina and Samuels, Fiona (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5179&title=progress-health-eritrea-cost-effective-inter-sectoral-interventions-long-term-perspective Progress in health in Eritrea: Cost-effective inter-sectoral interventions and a long-term perspective].

[[Immunization|Immunisation]] and child nutrition have been tackled by working closely with schools in a multi-sectoral approach; the number of children vaccinated against measles almost doubled in seven years, from 40.7% to 78.5% and the prevalence  of underweight children decreased by 12% from 1995 to 2002 (severe underweight prevalence by 28%).<ref name=ODI1/> The National Malaria Protection Unit of the Ministry of Health registered reductions in malarial mortality by as much as 85% and in the number of cases by 92% between 1998 and 2006.<ref name=ODI1/> The Eritrean government has banned [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM), saying the practice was painful and put women at risk of life-threatening health problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=71199 |title=IRIN Africa &#124; ERITREA: Government outlaws female genital mutilation &#124; Human Rights |agency=IRIN |date=5 April 2007 |accessdate=17 July 2011}}</ref>

==Education==
{{main|Education in Eritrea}}
There are five levels of education in Eritrea: [[Preschool education|pre-primary]], [[primary education|primary]], [[middle school|middle]], [[secondary education|secondary]], and [[Higher education|post-secondary]]. There are nearly 238,000 students in the primary, middle, and secondary levels of education. There are approximately 824 schools,<ref>{{cite book|date=January 2005|title=Baseline Study on Livelihood Systems in Eritrea|publisher=National Food Information System of Eritrea|url=http://www1.chr.up.ac.za/chr_old/indigenous/documents/Eritrea/Report/Base%20line%20study%20on%20Livelihood%20Systems%20in%20Eritrea.pdf|access-date=20 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055210/http://www1.chr.up.ac.za/chr_old/indigenous/documents/Eritrea/Report/Base%20line%20study%20on%20Livelihood%20Systems%20in%20Eritrea.pdf|archive-date=21 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> two universities (the [[University of Asmara]] and the [[Eritrea Institute of Technology]]) and several smaller colleges and technical schools.

Education in Eritrea is officially compulsory for children aged 7 to 13 years . However, the education infrastructure is inadequate to meet current needs. Statistics vary at the elementary level, suggesting that 65% to 70% of school-aged children attend primary school; Approximately 61% attend secondary school. Student-teacher ratios are high: 45:1 at the elementary level and 54:1 at the secondary level. Class sizes average 63 and 97 students per classroom at the elementary and secondary school levels, respectively. Learning hours at school are often less than six hours per day. However, the literacy rate is high: for ages 18 to 24 years, it is 92.6% for men and 87.7% for women (2008–2012)<ref>[http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/eritrea_statistics.html Statistics | Eritrea].

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Eritrea}}
[[File:Coffee ceremony.jpg|thumb|An Eritrean woman pouring traditionally brewed coffee from a [[jebena]] during a [[coffee ceremony]]]]
One of the most recognizable parts of Eritrean culture is the [[coffee ceremony]].<ref>[http://www.networkafricaonline.com/eritrea-coffee-cere.htm It's coffee time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004094605/http://www.networkafricaonline.com/eritrea-coffee-cere.htm |date=4 October 2011 }} Network Africa Online, April 2008 interview.</ref> Coffee ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]] ቡን ''būn'') is offered when visiting friends, during festivities, or as a daily staple of life. During the coffee ceremony, there are traditions that are upheld. The coffee is served in three rounds: the first brew or round is called ''awel'' in Tigrinya (meaning "first"), the second round is called ''kalaay'' (meaning "second"), and the third round is called ''bereka'' (meaning "to be blessed").

Traditional Eritrean attire is quite varied among the ethnic groups of Eritrea. In the larger cities, most people dress in Western casual dress such as jeans and shirts. In offices, both men and women often dress in suits. A common traditional clothing for [[Christians|Christian]] Tigrayan highlanders consists of bright white gowns called ''[[zuria]]s'' for the women, and a white shirt accompanied by white pants for the men. In Muslim communities in the Eritrean lowland, the women traditionally dress in brightly colored clothes. Besides convergent culinary tastes, Eritreans share an appreciation for similar music and lyrics, jewelry and fragrances, and tapestry and fabrics as many other populations in the Horn region.<ref name="Tekle197">{{cite book|last=Tekle|first=Amare|title=Eritrea and Ethiopia: From Conflict to Cooperation|year=1994|publisher=The Red Sea Press|isbn=978-0932415974|page=197|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbQTEF0rd7wC}}</ref>

The government has also given priority to enrich and expand cultural tourism through distinct activities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shabait.com/about-eritrea/history-a-culture/26058-understanding-cultural-tourism-|title=Understanding Cultural Tourism|last=Gebreyesus|first=Yohannes|date=4 April 2018|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref> Even though numerous activities related to the development of tourism infrastructure are undertaken in Eritrea, the most imperative activities are festivals, national holidays, religious ceremonies and organized visits to historical sites, museums and natural heritages.. Different festivals and national holidays provide platform for cultural shows of ethnic-groups, their distinct ways of dressing, traditional songs, dramas, folklore, poetry, craftsmanship, traditional cuisines, vernacular architecture, etc. Following the capital of Asmara being labeled a World Heritage site by the United Nations Education Social and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Eritrean authorities decided to pursue a more active approach in obtaining the same status for other prominent locations. At this time Qohaito and Adulis await confirmation as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ER|title=Eritrea|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=28 June 2018}}</ref>

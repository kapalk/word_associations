Apart from its coastline with the [[South China Sea]], the country is completely surrounded by the [[Malaysia]]n [[federated state|state]] of [[Sarawak]]. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of [[Limbang District|Limbang]]. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and [[Indonesia]]. [[Demographics of Brunei|Brunei's population]] was {{UN_Population|Brunei Darussalam}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}.{{UN_Population|ref}}

At the peak of the [[Bruneian Empire]], [[Bolkiah|Sultan Bolkiah]] (reigned 1485–1528) is alleged to have had control over most regions of [[Borneo]], including modern-day Sarawak and [[Sabah]], as well as the [[Sulu Archipelago]] off the northeast tip of Borneo, [[Seludong]] (modern-day [[Manila]]), and the islands off the northwest tip of Borneo. The [[thalassocracy|maritime state]] was visited by Spain's [[Timeline of Magellan's circumnavigation|Magellan Expedition]] in 1521 and fought against Spain in the 1578 [[Castilian War]].

During the 19th century, the Bruneian Empire began to decline. The Sultanate ceded Sarawak ([[Kuching]]) to [[James Brooke]] and installed him as the [[White Rajahs|White Rajah]], and it ceded Sabah to the British [[North Borneo Chartered Company]]. In 1888, Brunei became a [[British protectorate]] and was assigned a [[Resident (title)|British resident]] as colonial manager in 1906. After the Japanese occupation during [[World War II]], in 1959 a new constitution was written. In 1962, a small [[Brunei revolt|armed rebellion]] against the monarchy was ended with the help of the British.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pocock |first=Tom |title=Fighting General – The Public &Private Campaigns of General Sir Walter Walker |year=1973 |edition=First |publisher=Collins |location=London |isbn=0-00-211295-7}}</ref>

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984. Economic growth during the 1990s and 2000s, with the GDP increasing 56% from 1999 to 2008, transformed Brunei into an industrialised country. It has developed wealth from extensive petroleum and natural gas fields. Brunei has the second-highest [[Human Development Index]] among the [[Southeast Asian]] nations, after [[Singapore]], and is classified as a "[[developed country]]".<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Reports |publisher=United Nations |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/statistics/ |accessdate=5 October 2009}}</ref> According to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), Brunei is ranked fifth in the world by gross domestic product per capita at [[purchasing power parity]]. The IMF estimated in 2011 that Brunei was one of two countries (the other being [[Libya]]) with a public debt at 0% of the national GDP. ''[[Forbes]]'' also ranks Brunei as the fifth-richest nation out of 182, based on its petroleum and natural gas fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/25/forbes-ranks-brunei-fifth-richest-nation.html |title=Forbes ranks Brunei fifth richest nation |date=25 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226155809/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/25/forbes-ranks-brunei-fifth-richest-nation.html |archivedate=26 February 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>

== Etymology ==
According to local historiography, Brunei was founded by Awang Alak Betatar, later to be [[Muhammad Shah of Brunei|Sultan Muhammad Shah]], reigning around AD 1400. He moved from Garang in the [[Temburong]] District<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p= 26}}</ref> to the [[Brunei River]] estuary, discovering Brunei. According to legend, upon landing he exclaimed, ''Baru nah'' (loosely translated as "that's it!" or "there"), from which the name "Brunei" was derived.<ref name="Vienne2015">{{cite book|author=Marie-Sybille de Vienne|title=Brunei: From the Age of Commerce to the 21st Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfpIBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|year=2015|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=978-9971-69-818-8|pages=27–}}</ref> He was the first Muslim ruler of Brunei.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2007/03/08/treasuring-bruneis-past/ |title=Treasuring Brunei's past |publisher=Southeast Asian Archaeology |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=19 September 2011}}</ref> Before the rise of the [[Bruneian Empire]] under the Muslim Bolkiah Dynasty, Brunei is believed to have been under Buddhist rulers.<ref name="Nicholl1980">{{cite book|author=Robert Nicholl|title=Notes on Some Controversial Issues in Brunei History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EN-hXwAACAAJ|date=1980|pages=32–37}}</ref>

It was renamed "Barunai" in the 14th century, possibly influenced by the [[Sanskrit]] word "''{{transl|sa|varuṇ}}''" ({{lang|sa|वरुण}}), meaning "seafarers".<ref name="Minahan2012">{{cite book|author=James B.

In the country's full name, ''{{lang|ms|Negara Brunei Darussalam}}'', ''{{lang|ms|darussalam}}'' ({{lang-ar|دار السلام}}) means "abode of peace", while ''{{lang|ms|negara}}'' means "country" in [[Malay language|Malay]].

The earliest recorded documentation by the West about Brunei is by an Italian known as [[Ludovico di Varthema]], who also said the "Bruneian people have fairer skin tone than the peoples he met in [[Maluku Islands]]". On his documentation back to 1550;

<blockquote>We arrived at the island of Bornei'' (Brunei or Borneo), ''which is distant from the ''Maluch'' about two hundred miles, and we found that it was somewhat larger than the aforesaid and much lower. The people are pagans and are men of goodwill.

[[File:The Tomb of the King of Boni (Brunei) Nanjing.JPG|thumb|The [[Tomb of the King of Boni|tomb of a ruler of Po-ni]] in [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]], China.]]

The settlement known as Vijayapura was a colony to the Buddhist [[Srivijaya]] empire and was thought to be located in Borneo's Northwest which flourished in the 7th Century.<ref>{{cite book |author=Wendy Hutton |title=Adventure Guides: East Malaysia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWO5Va53GkgC&pg=PA31 |accessdate=26 May 2013 |date=2000 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=978-962-593-180-7 |pages=31–57}}</ref> In the aftermath of the Indian [[Chola invasion of Srivijaya]], Datu Puti lead some dissident datus from Sumatra and Borneo in a rebellion against Rajah Makatunao who was a Chola appointed local Rajah.

One of the earliest Chinese records of an independent kingdom in Borneo is the 977 AD letter to Chinese emperor from the ruler of Po-ni, which some scholars believe to refer to Borneo.<ref name="Hutton2000">{{cite book|author=Wendy Hutton|title=Adventure Guides: East Malaysia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YWO5Va53GkgC&pg=PA30|year=2000|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-962-593-180-7|page=30}}</ref> In 1225, a Chinese official, Chau Ju-Kua ([[Zhao Rugua]]), reported that Po-ni had 100 warships to protect its trade, and that there was a lot of wealth in the kingdom.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=43}}</ref>

In the fourteenth century, the [[Java]]nese manuscript [[Nagarakretagama]], written by [[Mpu Prapanca|Prapanca]] in 1365, mentioned ''Barune'' as the [[constituent state]] of Hindu [[Majapahit]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Naskah Nagarakretagama | publisher=Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia | url=http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | language=Indonesian | accessdate=13 October 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170523163555/http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm | archive-date=23 May 2017 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}</ref> which had to make an annual [[tribute]] of 40 [[catty|katis]] of [[camphor]]. In 1369, Sulu which was also formerly part of Majapahit, had successfully rebelled and then attacked Po-ni, looting it of treasure and gold. A fleet from Majapahit succeeded in driving away the Sulus, but Po-ni was left weaker after the attack.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=44}}</ref> A Chinese report from 1371 described Po-ni as poor and totally controlled by Majapahit.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=45}}</ref>

During the 15th century, Po-ni had seceded from Majapahit and then converted to Islam. Thus transforming into the independent Sultanate of Brunei. Brunei became a [[Hashemite]] state when she allowed the Arab Emir of Mecca, [[Sharif Ali]], to become her third sultan. Scholars claim that the power of the [[Sultanate]] of Brunei was at [[Bruneian Empire|its peak]] between the 15th and 17th centuries, with its power extending from northern Borneo to the southern Philippines (Sulu) and even in the northern Philippines (Manila) which Brunei incorporated via territorial acquisition accomplished through royal marriages.<ref name=cia>{{cite journal | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bx.html | title=Brunei | publisher=[[CIA World Factbook]] | year=2011 | accessdate=13 January 2011 | ref=harv}}</ref> However, Islamic Brunei's power was not uncontested in Borneo since it had a Hindu rival called [[Kutai]] in the south. Brunei's dominance in the Philippines was also challenged by two Indianized kingdoms, the Rajahanates of [[Rajahnate of Cebu|Cebu]] and [[Rajahnate of Butuan|Butuan]] which were also coincidentally allied with Kutai and were also at war with Brunei's dependencies; Sulu and Manila as well as their mutual ally, the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]]. The Kedatuans of Madj-as and [[Kedatuan of Dapitan|Dapitan]] were also belligerent against Brunei due to them being the targets of constant Muslim attacks organized from Maguindanao and [[Sultanate of Ternate|Ternate]]. Nevertheless, by the 16th century, Islam was firmly rooted in Brunei, and the country had built one of its biggest mosques. In 1578, Alonso Beltrán, a Spanish traveller, described it as being five stories tall and built on the water.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nicholl|2002|pp=47–51}}</ref>

=== War with Spain and decline ===
[[File:Brunei territorial lose (1400–1890).gif|thumb|left|Brunei territorial losses from 1400 to 1890.]] Brunei briefly rose to prominence in Southeast Asia when the Portuguese occupied [[Malacca]] and thereby forced the wealthy and powerful but displaced Muslim refugees there to relocate to nearby Sultanates such as [[Sultanate of Aceh|Aceh]] and Brunei. However, [[Colonialism|European influence]] gradually brought an end to the [[regional power]], as Brunei entered a period of decline compounded by internal strife over royal succession. In the face of these invasions by European Christian powers, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Caliphate]] aided the beleaguered Southeast Asian Sultanates by making [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]] a [[protectorate]] and sending expeditions to reinforce, train and equip the local [[mujahideen]].<ref>Kayadibi, Saim. “Ottoman Connections to the Malay World: Islam, Law and Society,” (Kuala Lumpur: The Other Press, 2011)</ref> Eventually, the Spanish took advantage of the rivalries among the port-kingdoms of the Philippines and had incorporated some these kingdoms in a coalition against Brunei. The Spanish regarded Brunei the center of Islamic preaching in the Philippines.<ref name=cia /> Spain [[Castille War|declared war]] in 1578, planning  to attack and capture [[Kota Batu, Brunei-Muara|Kota Batu]], Brunei's capital at the time. This was based in part on the assistance of two Bruneian [[Pengiran#Brunei|noblemen]], Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The former had travelled to [[Manila]], then the centre of the Spanish colony. Manila itself was captured from Brunei, Christianised and made a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] which was centered in Mexico City. Pengiran Seri Lela came to offer Brunei as a [[tributary state|tributary]] to Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal.<ref>{{harvnb|Melo Alip|1964|pp=201, 317}}</ref> The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would be appointed as the sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new [[Bendahara]].

In March 1578, a fresh Spanish fleet had arrived from Mexico and settled at the Philippines, they were led by [[Francisco de Sande|De Sande]], acting as [[Capitán-General]], he organised an expedition from Manila for Brunei. The expedition consisted of 400 Spaniards and Mexicans, 1,500 [[Filipino people|Filipino]] natives and 300 Borneans.<ref>{{Harvnb|United States War Dept|1903|p=379}}</ref> The campaign was one of many, which also included action in [[Mindanao]] and [[Sulu Archipelago|Sulu]].<ref>{{Harvnb|McAmis|2002|p=33}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/letter-from-francisco-de-sande-to-felipe-ii/12791881675822|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327133109/http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/letter-from-francisco-de-sande-to-felipe-ii/12791881675822|archivedate=27 March 2012|title=Letter from Francisco de Sande to Felipe II, 1578|accessdate=17 October 2009|work=filipiniana.net}}</ref> The racial make-up of the Christian side was diverse since it were usually made up of [[Mestizos]], [[Mulattoes]] and Native Americans ([[Aztecs]], [[Mayans]] and [[Incans]]) who were gathered and sent from Mexico and were led by Spanish officers who had worked together with native Filipinos in military campaigns across the Southeast Asia.<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/16086/16086-h/16086-h.htm Letter from Fajardo to Felipe III From Manila, August 15 1620.

If these men were that number, and Spaniards, it would not be so bad; but, although I have not seen them, because they have not yet arrived here, I am told that they are, as at other times, for the most part boys, mestizos, and mulattoes, with some Indians (Native Americans). There is no little cause for regret in the great sums that reënforcements of such men waste for, and cost, your Majesty. I cannot see what betterment there will be until your Majesty shall provide it, since I do not think, that more can be done in Nueva Spaña, although the viceroy must be endeavoring to do so, as he is ordered.")</ref> The Muslim side though was also equally racially diverse. In addition to the native Malay warriors, the Ottomans had repeatedly sent military expeditions to nearby [[Ottoman expedition to Aceh|Aceh]]. The expeditions were composed mainly of [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Egyptians]], [[Swahili people|Swahilis]], [[Somalis]], [[Sindhis]], [[Gujaratis]] and [[Malabars]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=jtsMLNmMzbkC&pg=PA39 ''The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia'' by Nicholas Tarling p. 39]</ref> These expeditionary forces had also spread to other nearby Sultanates such as Brunei and had taught new fighting tactics and techniques on how to forge cannons.<ref>''Cambridge illustrated atlas, warfare: Renaissance to revolution, 1492–1792'' by Jeremy Black p. 16 [https://books.google.com/books?id=neUKEvaYPZYC&pg=PA16]</ref>  

Eventually, the Spanish invaded the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna. The Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to [[Jerudong]]. In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei. Suffering high fatalities due to a [[cholera]] or [[dysentery]] outbreak,<ref>{{Harvnb|Frankham|2008|p=278}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Atiyah|2002|p=71}}</ref> the Spanish decided to abandon Brunei and returned to Manila on 26 June 1578, after 72 days. Before doing so, they burned the mosque, a high structure with a five-tier roof.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|pp=54–60}}</ref>

Pengiran Seri Lela died in August or September 1578, probably from the same illness suffered by his Spanish allies. There was suspicion he could have been poisoned by the ruling sultan. Seri Lela's daughter, a Bruneian princess had left with the Spanish, she married a Christian [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]], named Agustín de Legazpi de Tondo.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|p=57}}</ref>

The local Brunei accounts<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 41">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=41}}</ref> differ greatly from the generally accepted view of events. What was called the Castilian War was seen as a heroic episode, with the Spaniards being driven out by Bendahara Sakam, purportedly a brother of the ruling sultan, and a thousand native warriors. Most historians consider this to be a [[folk-hero]] account, which probably developed decades or centuries after.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saunders|2002|pp=57–58}}</ref>

Brunei eventually descended into anarchy. The country suffered a [[Brunei Civil War|civil war]] from 1660 to 1673.

=== British intervention ===

[[File:Control of the island of Borneo.png|thumb|right|Boundaries of Brunei (green) since 1890.]]
The British have intervened in the affairs of Brunei on several occasions. Britain attacked Brunei in July 1846 due to internal conflicts over who was the rightful Sultan.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=52}}</ref>

In the 1880s, the decline of the [[Bruneian Empire]] continued. The sultan granted land (now Sarawak) to [[James Brooke]], who had helped him quell a rebellion and allowed him to establish the [[Kingdom of Sarawak]]. Over time, Brooke and his nephews (who succeeded him) leased or annexed more land. Brunei lost much of its territory to him and his dynasty, known as the [[White Rajahs]].

Sultan [[Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin]] appealed to the British to stop further encroachment by the Brookes.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=3}}</ref> The "Treaty of Protection" was negotiated by [[Sir Hugh Low]] and signed into effect on 17 September 1888. The treaty said that the sultan "could not cede or lease any territory to foreign powers without British consent"; it provided [[United Kingdom|Britain]] effective control over Brunei's external affairs, making it a [[British protected state]] (which continued until 1984).<ref name=cia /> But, when the Kingdom of Sarawak annexed Brunei's [[Limbang Division|Pandaruan District]] in 1890, the British did not take any action to stop it. They did not regard either Brunei or the Kingdom of Sarawak as 'foreign' (per the Treaty of Protection). This final annexation by Sarawak left Brunei with its current small land mass and separation into two parts.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=58}}</ref>

[[British resident]]s were introduced in Brunei under the Supplementary Protectorate Agreement in 1906.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 59">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=59}}</ref> The residents were to advise the sultan on all matters of administration. Over time, the resident assumed more executive control than the sultan. The residential system ended in 1959.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=67}}</ref>

Petroleum was discovered in 1929 after several fruitless attempts.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=12}}</ref> Two men, F. F. Marriot and T. G.

=== Japanese occupation ===

{{Main|Japanese occupation of British Borneo}}
[[File:Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin (AWM P10841.001).JPG|thumb|[[Ahmad Tajuddin]], the [[List of Sultans of Brunei|27th Sultan of Brunei]], with members of his court in April 1941, eight months before the Japanese invaded Brunei.]]
The Japanese invaded Brunei on 16 December 1941, eight days after their [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the United States Navy. They landed 10,000 troops of the [[Kawaguchi Detachment]] from [[Cam Ranh Bay]] at [[Kuala Belait]]. After six days fighting, they occupied the entire country. The only Allied troops in the area were the 2nd Battalion of the [[15th Punjab Regiment]] based at [[Kuching]], Sarawak.<ref>"Brunei under the Japanese occupation", Rozan Yunos, ''Brunei Times'', Bandar Seri Begawan, 29 June 2008</ref>

Once the Japanese occupied Brunei, they made an agreement with [[Ahmad Tajuddin|Sultan Ahmad Tajuddin]] over governing the country. Inche Ibrahim (known later as Pehin Datu Perdana Menteri Dato Laila Utama Awang Haji Ibrahim), a former Secretary to the British Resident, Ernest Edgar Pengilly, was appointed [[Chief Administrative Officer]] under the Japanese Governor. The Japanese had proposed that Pengilly retain his position under their administration, but he declined. Both he and other British nationals still in Brunei were interned by the Japanese at [[Batu Lintang camp]] in Sarawak. While the British officials were under Japanese guard, Ibrahim made a point of personally shaking each one by the hand and wishing him well.<ref>"The Japanese Interregnum...," Graham Saunders, ''A history of Brunei'', Edition 2, illustrated, reprint, Routledge, 2002, p. 129, {{ISBN|070071698X|978-0700716982}}</ref>

The Sultan retained his throne and was given a pension and honours by the Japanese. During the later part of the occupation, he resided at Tantuya, [[Limbang]] and had little to do with the Japanese. Most of the Malay government officers were retained by the Japanese. Brunei's administration was reorganised into five prefectures, which included British [[North Borneo]]. The Prefectures included [[Miri Division|Baram]], [[Labuan]], [[Lawas]], and [[Limbang]]. Ibrahim hid numerous significant government documents from the Japanese during the occupation. Pengiran Yusuf (later YAM Pengiran Setia Negara Pengiran [[Haji Mohd Yusuf]]), along with other Bruneians, was sent to Japan for training. Although in the area the day of the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], Yusuf survived.

[[File:Japanese battleships at Brunei, Borneo, in October 1944 (NH 73090).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|Japanese battleships at Brunei in October 1944.]]
The British had anticipated a Japanese attack, but lacked the resources to defend the area because of their engagement in the war in Europe. The troops from the Punjab Regiment filled in the [[Seria]] oilfield oilwells with concrete in September 1941 to deny the Japanese their use. The remaining equipment and installations were destroyed when the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Japanese invaded Malaya]]. By the end of the war, 16 wells at [[Miri, Malaysia|Miri]] and Seria had been restarted, with production reaching about half the pre-war level. Coal production at [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] was also recommenced, but with little success.
[[File:Japanese Surrender, Labuan (AWM 115989).JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.15|[[George Wootten|Major-General Wootten]] of the Australian 9th Division with [[Masao Baba|Lieutenant-General Masao Baba]] (signing) of the Japanese 37th Division at the surrender ceremony at Labuan on 10 September 1945.]]

During the occupation, the Japanese had their language taught in schools, and Government officers were required to learn Japanese. The local currency was replaced by what was to become known as [[Banana money|''duit pisang'' (banana money)]]. From 1943 hyper-inflation destroyed the currency's value and, at the end of the war, this currency was worthless. Allied attacks on shipping eventually caused trade to cease. Food and medicine fell into short supply, and the population suffered famine and disease.

The [[Brunei International Airport|airport]] runway was constructed by the Japanese during the occupation, and in 1943 Japanese naval units were based in [[Brunei Bay]] and Labuan. The naval base was destroyed by Allied bombing, but the airport runway survived. The facility was developed as a public airport. In 1944 the Allies began a bombing campaign against the occupying Japanese, which destroyed much of the town and Kuala Belait, but missed [[Kampong Ayer]].<ref>"Japanese occupation", ''Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam'', Jatswan S. Sidhu, Edition 2, illustrated, Scarecrow Press, 2009, p. 115, {{ISBN|0810870789|978-0810870789}}</ref>

On 10 June 1945, the [[Australian 9th Division]] landed at Muara under [[Battle of North Borneo|Operation Oboe Six]] to recapture Borneo from the Japanese. They were supported by American air and naval units. Brunei town was bombed extensively and recaptured after three days of heavy fighting. Many buildings were destroyed, including the Mosque. The Japanese forces in Brunei, Borneo, and Sarawak, under Lieutenant-General Masao Baba, formally surrendered at Labuan on 10 September 1945. The British Military Administration took over from the Japanese and remained until July 1946.

=== Post-World War II ===
After [[World War II]], a new government was formed in Brunei under the [[British Military Administration (Borneo)|British Military Administration]] (BMA). It consisted mainly of Australian officers and servicemen.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=79}}</ref> The administration of Brunei was passed to the Civil Administration on 6 July 1945. The Brunei State Council was also revived that year.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 80">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=80}}</ref> The BMA was tasked to revive the Bruneian economy, which was extensively damaged by the Japanese during their occupation. They also had to put out the fires on the wells of Seria, which had been set by the Japanese prior to their defeat.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 80" />

Before 1941, the Governor of the Straits Settlements, based in Singapore, was responsible for the duties of British High Commissioner for Brunei, [[Kingdom of Sarawak|Sarawak]], and [[North Borneo]] (now [[Sabah]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=81}}</ref> The first [[British High Commissioner]] for Brunei was the Governor of Sarawak, Sir Charles Ardon Clarke.
The Barisan Pemuda ("Youth Movement") (abbreviated as BARIP) was the first political party to be formed in Brunei, on 12 April 1946. The party intended to "preserve the sovereignty of the Sultan and the country, and to defend the rights of the [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]]".<ref name="History131">{{cite book|last=A History of Brunei|title=A History of Brunei|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1698-X|page=131|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SQ4t_OJgSjAC&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> BARIP also contributed to the composition of the country's national anthem. The party was dissolved in 1948 due to inactivity.

In 1959, a new constitution was written declaring Brunei a self-governing state, while its foreign affairs, security, and defence remained the responsibility of the United Kingdom.<ref name="US DOS" /> A small [[rebellion]] erupted against the monarchy in 1962, which was suppressed with help of the UK. Known as the [[Brunei Revolt]], it contributed to the failure to create the [[North Borneo Federation]]. The rebellion partially affected Brunei's decision to opt out of the Malaysian Federation.<ref name="US DOS" />

Brunei gained its independence from the United Kingdom on 1 January 1984.<ref name="US DOS" /> The official National Day, which celebrates the country's independence, is held by tradition on 23 February.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.lonelyplanet.com/brunei-darussalam/events/brunei-national-day/a/poi-fes/1152687/355846 | title = Brunei National Day | work = Lonely Planet | accessdate = 21 February 2017 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170222054402/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/brunei-darussalam/events/brunei-national-day/a/poi-fes/1152687/355846 | archivedate = 22 February 2017 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

=== Writing of the Constitution ===
[[File:Omar Ali Saifuddien III.jpg|thumb|200px|Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]]]]
In July 1953, Sultan [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]] formed a seven-member committee named ''Tujuh Serangkai'', to find out the citizens' views regarding a written constitution for Brunei. In May 1954, the Sultan, Resident and High Commissioner met to discuss the findings of the committee. They agreed to authorise the drafting of a constitution. In March 1959 Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III led a delegation to London to discuss the proposed Constitution.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=98}}</ref> The British delegation was led by Sir [[Alan Lennox-Boyd]], Secretary of State for the Colonies. The British Government later accepted the draft constitution.

On 29 September 1959, the Constitution Agreement was signed in [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]. The agreement was signed by Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddien III and Sir Robert Scott, the Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia.
It included the following provisions:<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 59" />
* The Sultan was made the Supreme Head of State.
* Brunei was responsible for its internal administration.
* The British Government was responsible for foreign and defence affairs only.
* The post of Resident was abolished and replaced by a British High Commissioner.

Five councils were set up:<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=100}}</ref>
* The Executive Council
* [[Legislative Council of Brunei|The Legislative Council of Brunei]]
* The Privy Council
* The Council of Succession
* The State Religious Council

=== National development plans ===
A series of National Development Plans was initiated by the 28th Sultan of Brunei, [[Omar Ali Saifuddien III]].

The first was introduced in 1953.<ref>{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=92}}</ref> A total sum of B$100 million was approved by the Brunei State Council for the plan. E.R. Bevington, from the Colonial Office in [[Fiji]], was appointed to implement it.<ref name="History Page 129">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=129}}</ref> A $US14 million Gas Plant was built under the plan. In 1954, survey and exploration work were undertaken by the Brunei Shell Petroleum on both offshore and onshore fields. By 1956, production reached 114,700 [[barrels per day|bpd]].

[[File:THE BRITISH ARMY IN BRUNEI, JANUARY 1963.jpg|thumb|British soldiers in the [[British protectorate]] of Brunei on guard in the [[Seria Field|Seria oilfield]], January 1963]]
The plan also aided the development of public education. By 1958, expenditure on education totalled at $4 million.<ref name="History Page 129" /> Communications were improved, as new roads were built and reconstruction at Berakas Airport was completed in 1954.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 21">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=21}}</ref>

The second National Development Plan was launched in 1962.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 21" /> A major oil and gas field was discovered in 1963, with this discovery, [[Liquefied Natural Gas]] became important. Developments in the oil and gas sector have continued, and oil production has steadily increased since then.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 96">{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=96}}</ref> The plan also promoted the production of meat and eggs for consumption by citizens. The fishing industry increased its output by 25% throughout the course of the plan. The [[List of Panamax ports|deepwater port]] at [[Muara, Brunei|Muara]] was also constructed during this period. Power requirements were met, and studies were made to provide electricity to rural areas.<ref name="History for Brunei 2009 96" /> Efforts were made to eradicate [[malaria]], an endemic disease in the region, with the help of the [[World Health Organization]]. Malaria cases were reduced from 300 cases in 1953 to only 66 cases in 1959.<ref name="History129">{{cite book|last=A History of Brunei|title=A History of Brunei|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-7007-1698-X|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SQ4t_OJgSjAC&printsec=frontcover|accessdate=14 October 2013}}</ref> The death rate was reduced from 20 per thousand in 1947 to 11.3 per thousand in 1953.<ref name="History129" /> Infectious disease has been prevented by public sanitation and improvement of drainage, and the provision of piped pure water to the population.<ref name="History129" />

=== Independence ===
On 14 November 1971, Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] left for London to discuss matters regarding the amendments to the 1959 constitution. A new agreement was signed on 23 November 1971 with the British representative being [[Anthony Royle, Baron Fanshawe of Richmond|Anthony Royle]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ministry of Education, Brunei|first=|title=History for Brunei Darussalam|year=2008|publisher=EBP Pan Pacific|isbn=9991725458|page=101|chapter=The Nation Building Years 150–1984}}</ref>

Under this agreement, the following terms were agreed upon:
* Brunei was granted full internal self-government
* The UK would still be responsible for external affairs and defence.
* Brunei and the UK agreed to share the responsibility for security and defence.

This agreement also caused [[British Military Garrison Brunei|Gurkha units]] to be deployed in Brunei, where they remain up to this day.

[[File:Sultan of Brunei with Janin Erih.jpg|thumb|Sultan [[Hassanal Bolkiah]] (right) in 2004]]
On 7 January 1979, another treaty was signed between Brunei and the [[United Kingdom]]. It was signed with Lord Goronwy-Roberts being the representative of the UK. This agreement granted Brunei to take over international responsibilities as an independent nation. Britain agreed to assist Brunei in diplomatic matters.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ministry of Education, Brunei|first=|title=History for Brunei Darussalam|year=2008|publisher=EBP Pan Pacific|isbn=9991725458|page=102|chapter=The Nation Building Years 150–1984}}</ref> In May 1983, it was announced by the UK that the date of independence of Brunei would be 1 January 1984.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

On 31 December 1983, a mass gathering was held on main mosques on all four of the districts of the country and at midnight, on 1 January 1984, the Proclamation of Independence was read by Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah. The sultan subsequently assumed the title "[[Majesty|His Majesty]]", rather than the previous "[[His Royal Highness]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bt.com.bn/home_news/2009/01/01/reminiscing_bruneis_independence_proclamation|title=Reminiscing Brunei's independence proclamation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Brunei Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321195012/http://bt.com.bn/home_news/2009/01/01/reminiscing_bruneis_independence_proclamation|archive-date=21 March 2016|accessdate=20 November 2013}}</ref> Brunei was [[Member states of the United Nations|admitted to the United Nations]] on 22 September 1984, becoming the organisation's 159th member.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/22/world/brunei-is-greeted-as-the-159th-un-member.html Brunei is Greeted as the 159th U.N.

The national [[flag carrier|air carrier]], [[Royal Brunei Airlines]], is trying to develop Brunei as a modest hub for international travel between Europe and Australia/New Zealand. Central to this strategy is the position that the airline maintains at London Heathrow Airport.

The airline also has services to major Asian destinations including Shanghai, Bangkok, Singapore and Manila.

[[Islam in Brunei|Islam]] is the official religion of Brunei,<ref name=cia /> specifically that of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] branch, as dictated by the Madhhab of [[Shafi‘i]]. Two-thirds of the population, including the majority of [[Bruneian Malay people|Bruneian Malays]] adhere to Islam. Other faiths practised are [[Buddhism in Brunei|Buddhism]] (13%, mainly by the Chinese) and [[Christianity in Brunei|Christianity]] (10%).<ref name=cia />  [[Freethought|Freethinkers]], mostly Chinese, form about 7% of the population. Although most of them practise some form of religion with elements of Buddhism, [[Confucianism]], and [[Taoism]], they prefer to present themselves as having practised no religion officially, hence labelled as [[atheism|atheists]] in official censuses. Followers of indigenous religions are about 2% of the population.<ref>{{cite book|title=2010 Brunei Statistical Yearbook|year=2010|publisher=Brunei Government|page=19|url=http://www.depd.gov.bn/SI/BDSYB2010/BDSYB%202010.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307205335/http://www.depd.gov.bn/SI/BDSYB2010/BDSYB%202010.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-03-07}}</ref>

=== Languages ===
{{Main|Languages of Brunei}}
The official language of Brunei is [[Malay language|Standard Malay]], for which both the [[Latin alphabet]] and the [[Arabic alphabet]] are used. The local dialect, [[Melayu Brunei]] (Brunei Malay), is the most widely spoken language.

[[English Language|English]] is widely used as a business and official language and it is spoken by a majority of the [[Demographics of Brunei|population in Brunei]].

The [[Ethnic Chinese in Brunei|Chinese minority]] in Brunei speak a number of [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]].

[[Arabic language|Arabic]] (عربي) is the religious language of [[Muslim]]s. Therefore, Arabic is taught in schools, particularly religious schools, and also in institutes of higher learning. As of 2004, there are six Arabic schools and one religious teachers' college in Brunei. A majority of Brunei's Muslim population has had some form of formal or informal education in the reading, writing and pronunciation of the [[Arabic language]] as part of their religious education.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Brunei}}
[[File:Royal Regalie (1).JPG|thumb|right|Royal Regalia Museum]]
The culture of Brunei is predominantly [[Malay people|Malay]] (reflecting its ethnicity), with heavy influences from [[Islam]], but is seen as much more conservative than [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]].<ref>For a discussion of religious freedom, see [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2006/71334.htm Brunei]. International Religious Freedom Report 2006, United States Department of State.</ref> Influences to Bruneian culture come from the Malay cultures of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. Four periods of cultural influence have occurred, animist, [[Hindu]], Islamic, and Western. Islam had a very strong influence, and was adopted as Brunei's ideology and philosophy. Brunei's official main language is [[Malay language|Malay]] but English is also widely spoken as it is a compulsory subject in the majority of the schools.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110511082403/http://www.jpm.gov.bn/pmo1/index.php?view=article&id=185%3Alanguage-and-culture&format=pdf&option=com_content&Itemid=209 Language and Culture]. jpm.gov.bn (28 May 2009)</ref>

=== Media ===
{{Main|Media of Brunei}}
Media in Brunei are said to be ''pro-government''. The country has been given "Not Free" status by [[Freedom House]]; press criticism of the government and monarchy is rare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/pfs/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=6929&year=2007&pf|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080511080900/http://www.freedomhouse.org/inc/content/pubs/pfs/inc_country_detail.cfm?country=6929&year=2007&pf|archivedate=11 May 2008|title=Freedom of the Press – Brunei (2006) |publisher=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=30 December 2009}}</ref> Nonetheless, the press is not overtly hostile toward alternative viewpoints and is not restricted to publishing only articles regarding the government. The government allowed a printing and publishing company, Brunei Press PLC, to form in 1953. The company continues to print the English daily ''[[Borneo Bulletin]]''. This paper began as a weekly community paper and became a daily in 1990<ref name="bruneipress.com.bn">{{cite web |url=http://www.bruneipress.com.bn/brunei/brunei.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020623025316/http://www.bruneipress.com.bn/brunei/brunei.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 June 2002 |title=About Brunei |publisher=Bruneipress.com.bn |date=30 July 1998 |accessdate=23 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Apart from The ''Borneo Bulletin'', there is also the ''[[Media Permata]]'' and Pelita Brunei, the local Malay newspapers which are circulated daily. ''[[The Brunei Times]]'' is another English independent newspaper published in Brunei since 2006.<ref>{{cite web|title=Brunei Times Website|url=http://bt.com.bn/|accessdate=15 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213020954/http://www.bt.com.bn/|archivedate=13 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Brunei government owns and operates six television channels with the introduction of digital TV using DVB-T (RTB 1, RTB 2, RTB 3 (HD), RTB 4, RTB 5 and RTB New Media (Game portal)) and five radio stations (National FM, Pilihan FM, Nur Islam FM, Harmony FM and Pelangi FM). A private company has made cable television available (Astro-Kristal) as well as one private radio station, Kristal FM.<ref name="bruneipress.com.bn" />
It also has an online campus radio station, ''[[UBD FM]]'' that streams from its first university, [[Universiti Brunei Darussalam]].<ref>{{cite web|last=UBD Radio Website|title=UBD Radio|url=http://www.ubdfm.blogspot.com/|accessdate=23 December 2011}}</ref>

===Sport===
The most popular sport in Brunei is [[association football]]. The [[Brunei national football team]] joined [[FIFA]] in 1969, but has not had much success. The top two football leagues are the [[Brunei Super League]] and the [[Brunei Premier League]].

Brunei debuted [[Brunei at the Olympics|at the Olympics]] in 1996; it has competed at all subsequent [[Summer Olympics]] except 2008. The country has competed in badminton, shooting, swimming, and track-and-field, but is yet to win any medals. Brunei has had slightly more success [[Brunei at the Asian Games|at the Asian Games]], winning four bronze medals. The first major international sporting event to be hosted in Brunei was the [[1999 Southeast Asian Games]]. According to the [[all-time Southeast Asian Games medal table]], Bruneian athletes have won a total of 11 gold medals at the games; only [[East Timor]] has won fewer.

== Legal system ==
Brunei has numerous courts in its judicial branch. The highest court is the Supreme Court, which consists of the Court of Appeal and High Court. Both of these have a chief justice and two judges.<ref name=cia />

=== Women and children ===

The U.S. Department of State has stated that discrimination against women is a problem in Brunei.<ref name="state.gov">[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eap/154379.htm 2010 Human Rights Report: Brunei Darussalam]. US Department of State</ref> The law prohibits sexual harassment and stipulates that whoever assaults or uses criminal force, intending thereby to outrage or knowing it is likely to outrage the modesty of a person, shall be punished with imprisonment for as much as five years and [[caning]]. The law stipulates imprisonment of up to 30 years, and caning with not fewer than 12 strokes for rape. The law does not criminalise spousal rape; it explicitly states that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife, as long as she is not under 13 years of age, is not rape. Protections against sexual assault by a spouse are provided under the amended Islamic Family Law Order 2010 and Married Women Act Order 2010. The penalty for breaching a protection order is a fine not exceeding BN$2,000 ($1,538) or imprisonment not exceeding six months.

Citizenship is derived through one's parents rather than through birth within the country's territory. Parents with stateless status are required to apply for a special pass for a child born in the country; failure to register a child may make it difficult to enroll the child in school. By law, sexual intercourse with a female under 14 years of age constitutes rape and is punishable by imprisonment for not less than eight years and not more than 30 years and not less than 12 strokes of the cane. The intent of the law is to protect girls from exploitation through prostitution and "other immoral purposes", including pornography.<ref name="state.gov" />

=== Human rights ===
{{Main|Freedom of religion in Brunei|LGBT rights in Brunei}}
Brunei's revised penal code came into force on 22 April 2014, stipulating the [[death penalty]] for numerous offenses (both violent and non-violent), such as insult or defamation of [[Muhammad]], insulting any verses of the Quran and Hadith, [[blasphemy]], declaring oneself a prophet or non-Muslim, robbery, rape, adultery, sodomy, extramarital sexual relations for Muslims, and murder. Stoning to death was the specified "method of execution for crimes of a sexual nature". Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the Office of the [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) declared that, "Application of the death penalty for such a broad range of offences contravenes international law."<ref name="UN_2014">{{citation |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=47552 |title=UN concerned at broad application of death penalty in Brunei’s revised penal code |date=11 April 2014 |accessdate=5 August 2015 }}</ref>

Male and female [[homosexuality]] is [[LGBT rights in Brunei|illegal in Brunei]].

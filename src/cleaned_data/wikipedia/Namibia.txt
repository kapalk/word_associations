Its western border is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; it shares land borders with [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]] to the north, [[Botswana]] to the east and [[South Africa]] to the south and east. Although [[Kazungula|it does not]] border [[Zimbabwe]], less than 200 metres of the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the [[Namibian War of Independence]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Windhoek]], and it is a member state of the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[African Union]] (AU), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Namibia, the driest country in Sub-Saharan Africa,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/23/world/africa/namibia-eye-on-country-profile/index.html |title=Namibia country profile: moving on from a difficult past |author=Peter Shadbolt |website=CNN |date=24 October 2012}}</ref> was inhabited since early times by the [[San people|San]], [[Damara people|Damara]], and [[Nama people]]s. Around the 14th century, [[immigrating]] [[Bantu peoples]] arrived as part of the [[Bantu expansion]]. Since then, the Bantu groups, one of which is known as the [[Ovambo people]], have dominated the population of the country; since the late 19th century, they have constituted a majority.

In 1878, the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], then a British colony, had annexed the port of [[Walvis Bay]] and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of South Africa]] at its creation in 1910. In 1884 the [[German Empire]] established rule over most of the territory as a protectorate (''Schutzgebiet''). It began to develop infrastructure and farming and maintained this German colony until 1915, when South African forces defeated its military. In 1920, after the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] mandated the country to the United Kingdom, under administration by South Africa. It imposed its laws, including racial classifications and rules.

From 1948, with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] elected to power, South Africa applied [[apartheid]] also to what was then known as [[South West Africa]].

In the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation by native African political activists seeking independence resulted in the UN assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but South Africa maintained ''de facto'' rule. In 1973 the UN recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation ([[SWAPO]]) as the official representative of the Namibian people; the party is dominated by the Ovambo, who are a large plurality in the territory. Following continued guerrilla warfare, South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985. Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990. However, [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]] remained under South African control until 1994.

Namibia has a population of 2.6&nbsp;million people and a stable [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[parliamentary democracy]]. Agriculture, [[herding]], [[Tourism in Namibia|tourism]] and the [[Mineral industry of Namibia|mining industry]]&nbsp;– including mining for gem diamonds, [[Uranium mining|uranium]], [[Gold mining|gold]], [[Silver mining|silver]], and [[base metal]]s&nbsp;– form the basis of its [[Economy of Namibia|economy]]. The large, arid [[Namib Desert]] has resulted in Namibia being overall one of the [[List of countries and territories by population density|least densely populated]] countries in the world.

==Etymology==
The name of the country is derived from the [[Namib Desert]], considered to be the oldest desert in the world.<ref name=at1315>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Africa: Namibia|id=at1315}}</ref> The name, ''Namib'' itself, is of [[nama language|Nama]] origin and means "vast place". Before its independence in 1990, the area was known first as [[German South-West Africa]] (''Deutsch-Südwestafrika''), then as South-West Africa, reflecting the colonial occupation by the Germans and the South Africans (technically on behalf of the British crown reflecting South Africa's dominion status within the British Empire).

==History==
{{Main|History of Namibia}}

===Pre-colonial period===
[[File:Buschmannkinder.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] are Namibia's oldest [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] inhabitants.]]
The dry lands of Namibia have been inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Nama. Around the 14th century, immigrating [[Bantu people]] began to arrive during the [[Bantu expansion]] from central Africa.

From the late 18th century onward, [[Oorlam people]] from Cape Colony crossed the [[Orange River]] and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia.<ref name="KDA">{{cite web |url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015021238/http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm |archivedate=15 October 2008 |last=Dierks |first=Klaus |authorlink=Klaus Dierks |title=Biographies of Namibian Personalities, A |accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref> Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful. They received the missionaries accompanying the Oorlam very well,<ref name="Dierks">{{cite web |last=Dierks |first=Klaus |authorlink=Klaus Dierks |title=Warmbad becomes two hundred years |url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Warm_Bath/index.htm |website=Klausdierks.com |accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref> granting them the right to use waterholes and grazing against an annual payment.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=177}} On their way further northwards, however, the Oorlam encountered clans of the [[Herero people|Herero]] at Windhoek, [[Gobabis]], and [[Okahandja]], who resisted their encroachment. The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[German Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=659}}

The first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo Cão]] in 1485 and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486, but the Portuguese crown did not try to claim the area. Like most of interior [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from Germany and Sweden. In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]]kers crossed the area on their way from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to [[Angola]]. Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey.

===German rule===
{{see also|German South West Africa|Herero and Namaqua genocide}}
[[File:Kirche denkmal nam.jpg|thumb|German church and monument to colonists in Windhoek, Namibia.]]
Namibia became a German colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-Südwestafrika'').<ref>{{cite web|title=German South West Africa|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> However, the [[Palgrave Commission]] by the British governor in Cape Town had determined that only the natural deep-water harbor of [[Walvis Bay]] was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa.

From 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] [[Herero Wars|took up arms]] against brutal German colonialism. In calculated punitive action by the German occupiers, government officials ordered extinction of the natives in the [[Herero and Namaqua genocide]] In what has been called the "first genocide of the Twentieth Century",<ref>{{cite web |author=[[David Olusoga]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/18/pope-francis-armenian-genocide-first-20th-century-namibia |title=Dear Pope Francis, Namibia was the 20th century's first genocide |work=The Guardian |date=18 April 2015 |accessdate=26 November 2015}}</ref> the Germans systematically killed 10,000 Nama (half the population) and approximately 65,000 Herero (about 80% of the population).<ref>Drechsler, Horst (1980). The actual number of deaths in the limited number of battles with the Germany Schutztruppe (expeditionary force) were limited; most of the deaths occurred after fighting had ended. The German military governor [[Lothar von Trotha]] issued an explicit extermination order, and many Herero died of disease and abuse in detention camps after being taken from their land. A substantial minority of Herero crossed the Kalahari desert into the British colony of Bechuanaland (modern-day [[Botswana]]), where a small community continues to live in western Botswana near to border with Namibia. ''Let us die fighting'', originally published (1966) under the title ''Südwestafrika unter deutsche Kolonialherrschaft''. Berlin: Akademie-Verlag.</ref><ref name=Adhikari/> The survivors, when finally released from detention, were subjected to a policy of dispossession, deportation, forced labor, racial segregation, and discrimination in a system that in many ways anticipated the [[apartheid]] established by South Africa in 1948.

Most Africans were confined to so-called native territories, which later under South African rule after 1949 were turned into "homelands" ([[Bantustans]]). Indeed, some historians have speculated that the German genocide in Namibia was a model used by [[Nazism|Nazi]]s in [[the Holocaust]].<ref name=Madley/> The memory of genocide remains relevant to ethnic identity in independent Namibia and to relations with Germany.<ref>Reinhart Kössler and Henning Melber, "Völkermord und Gedenken: Der Genozid an den Herero und Nama in Deutsch-Südwestafrika 1904–1908," ("Genocide and memory: the genocide of the Herero and Nama in German South-West Africa, 1904–08") ''Jahrbuch zur Geschichte und Wirkung des Holocaust'' 2004: 37–75</ref> The German government formally apologized for the Namibian genocide in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |author=Andrew Meldrum |title=German minister says sorry for genocide in Namibia |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/aug/16/germany.andrewmeldrum |work=The Guardian |date=15 August 2004 |accessdate=26 October 2018}}</ref>

===South African mandate===
{{see also|South West Africa}}

During World War I, South African troops under General [[Louis Botha]] [[South West Africa campaign|occupied the territory]] and deposed the German colonial administration. The end of the war and the [[Treaty of Versailles]] left South Africa in possession of South West Africa as a [[League of Nations mandate]].<ref name=Rajagopal>{{cite book|last=Rajagopal|first=Balakrishnan|title=International Law from Below: Development, Social Movements and Third World Resistance|year=2003|pages=50–68|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521016711}}</ref> The mandate system was formed as a compromise between those who advocated for an Allied annexation of former German and Turkish territories, and another proposition put forward by those who wished to grant them to an international trusteeship until they could govern themselves.<ref name=Rajagopal/> It permitted the South African government to administer South West Africa for an undefined period until that territory's inhabitants were prepared for political self-determination.<ref name=Louis>{{cite book|last=Louis|first=William Roger|title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization|year=2006|pages=251–261|publisher=I.B. Tauris & Company, Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1845113476}}</ref> However, South Africa interpreted the mandate as a veiled annexation and made no attempt to prepare South West Africa for future autonomy.<ref name=Louis/>

As a result of the [[United Nations Conference on International Organization|Conference on International Organization]] in 1945, the League of Nations was formally superseded by the [[United Nations]] (UN) and former League mandates by a trusteeship system. Article 77 of the [[United Nations Charter]] stated that UN trusteeship "shall apply...to territories now held under mandate"; furthermore, it would "be a matter of subsequent agreement as to which territories in the foregoing territories will be brought under the trusteeship system and under what terms".<ref name=Vandenbosch>{{cite book|last=Vandenbosch|first=Amry|title=South Africa and the World: The Foreign Policy of Apartheid|year=1970|pages=207–224|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington|isbn=978-0813164946}}</ref> The UN requested all former League of Nations mandates be surrendered to its [[United Nations Trusteeship Council|Trusteeship Council]] in anticipation of their independence.<ref name=Vandenbosch/> South Africa declined to do so and instead requested permission from the UN to formally annex South West Africa, for which it received considerable criticism.<ref name=Vandenbosch/> When the UN General Assembly rejected this proposal, South Africa dismissed its opinion as irrelevant and began solidifying control of the territory.<ref name=Vandenbosch/> The UN responded by deferring to the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), which held a number of discussions on the legality of South African rule between 1949 and 1966.<ref name=First>{{cite book|last=First|first=Ruth|editor1-last=Segal|editor1-first=Ronald|title=South West Africa|year=1963|pages=169–193|publisher=Penguin Books, Incorporated|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0844620619}}</ref>

South Africa began imposing ''[[apartheid]],'' its codified system of racial segregation and discrimination, on South West Africa during the late 1940s.<ref name=Crawford1>{{cite book|last=Crawford|first=Neta|title=Argument and Change in World Politics: Ethics, Decolonization, and Humanitarian Intervention|year=2002|pages=333–336|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521002790}}</ref> Black South West Africans were subject to [[pass laws]], curfews, and a host of draconian residential regulations that heavily restricted their movement. Development was concentrated in the region of the country immediately adjacent to South Africa, formally denoted as the "Police Zone", where most of the German colonial era settlements and mines were also located. Outside the Police Zone, indigenous peoples were restricted to theoretically self-governing [[Bantustan|tribal homelands]].<ref name="Devils">{{cite book|title=The Devils Are Among Us: The War for Namibia|last1=Herbstein|first1=Denis|last2=Evenson|first2=John|publisher=Zed Books Ltd|year=1989|isbn=978-0862328962|location=London|pages=14–23}}</ref>

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, pressure for global decolonisation and national self-determination began mounting on the African continent; these factors had a radical impact on South West African nationalism. Early nationalist organisations such as the [[South West African National Union]] (SWANU) and [[South West African People's Organisation]] (SWAPO) made determined attempts to establish indigenous political structures for an independent South West Africa.<ref name="Müller">{{cite book|last=Müller|first=Johann Alexander|title=The Inevitable Pipeline Into Exile.

By the end of the eleven month transition period, the last South African troops had been withdrawn from Namibia, all political prisoners granted amnesty, racially discriminatory legislation repealed, and 42,000 Namibian refugees returned to their homes.

The Namibian Constitution adopted in February 1990 incorporated protection for human rights, compensation for state expropriations of private property, and established an independent judiciary, legislature, and an executive presidency (the constituent assembly became the national assembly). The country officially became independent on 21 March 1990.

===After independence===
Since independence Namibia has completed the transition from white minority apartheid rule to parliamentary democracy. [[Multiparty democracy]] was introduced and has been maintained, with local, regional and [[Elections in Namibia|national elections]] held regularly. Several registered political parties are active and represented in the National Assembly, although the [[SWAPO]] has won every election since independence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Country report: Spotlight on Namibia |publisher=[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] Secretariat |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/34580/34581/224187/250510spotlightonnamibia.htm |date=25 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705012456/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/news/34580/34581/224187/250510spotlightonnamibia.htm |archivedate=5 July 2010 }}</ref> The transition from the 15-year rule of President [[Sam Nujoma]] to his successor [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] in 2005 went smoothly.<ref name="IRIN">{{cite news |title=IRIN country profile Namibia |agency=[[IRIN]] |url=http://www.irinnews.org/country.aspx?CountryCode=NA&RegionCode=SAF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217173041/http://www.irinnews.org/country.aspx?CountryCode=NA&RegionCode=SAF |archivedate=17 February 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2010|date=March 2007}}</ref>

Since independence, the Namibian government has promoted a policy of national reconciliation. It issued an amnesty for those who had fought on either side during the liberation war. The civil war in Angola spilled over and adversely affected Namibians living in the north of the country. In 1998, [[Namibia Defence Force]] (NDF) troops were sent to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] as part of a [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) contingent.

In 1999, the national government quashed a secessionist attempt in the northeastern [[Caprivi Strip]].<ref name="IRIN"/> The [[Caprivi conflict]] was initiated by the [[Caprivi Liberation Army]] (CLA), a [[Rebellion|rebel]] group led by [[Mishake Muyongo]]. It wanted the Caprivi Strip to secede in order to form its own society.

It lies mostly between latitudes [[17th parallel south|17°]] and [[29th parallel south|29°S]] (a small area is north of 17°), and longitudes [[11th meridian east|11°]] and [[26th meridian east|26°E]].

Being situated between the [[Namib]] and the [[Kalahari Desert|Kalahari]] deserts, Namibia has the least rainfall of any country in sub-Saharan Africa.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Land degradation causes poverty |last=Brandt |first=Edgar |newspaper=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]] |date=21 September 2012 |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201209211357.html}}</ref>

The Namibian landscape consists generally of five geographical areas, each with characteristic [[Abiotic component|abiotic conditions]] and vegetation, with some variation within and overlap between them: the Central Plateau, the Namib, the [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|Great Escarpment]], the [[Bushveld]], and the [[Kalahari Desert]].

The Central Plateau runs from north to south, bordered by the [[Skeleton Coast]] to the northwest, the Namib Desert and its coastal plains to the southwest, the [[Orange River]] to the south, and the Kalahari Desert to the east. The Central Plateau is home to the highest point in Namibia at [[Königstein, Namibia|Königstein]] elevation {{convert|2606|m|ft|0}}.<ref name="elevation">{{cite web |url=http://landsat.usgs.gov/gallery/detail/367/ |title=Landsat.usgs.gov |publisher=Landsat.usgs.gov |accessdate=26 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907062948/http://landsat.usgs.gov/gallery/detail/367/ |archivedate=7 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The Namib is a broad expanse of hyper-arid gravel plains and dunes that stretches along Namibia's entire coastline. It varies between 100 and many hundreds of kilometres in width. Areas within the Namib include the Skeleton Coast and the [[Kaokoveld]] in the north and the extensive Namib Sand Sea along the central coast.<ref name=at1315/>

The Great Escarpment swiftly rises to over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0}}. Average temperatures and temperature ranges increase further inland from the cold [[Atlantic]] waters, while the lingering coastal fogs slowly diminish. Although the area is rocky with poorly developed soils, it is significantly more productive than the Namib Desert. As summer winds are forced over the Escarpment, moisture is extracted as precipitation.<ref>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Africa: Namibia|id=at1316}}</ref>

The Bushveld is found in north-eastern Namibia along the Angolan border and in the [[Caprivi Strip]]. The area receives a significantly greater amount of precipitation than the rest of the country, averaging around {{convert|400|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year. The area is generally flat and the soils sandy, limiting their ability to retain water and support agriculture.<ref name="Cowling, S. 2001">Cowling, S. 2001. {{WWF ecoregion|id=at1322|name=Succulent Karoo}}</ref>

The [[Kalahari Desert]], an arid region that extends into South Africa and Botswana, is one of Namibia's well-known geographical features. The Kalahari, while popularly known as a desert, has a variety of localised environments, including some verdant and technically non-desert areas. The [[Succulent Karoo]] is home to over 5,000 species of plants, nearly half of them endemic; approximately 10 percent of the world's [[succulents]] are found in the Karoo.<ref>van Jaarsveld 1987, Smith et al 1993</ref> The reason behind this high productivity and endemism may be the relatively stable nature of precipitation.<ref>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Southern Africa: including parts of Botswana, northeastern Namibia, Zimbabwe, and northern South Africa |id=at0709}}</ref>

Namibia's Coastal Desert is one of the oldest deserts in the world.

===Climate===
[[File:Namibia-1113.jpg|thumb|Namibia is primarily a large desert and semi-desert plateau.]]
Namibia extends from 17°S to 25°S latitude: climatically the range of the sub-Tropical High Pressure Belt. Its overall climate description is arid, descending from the Sub-Humid [mean rain above {{cvt|500|mm|in|0}}] through Semi-Arid [between {{cvt|300 and 500|mm|in|0}}] (embracing most of the waterless Kalahari) and Arid [from {{cvt|150 to 300|mm|in|0}}] (these three regions are inland from the western [[Great Escarpment, Southern Africa|escarpment]]) to the Hyper-Arid coastal plain [less than {{cvt|100|mm|in|0}}]. Temperature maxima are limited by the overall elevation of the entire region: only in the far south, [[Warmbad, Namibia|Warmbad]] for instance, are mid-{{cvt|40|C|F|-1}} maxima recorded.<ref>"Paper and digital Climate Section". Namibia Meteorological Services</ref>

Typically the sub-Tropical High Pressure Belt, with frequent clear skies, provides more than 300 days of sunshine per year. It is situated at the southern edge of the tropics; the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] cuts the country about in half. The winter (June&nbsp;– August) is generally dry. Both rainy seasons occur in summer: the small rainy season between September and November, the big one between February and April.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Real Namibia |title=The Rainy Season |url=http://www.realnamibia.com/rn_028rainyseason.htm |accessdate=28 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906094745/http://www.realnamibia.com/rn_028rainyseason.htm |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Humidity is low, and average rainfall varies from almost zero in the [[Skeleton Coast|coastal desert]] to more than {{cvt|600|mm|in|0}} in the [[Caprivi Strip]].

Weather and climate in the coastal area are dominated by the cold, north-flowing [[Benguela Current]] of the Atlantic Ocean, which accounts for very low [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] ({{cvt|50|mm|in|0}} per year or less), frequent dense fog, and overall lower temperatures than in the rest of the country.<ref name="EBClimate"/> In Winter, occasionally a condition known as ''{{lang|de|[[Bergwind]]}}'' (German for "mountain breeze") or ''{{lang|af|Oosweer}}'' ([[Afrikaans]] for "east weather") occurs, a hot dry wind blowing from the inland to the coast.

===Water sources===
{{Main|Water supply and sanitation in Namibia}}
Namibia is the driest country in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and depends largely on groundwater. With an average rainfall of about {{cvt|350|mm|in|0}} per annum, the highest rainfall occurs in the [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi]] in the northeast (about {{cvt|600|mm|in|0}} per annum) and decreases in a westerly and southwesterly direction to as little as {{cvt|50|mm|in|0}} and less per annum at the coast. The only perennial rivers are found on the national borders with [[South Africa]], [[Angola]], [[Zambia]], and the short border with [[Botswana]] in the [[Caprivi Strip|Caprivi]]. In the interior of the country, surface water is available only in the summer months when rivers are in flood after exceptional rainfalls. Otherwise, surface water is restricted to a few large storage dams retaining and damming up these seasonal floods and their runoff. Where people do not live near perennial rivers or make use of the storage dams, they are dependent on groundwater. Even isolated communities and those economic activities located far from good surface water sources, such as mining, agriculture, and tourism, can be supplied from groundwater over nearly 80% of the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php |title=Groundwater in Namibia |website=Integrated Water Resource Management |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729155617/http://www.iwrm-namibia.info.na/iwrm/fundaments-in-iwrm/groundwater-in-namibia/index.php |archive-date=29 July 2016 }}</ref>

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Namibia}}
Namibia follows a largely independent [[foreign policy]], with persisting affiliations with states that aided the independence struggle, including [[Cuba]]. With a small army and a fragile economy, the Namibian Government's principal foreign policy concern is developing strengthened ties within the Southern African region. A dynamic member of the [[Southern African Development Community]], Namibia is a vocal advocate for greater regional integration. Namibia became the 160th member of the UN on 23 April 1990. On its independence it became the fiftieth member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://africanhistory.about.com/od/eraindependence/a/CmnWealth.htm |title=Africa and the CON |publisher=Africanhistory.about.com|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref>

The constitution of Namibia defined the role of the military as "''defending the territory and national interests.''" Namibia formed the [[Namibian Defence Force]] (NDF), comprising former enemies in a 23-year bush war: the [[People's Liberation Army of Namibia]] (PLAN) and [[South West Africa]]n ''Territorial Force'' ([[SWATF]]). The British formulated the plan for integrating these forces and began training the NDF, which consists of a small headquarters and five battalions.

The [[United Nations Transitional Assistance Group]] (UNTAG)'s Kenyan infantry battalion remained in Namibia for three months after independence to help train the NDF and to stabilise the north. According to the [[Namibian Defence Ministry]], enlistments of both men and women will number no more than 7,500. The current minister of the Namibian Military is Hon Penda YaNdakolo

In 2013, global business and financial news provider, [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]], named Namibia the top emerging market economy in Africa and the 13th best in the world. Only four African countries made the Top 20 Emerging Markets list in the March 2013 issue of Bloomberg Markets magazine, and Namibia was rated ahead of [[Morocco]] (19th), South Africa (15th) and [[Zambia]] (14th). Worldwide, Namibia also fared better than Hungary, Brazil and Mexico. Bloomberg Markets magazine ranked the top 20 based on more than a dozen criteria. The data came from Bloomberg's own financial-market statistics, IMF forecasts and the World Bank. The countries were also rated on areas of particular interest to foreign investors: the ease of doing business, the perceived level of corruption and economic freedom. In order to attract foreign investment, the government has made improvement in reducing red tape resulted from excessive government regulations making the country one of the least bureaucratic places to do business in the region. However, facilitation payments are occasionally demanded by customs due to cumbersome and costly customs procedures.<ref>{{cite web|title=Snapshot of Namibia Country Profile|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/sub-saharan-africa/namibia/snapshot.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=6 February 2014}}</ref> Namibia is also classified as an Upper Middle Income country by the [[World Bank]], and ranks 87th out of 185 economies in terms of ease of doing business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploreeconomies/namibia/ |title=Namibia |publisher=Doingbusiness.org |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>

Despite the remote nature of much of the country, Namibia has seaports, airports, highways, and [[Rail transport in Namibia|railways]] (narrow-gauge). The country seeks to become a regional transportation hub; it has an important seaport and several landlocked neighbours. The Central Plateau already serves as a [[transportation corridor]] from the more densely populated north to South Africa, the source of four-fifths of Namibia's imports.<ref name="World Almanac 2004" />

=== Income disparity ===
According to recent statistics on the country's income share held by the highest 10%, Namibia is a country with a substantive income disparity. The data indicates that the current income share held by the highest 10% is approximately 51.8%. This disparity that exists in the country illustrates the large gap between the rich and the poor. An additional figure describes the poverty gap: people living on US$2 or less in the country are approximately 17.72% of the population.

===Agriculture===
{{Main|Agriculture in Namibia}}
[[File:Schildburgsdorf.jpg|thumb|Welcoming sign of the ''Burgsdorf'' farm in [[Hardap Region|Hardap]]]]
About half of the population depends on agriculture (largely [[subsistence agriculture]]) for its livelihood, but Namibia must still import some of its food. Although per capita GDP is five times the per capita GDP of Africa's poorest countries, the majority of Namibia's people live in rural areas and exist on a subsistence way of life. Namibia has one of the [[List of countries by income equality|highest rates of income inequality]] in the world, due in part to the fact that there is an urban economy and a more rural cashless economy. The inequality figures thus take into account people who do not actually rely on the formal economy for their survival. Although arable land accounts for only 1% of Namibia, nearly half of the population is employed in agriculture.<ref name="World Almanac 2004">World Almanac. 2004.</ref>

About 4,000, mostly white, commercial farmers own almost half of Namibia's arable land.<ref>LaFraniere, Sharon (25 December 2004) [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/25/international/africa/25namibia.html Tensions Simmer as Namibia Divides Its Farmland"], ''The New York Times''</ref> The governments of Germany and Britain will finance Namibia's [[land reform]] process, as Namibia plans to start expropriating land from white farmers to resettle landless black Namibians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=51556 |title=NAMIBIA: Key step in land reform completed |publisher=IRIN Africa |date=1 October 2004 |accessdate=10 September 2013}}</ref>

Agreement has been reached on the [[privatisation]] of several more enterprises in coming years, with hopes that this will stimulate much needed foreign investment. However, reinvestment of environmentally derived capital has hobbled Namibian per capita income.<ref name=Lange/> One of the fastest growing areas of economic development in Namibia is the growth of [[Communal Wildlife Conservancies in Namibia|wildlife conservancies]].

===Mining and electricity===

Domestic supply voltage is 220 V AC. Electricity is generated mainly by thermal and hydroelectric power plants. Non-conventional methods of electricity generation also play some role.

===Diamonds===
Although much of the world's diamond supply comes from what have been called African [[blood diamonds]], Namibia has managed to develop a diamond mining industry largely free of the kinds of conflict, extortion, and murder that have surrounded that of many other African nations with diamond mines.  This has been attributed to political dynamics, economic institutions, grievances, political geography, and the effects of neighborhoods, and is the result of a joint agreement between the government and [[De Beers]] which has led to a taxable base, strengthening state institutions.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=South African Security|title=Diamonds Without Blood: A Look at Namibia|author=Nathan Munier|date=1 March 2016|volume=9|issue=1|pages=21–41|doi=10.1080/19392206.2016.1132903}}</ref>

sanitation is insufficient in most residential areas. Private flush
toilets are too expensive for virtually all residents in [[township]]s due to their water consumption and installation cost. As a result, access to [[improved sanitation]] has not increased much since independence:
In Namibia's rural areas 13% of the population had more than basic

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Namibia}}
[[File:NamibiaMehrsprachigkeit.jpg|thumb|left|Although its official language is English, Namibia is a multilingual country as is illustrated by these examples in English, German, [[Afrikaans]] and [[Oshiwambo language|Oshiwambo]].]]
Up to 1990, English, [[German language in Namibia|German]], and [[Afrikaans]] were official languages. Long before Namibia's independence from South Africa, SWAPO was of the opinion that the country should become officially monolingual, choosing this approach in contrast to that of its neighbour South Africa (which granted [[Languages of South Africa|all 11 of its major languages]] official status), which was seen by them as "a deliberate policy of ethnolinguistic fragmentation."<ref>Pütz, Martin (1995) "Official Monolingualism in Africa: A sociolinguistic assessment of linguistic and cultural pluralism in Africa", p. 155 in ''Discrimination through language in Africa? Perspectives on the Namibian Experience''. Mouton de Gruyter. Berlin, {{ISBN|311014817X}}</ref> Consequently, SWAPO instituted English as the sole official language of Namibia though only about 3% of the population speaks it as a home language. Its implementation is focused on the civil service, education and the broadcasting system, especially the state broadcaster NBC.<ref name=kriger>{{cite book |last1=Kriger |first1=Robert & Ethel |title=Afrikaans Literature: Recollection, Redefinition, Restitution. |date=1996 |publisher=Rodopi Bv Editions |isbn=978-9042000513 |pages=66–67}}</ref> Some other languages have received semi-official recognition by being allowed as medium of instruction in primary schools. It is expected of private schools to follow the same policy as state schools, and "English language" is a compulsory subject.<ref name=kriger/> Some critics however argue that, as in other postcolonial African societies, the push for monolingual instruction and policy has resulted in a high rate of school drop-outs and of individuals whose academic competence in any language is low.<ref>Tötemeyer, Andree-Jeanne. ''Multilingualism and the language policy for Namibian schools.'' PRAESA Occasional Papers No. 37. University of Cape Town. Cape Town:2010.</ref>

==Media==
{{see also|Media of Namibia}}
Although Namibia's population is fairly small, the country has a diverse choice of media; two TV stations, 19 radio stations (without counting community stations), 5 daily newspapers, several weeklies and special publications compete for the attention of the audience. Additionally, a mentionable amount of foreign media, especially South African, is available. Online media are mostly based on print publication contents. Namibia has a state-owned Press Agency, called [[Namibia Press Agency|NAMPA]].<ref name=Rothe>Rothe, Andreas (2010): Media System and News Selection in Namibia. p. 14-96</ref> Overall {{circa}} 300 journalists work in the country.<ref name=jobs>{{Cite news | title=40 journalists lose jobs since 2016 | last1=Kahiurika | first1=Ndanki | last2=Ngutjinazo | first2=Okeri | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=22 January 2019 | page=6 | url=https://www.namibian.com.na/74849/read/40-journalists-lose-jobs-since-2016}}</ref>

The first newspaper in Namibia was the German-language ''[[Windhoeker Anzeiger]]'', founded 1898. During German rule, the newspapers mainly reflected the living reality and the view of the white German-speaking minority. The black majority was ignored or depicted as a threat. During South African rule, the white bias continued, with mentionable influence of the Pretoria government on the "South West African" media system. Independent newspapers were seen as a menace to the existing order, and critical journalists were often threatened.<ref name=Rothe/><ref>von Nahmen, Carsten (2001): Deutschsprachige Medien in Namibia</ref><ref name=Links>Links, Frederico (2006): We write what we like: The role of independent print media and independent reporting in Namibia</ref>

Current daily newspapers are the private publications ''[[The Namibian]]'' (English and other languages), ''[[Die Republikein]]'' (Afrikaans), [[Allgemeine Zeitung (Namibia)|Allgemeine Zeitung]] (German) and ''[[Namibian Sun]]'' (English) as well as the state-owned ''[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]'' (predominantly English). Except for the largest newspaper, ''The Namibian'', which is owned by a trust, the other mentioned private newspapers are part of the [[Democratic Media Holdings]].<ref name=Rothe/> Other mentionable newspapers are the tabloid ''[[Informanté]]'' owned by [[Trustco Group Holdings|TrustCo]], the weekly ''[[Windhoek Observer]]'', the weekly ''[[Namibia Economist]]'', as well as the regional ''[[Namib Times]]''. Current affairs magazines include ''[[Insight Namibia]]'', ''[[Vision2030 Focus magazine]]''{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and ''[[Prime FOCUS]]''. The ''[[Sister Namibia]]'' magazine stands out as the longest running NGO magazine in Namibia, while ''[[Namibia Sport]]'' is the only national sport magazine. Furthermore, the print market is complemented with party publications, student newspapers and PR publications.<ref name=Rothe/>

Radio was introduced in 1969, TV in 1981. The broadcasting sector today is dominated by the state-run [[Namibian Broadcasting Corporation]] (NBC). The [[public broadcasting|public broadcaster]] offers a TV station as well as a "National Radio" in English and nine language services in locally spoken languages. The nine private radio stations in the country are mainly English-language channels, except for Radio Omulunga (Oshiwambo) and Kosmos 94.1 (Afrikaans).

Namibia has free education for both primary and secondary education levels. Grades 1–7 are primary level, grades 8–12 are secondary. In 1998, there were 400,325 Namibian students in primary school and 115,237 students in secondary schools. The pupil-teacher ratio in 1999 was estimated at 32:1, with about 8% of the GDP being spent on education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Namibia-EDUCATION.html |title=Namibia – Education |publisher=Encyclopedia of Nations}}</ref> Curriculum development, educational research, and professional development of teachers is centrally organised by the National Institute for Educational Development (NIED) in Okahandja.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nied.edu.na/ |title=National Institute for Educational Development |publisher=Nied.edu.na |accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>

Most schools in Namibia are state-run, but there are some private schools, which are also part of the country's education system. There are four teacher training universities, three colleges of agriculture, a police training college, and three universities: [[University of Namibia]] (UNAM), [[International University of Management]] (IUM) and [[Namibia University of Science and Technology]] (NUST).

Namibia faces non-communicable disease burden. The Demographic and Health Survey (2013) summarizes findings on elevated blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes and obesity:
* Among eligible respondents age 35–64, more than 4 in 10 women (44 percent) and men (45 percent) have elevated blood pressure or are currently taking medicine to lower their blood pressure.
* Forty-nine percent of women and 61 percent of men are not aware that they have elevated blood pressure.
* Forty-three percent of women and 34 percent of men with hypertension are taking medication for their condition.
* Only 29 percent of women and 20 percent of men with hypertension are taking medication and have their blood pressure under control.
* Six percent of women and 7 percent of men are diabetic; that is, they have elevated fasting plasma glucose values or report that they are taking diabetes medication. An additional 7 percent of women and 6 percent of men are prediabetic.
* Sixty-seven percent of women and 74 percent of men with diabetes are taking medication to lower their blood glucose.
* Women and men with a higher-than-normal body mass index (25.0 or higher) are more likely to have elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting blood glucose.<ref name=":3">Ministry of Health and Social Services (2013); ICF Macro (2013) Namibia Demographic and Health Survey 2013<nowiki/>https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR298/FR298.pdf {{PD-notice}}</ref>&nbsp;

The [[HIV/AIDS in Namibia|HIV epidemic]] remains a public health issue in Namibia despite significant achievements made by the Ministry of Health and Social Services to expand HIV treatment services.<ref>{{cite conference |conference=Namibia AIDS Conference 2016: 28 to 30 November 2016 |url=http://www.namaidscon.net/media/downloads/downloads/speeches/aids_conference_rapporteur.pdf |title=Together We Are Ending AIDS in Namibia |accessdate=2017-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116155355/http://www.namaidscon.net/media/downloads/downloads/speeches/aids_conference_rapporteur.pdf |archivedate=16 January 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2001, there were an estimated 210,000 people living with HIV/AIDS, and the estimated death toll in 2003 was 16,000. According to the 2011 UNAIDS Report, the epidemic in Namibia "appears to be leveling off."<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/documents/unaidspublication/2011/JC2216_WorldAIDSday_report_2011_en.pdf|title= UNAIDS World AIDS Day Report 2011 | publisher = UNAIDS|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref> As the HIV/AIDS epidemic has reduced the working-aged population, the number of orphans has increased. It falls to the government to provide education, food, shelter and clothing for these orphans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsinafrica.net/ |title=Aidsinafrica.net |publisher=Aidsinafrica.net|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref> A Demographic and Health Survey with an HIV biomarker was completed in [https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR298/FR298.pdf 2013] and served as the fourth comprehensive, national-level population and health survey conducted in Namibia as part of the global Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme. The DHS observed important characteristics associated to the HIV epidemic:
* Overall, 26 percent of men age 15–49 and 32 percent of those age 50–64 have been circumcised.&nbsp;HIV prevalence for men age 15–49 is lower among circumcised (8.0 percent) than among uncircumcised men (11.9 percent). The pattern of lower HIV prevalence among circumcised than uncircumcised men is observed across most background characteristics. For each age group, circumcised men have lower HIV prevalence than those who are not circumcised; the difference is especially pronounced for men age 35–39 and 45–49 (11.7 percentage points each). The difference in HIV prevalence between uncircumcised and circumcised men is larger among urban than rural men (5.2 percentage points versus 2.1 percentage points).
* HIV prevalence among respondents age 15–49 is 16.9 percent for women and 10.9 percent for men. HIV prevalence rates among women and men age 50–64 are similar (16.7 percent and 16.0 percent, respectively).
* HIV prevalence peaks in the 35–39 age group for both women and men (30.9 percent and 22.6 percent, respectively). It is lowest among respondents age 15–24 (2.5–6.4 percent for women and 2.0–3.4 percent for men).
* Among respondents age 15–49, HIV prevalence is highest for women and men in Zambezi (30.9 percent and 15.9 percent, respectively) and lowest for women in Omaheke (6.9 percent) and men in Ohangwena (6.6 percent).
* In 76.4 percent of the 1,007 cohabiting couples who were tested for HIV in the 2013 NDHS, both partners were HIV negative; in 10.1 percent of the couples, both partners were HIV positive; and 13.5 percent of the couples were discordant (that is, one partner was infected with HIV and the other was not).<ref name=":3" />
As of 2015, the Ministry of Health and Social Services and UNAIDS produced a Progress [http://www.unaids.org/sites/default/files/country/documents/NAM_narrative_report_2015.pdf Report] in which [[UNAIDS]] projected HIV prevalence among 15&nbsp;– 49 year olds at 13.3% [12.2%&nbsp;– 14.5%] and an estimated 210 000 [200 000&nbsp;– 230 000] living with HIV.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/namibia|title=HIV and AIDS estimates (2015)|website=Unaids.org|access-date=2017-08-26}}</ref>

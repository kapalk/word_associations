'''Monaco''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Monaco.ogg|ˈ|m|ɒ|n|ə|k|oʊ}}; {{IPA-fr|mɔnako}}), officially the '''Principality of Monaco''' ({{lang-fr|Principauté de Monaco}}),{{efn|name=a}} is a sovereign [[city-state]], [[country]], and [[microstate]] on the [[French Riviera]] in [[Western Europe]]. [[France]] borders the country on three sides while the other side  borders the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

Monaco has an area of {{convert|2.020|km²|abbr=on}}, making it the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|second-smallest]] country in the world after the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Its population was about 38,400 based on the last census of 2016.<ref name="imsee.mc" /> With 19,009 inhabitants per km², it is the [[List of countries by population density|most densely-populated]] [[sovereign state]] in the world<!--Note: Macau is more dense, but is a dependency, not a country-->. Monaco has a land border of {{convert|5.47|km|abbr=on}},<ref name="imsee.mc" /> a coastline of {{convert|3.83|km|abbr=on}}, and a width that varies between {{convert|1700|and|349|m|abbr=on|yd}}. The highest point in the country is a narrow pathway named [[Chemin des Révoires]] on the slopes of [[Mont Agel]], in the [[Les Révoires]] ''Ward'', which is {{convert|161|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. Monaco's most populous ''Quartier'' is [[Monte Carlo]] and the most populous ''Ward'' is [[Larvotto|Larvotto/Bas Moulins]]. Through [[land reclamation]], Monaco's land mass has [[Land reclamation in Monaco|expanded by 20 percent]]; in 2005, it had an area of only {{convert|1.974|km²|abbr=on}}. Monaco is known as a playground for the rich and famous, due to its tax laws. In 2014, it was noted that about 30% of the population was made up of millionaires.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profit.ndtv.com/news/global-economy/article-one-in-three-is-a-millionaire-in-monaco-study-650514|title=One in Three is a Millionaire in Monaco: Study|work=ndtv.com}}</ref>

Monaco is a [[principality]] governed under a form of [[constitutional monarchy]], with [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II]] as [[head of state]]. Although Prince Albert II is a constitutional monarch, he wields immense political power. The [[House of Grimaldi]] has ruled Monaco, with brief interruptions, since 1297.<ref>In fact [[François Grimaldi|Francesco Grimaldi]], who captured [[Monaco-Ville|the Rock]] on the night of 8 January 1297, was forced to flee Monaco only four years after the fabled raid, never to come back. The Grimaldi family was not able to permanently secure their holding until 1419 when they purchased Monaco, along with two neighbouring villages, [[Menton]] and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]].

Despite Monaco's independence and separate foreign policy, its defense is the responsibility of France. However, Monaco does maintain two small [[Military of Monaco|military units]].

Economic development was spurred in the late 19th century with the opening of the country's first casino, [[Monte Carlo Casino|Monte Carlo]], and a railway connection to Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montecarlolegend.com/monte-carlo-the-birth-of-a-legend/|title=Monte Carlo : The Birth of a Legend|publisher=SBM Group |date=|accessdate=23 August 2013}}</ref> Since then, Monaco's mild climate, scenery, and gambling facilities have contributed to the principality's status as a tourist destination and recreation centre for the rich. In more recent years, Monaco has become a major [[banking centre]] and has sought to diversify its economy into the services sector and small, [[High value products|high-value-added]], non-polluting industries. The state has no [[income tax]], [[Tax rates around the world|low business taxes]], and is well known for being a [[tax haven]]. It is also the host of the annual street circuit motor race [[Monaco Grand Prix]], one of the original Grands Prix of [[Formula One]]. The principality has a club football team; [[AS Monaco]], who have become [[List of French football champions|French]] champions on multiple occasions.

Monaco is not formally a part of the [[European Union]] (EU), but it [[Monaco–European Union relations|participates in certain EU policies]], including customs and border controls. Through its relationship with France, Monaco uses the [[euro]] as its sole currency (prior to this it used the [[Monégasque franc]]). Monaco joined the [[Council of Europe]] in 2004. It is a member of the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF).

An ousted branch of a Genoese family, the [[House of Grimaldi|Grimaldi]], contested it for a hundred years before actually gaining control. Though the [[Republic of Genoa]] would last until the 19th century, they allowed the Grimaldi family to keep Monaco, and, likewise, both France and [[Spain]] left it alone for hundreds of years. France did not annex it until the [[French Revolution]], but after the defeat of [[Napoleon]] it was put under the care of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. In the 19th century, when [[Sardinia]] became a part of [[Italy]], the region came under French influence again but France allowed it to remain independent. Like France, Monaco was overrun by the [[Axis powers]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]] and for a short time was administered by Italy, then the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], before finally being liberated. Although the occupation lasted for just a short time, it meant the deportation of the [[Jews|Jewish]] population and execution of several [[French Resistance|resistance]] members from Monaco. Since then Monaco has been independent.  It has taken some steps towards [[Microstates and the European Union|integration with the European Union]].

[[File:Monegasque Revolution.jpg|thumb|left|Mayor of Monaco announcing concessions ending absolute monarchy of [[Prince Albert I]] in 1910]]
Until the [[Monegasque Revolution]] of 1910 forced the adoption of the [[Constitution of Monaco|1911 constitution]], the [[List of rulers of Monaco|princes of Monaco]] were [[Absolute monarchy|absolute rulers]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/country_profiles/2530539.stm |title=Monaco timeline |publisher=BBC News |date=28 March 2012 |accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> The new constitution, however, barely reduced the autocratic rule of the Grimaldi family and [[Prince Albert I]] soon suspended it during the [[First World War]].

In July 1918, the [[Franco-Monegasque Treaty]] was signed, providing for limited French protection over Monaco. The treaty, endorsed in 1919 by the [[Treaty of Versailles]], established that Monegasque international policy would be aligned with French political, military, and economic interests, and resolved the [[Monaco Succession Crisis of 1918|Monaco Succession Crisis]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Monaco-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html |title=Monaco Politics, government, and taxation|publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>

[[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Rainier III]], who ruled until 2005, succeeded to the throne following the death of his grandfather, Prince [[Louis II, Prince of Monaco|Louis II]], in 1949. On 19 April 1956, Prince Rainier married the American actress [[Grace Kelly]]; the event was widely televised and covered in the popular press, focusing the world's attention on the tiny principality.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/monaco.htm |title=Monaco – Principality of Monaco – Principauté de Monaco – French Riviera Travel and Tourism |publisher=Nationsonline.org |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>

A 1962 amendment to the constitution abolished capital punishment, provided for [[women's suffrage]], and established a [[Supreme Court of Monaco]] to guarantee fundamental liberties.

In 1963, a crisis developed when [[Charles de Gaulle]] blockaded Monaco, angered by its status as a tax haven for wealthy French. The 2014 film ''[[Grace of Monaco (film)|Grace of Monaco]]'' is loosely based on this crisis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pagesix.com/2014/04/02/monaco-royals-will-not-be-at-cannes-grace-of-monaco-premiere/?_ga=1.162783800.562580333.1395152845|title=Monaco royals will not be at Cannes ‘Grace of Monaco’ premiere – Page Six|work=Page Six}}</ref>

In 2002, a new treaty between France and Monaco specified that, should there be no heirs to carry on the Grimaldi dynasty, the principality would still remain an independent nation rather than revert to France. Monaco's military defence, however, is still the responsibility of France.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europe-cities.com/en/657/monaco/history/chronology/ |title=History of Monaco.

On 27 August 2015, Albert II apologized for Monaco's role during [[World War II]] in facilitating the deportation of a total of 90 Jews and resistance fighters, of whom only nine survived. "We committed the irreparable in handing over to the neighbouring authorities women, men and a child who had taken refuge with us to escape the persecutions they had suffered in France," Albert said at a ceremony in which a monument to the victims was unveiled at the Monaco cemetery.

===Architecture===
{{See also|Monaco villas}}
Monaco exhibits a wide range of architecture, but the principality's signature style, particularly in Monte Carlo, is that of the [[Belle Epoque]]. It finds its most florid expression in the 1878–9 [[Monte Carlo Casino|Casino]] and the [[Opéra de Monte-Carlo|Salle Garnier]] created by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]] and Jules Dutrou. Decorative elements including turrets, balconies, pinnacles, multi-coloured ceramics and caryatids and borrowed and blended to create a picturesque fantasy of pleasure and luxury, and an alluring expression of how Monaco sought, and still seeks, to portray itself.<ref>Novella, René; Sassi, Luca ''Monaco : eight centuries of art and architecture', Epi Communication, 2015</ref> This [[Capriccio (art)|capriccio]] of French, Italian and Spanish elements was incorporated into hacienda villas and apartments. Following major development in the 1970s, [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Rainier III]] banned high-rise development in the principality. However, his successor, [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert II]], overturned this Sovereign Order.<ref name="Fair">{{Cite web|url=http://www.vanityfair.fr/actualites/france/articles/monaco-la-tour-odeon-un-chantier-malheureux/23582|title=La tour Odéon, l'histoire d'un chantier dont les malheurs ont atteint des sommets|last=Fair|first=Vanity|access-date=7 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813111930/http://www.vanityfair.fr/actualites/france/articles/monaco-la-tour-odeon-un-chantier-malheureux/23582|archive-date=13 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In recent years the accelerating demolition of Monaco's architectural heritage, including its single-family villas, has created dismay.<ref>Lyall, Sarah; Baume, Maïa de la ''Development Blitz Provokes a Murmur of Dissent in Monaco'', New York Times,  11 December 2013; https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/world/europe/development-blitz-provokes-a-murmur-of-dissent-in-monaco.html</ref> The principality currently has no heritage protection legislation.<ref name="lobservateurdemonaco.mc">''Monaco's Heritage In Danger?'', L'Observateur de Monaco, No141, April 2015, pp60-67;http://www.lobservateurdemonaco.mc/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Obs141.pdf</ref>

=== Climate ===
Monaco has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Csa), which is influenced by [[oceanic climate]] and [[humid subtropical climate]]. As a result, it has warm, dry summers and mild, rainy winters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/monaco/weather-climate-geography |title=Monaco weather, climate and geography |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net |date= |accessdate=6 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821004256/http://www.worldtravelguide.net/monaco/weather-climate-geography |archive-date=21 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Cool and rainy interludes can interrupt the dry summer season, the average length of which is also shorter. Summer afternoons are infrequently hot (indeed, temperatures greater than {{convert|30|°C|°F|disp=or}} are rare) as the atmosphere is temperate because of constant sea breezes. On the other hand, the nights are very mild, due to the fairly high temperature of the sea in summer. Generally, temperatures do not drop below {{convert|20|°C}} in this season. In the winter, frosts and snowfalls are extremely rare and generally occur once or twice every ten years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montecarlodailyphoto.com/2009/12/snow-in-casino-square.html |title=Snow in Casino Square! |publisher=Monte Carlo Daily Photo |date=19 December 2009 |accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitmonaco.com/us/About-Monaco/Weather |title=Monaco – Weather / Monaco Official Site |publisher=Visitmonaco.com |date=|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> On February 27, 2018, both Monaco and [[Monte Carlo]] experienced snowfall.<ref>{{cite web |title=In Pictures: French Riviera hit by snowfall |url=https://www.thelocal.fr/20180226/in-pictures-french-riviera-in-the-snow |website=www.thelocal.fr |date=26 February 2018}}</ref>

The state retains [[Monopoly|monopolies]] in numerous sectors, including tobacco and the postal service. The telephone network ([[Monaco Telecom]]) used to be fully owned by the state; it now owns only 45%, while the remaining 55% is owned by both [[Cable & Wireless Communications]] (49%) and [[Compagnie Monégasque de Banque]] (6%). It is still, however, a monopoly. Living standards are high, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mn.html |title=CIA – The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref>

Monaco is not a member of the [[European Union]]. However, it is very closely linked via a customs union with France and, as such, its currency is the same as that of France, the [[euro]]. Before 2002, Monaco minted its own coins, the [[Monegasque franc]]. Monaco has acquired the right to mint [[euro coins]] with [[Monegasque euro coins|Monegasque designs]] on its national side.

=== Gambling industry ===
[[File:Le casino de Monte-Carlo.JPG|thumb|[[Monte Carlo Casino]]]]
The plan for casino gambling was drafted during the reign of [[Florestan I, Prince of Monaco|Florestan I]] in 1846. Under Louis-Philippe's [[Petite bourgeoisie|petite-bourgeois]] regime, however, a dignitary such as the [[Prince of Monaco]] was not allowed to operate a gambling house.<ref name="state1"/>  All this changed in the dissolute [[Second French Empire]] under [[Napoleon III]]. The [[House of Grimaldi]] was in dire need of money. The towns of [[Menton, France|Menton]] and [[Roquebrune-Cap-Martin|Roquebrune]], which had been the main sources of income for the Grimaldi family for centuries, were now accustomed to a much improved standard of living and lenient taxation thanks to Sardinian intervention and clamored for financial and political concession, even for separation. The Grimaldi family hoped the newly legal industry would help alleviate the difficulties they faced, above all the crushing debt the family had incurred, but Monaco's first casino would not be ready to operate until after [[Charles III, Prince of Monaco|Charles III]] assumed the throne in 1856.

The grantee of the princely concession (licence) was unable to attract enough business to sustain the operation and, after relocating the casino several times, sold the concession to French casino magnates [[François Blanc|François]] and [[Louis Blanc (businessman)|Louis Blanc]] for 1.7&nbsp;million francs. The Blancs had already set up a highly successful casino (in fact the largest in Europe) in Bad-Homburg in the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Homburg, a small German principality comparable to Monaco, and quickly petitioned Charles III to rename a depressed seaside area known as "Les Spelegures (Den of Thieves)" to "Monte Carlo (Mount Charles)."<ref name="Craps">{{cite web |url=http://www.crapsdicecontrol.com/monte_carlo.htm|title=History of Monte Carlo Casino|publisher=Craps Dice Control|accessdate=28 April 2012}}</ref> They then constructed their casino in the newly dubbed "Monte Carlo" and cleared out the area's less-than-savory elements to make the neighborhood surrounding the establishment more conducive to tourism.

The Blancs opened [[Le Grand Casino de Monte Carlo]] in 1858 and the casino benefited from the tourist traffic the newly built French railway system created.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iptv.org/series.cfm/9038/rick_steves_europe/ep:504|title=Rick Steves' Europe: Little Europe: San Marino, Monaco, Vatican City, Liechtenstein, and Andorra|publisher=|access-date=27 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114170925/http://www.iptv.org/series.cfm/9038/rick_steves_europe/ep:504|archive-date=14 November 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Due to the combination of the casino and the railroads, Monaco finally recovered from the previous half-century of economic slump and the principality's success attracted other businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ricksteves.com/tvr/littleeurope504_scr.htm |title=Rick Steves Europe: Little Europe: Five Microcountries |publisher=Ricksteves.com |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> In the years following the casino's opening, Monaco founded its [[Oceanographic Museum]] and the [[Monte Carlo Opera House]], 46 hotels were built and the number of jewelers operating in Monaco increased by nearly five-fold.  In an apparent effort to not overtax citizens, it was decreed that the Monégasque citizens were prohibited from entering the casino unless they were employees.<ref>{{cite web| author=Keremcan| url=https://www.gamblingherald.com/why-do-monaco-laws-forbid-locals-from-gambling/| title=Why Do Monaco Laws Forbid Locals from Gambling?| work=Gambling Herald |date=23 August 2016| accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref>  By 1869, the casino was making such a vast sum of money that the principality could afford to end tax collection from the Monegasques—a master stroke that was to attract affluent residents from all over Europe in a policy that still exists today.

Today, [[Société des bains de mer de Monaco]], which owns Le Grand Casino, still operates in the original building that the Blancs constructed and has since been joined by several other casinos, including the [[Le Casino Café de Paris]], the [[Monte Carlo Sporting Club & Casino]] and the [[Sun Casino]]. The most recent addition in Monte Carlo is the [[Monte-Carlo Bay Hotel & Resort|Monte Carlo Bay Casino]], which sits on 4 hectares of the Mediterranean Sea and, among other things, offers 145 slot machines, all equipped with "[[ticket-in, ticket-out]]" (TITO); it is the first Mediterranean casino to use this technology.<ref name="Porter">{{cite book | year=2006 | title=Frommer's Provence and the Riviera (Fifth. ed.) | author=Porter, D. | author2=D.

=== Taxes ===
Monaco has high social-insurance taxes, payable by both employers and employees. The employers' contributions are between 28% and 40% (averaging 35%) of gross salary, including benefits, and employees pay a further 10% to 14% (averaging 13%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lowtax.net/lowtax/html/jmcpetx.html|title=Monaco Personal Taxation | accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Tour Odéon.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Luxury residential areas in Monaco]] 
Monaco has never levied [[income tax]] on [[individual]]s,<ref name=telegraph/> and foreigners are thus able to use it as a "[[tax haven]]" from their own country's taxes, because as an independent country, Monaco is not obligated to pay taxes to other countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/globalbusiness/7243401/Monaco-might-not-charge-residents-income-tax-but-its-no-tax-haven.html |title=Monaco might not charge residents income tax, but it's no tax haven |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=16 February 2010|accessdate=28 May 2012 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lowtax.net/lowtax/html/jmccfir.html |title=Monaco Country and Foreign Investment Regime |publisher=Lowtax.net |date=|accessdate=22 March 2012}}</ref> The absence of a personal income tax in the principality has attracted to it a considerable number of wealthy "tax refugee" residents from European countries who derive the majority of their income from activity outside Monaco; [[Celebrity|celebrities]] such as [[Formula One]] drivers attract most of the attention, but the vast majority of them are lesser-known business people.<ref name="dailymail1"/><ref>{{cite news|author=David Leigh |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jul/10/frontpagenews.uknews |title=The tax haven that today's super rich City commuters call home |work=The Guardian |date=10 July 2006|accessdate=28 May 2012 |location=London}}</ref> However, due to a bilateral treaty with France, French citizens are still required to pay applicable income and wealth taxes to the French state even if they are resident in Monaco,<ref name="state.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/e/eb/rls/othr/ics/2015/241564.htm|title=France and Monaco|work=U.S. Department of State}}</ref> and the principality also actively discourages the registration of foreign corporations, charging a 33 per cent [[Corporate tax|corporation tax]] on profits unless it can be shown that at least three-quarters of the turnover has been generated within its borders. Unlike classic tax havens, it does not offer offshore financial services.<ref name=telegraph/>

In 1998 the [[Centre for Tax Policy and Administration]], part of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), issued a first report on the consequences of the financial systems of known [[tax haven]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.escapeartist.com/OREQ24/Offshore_Tax_Havens.html |title=Obscure Tax Havens |publisher=Escapeartist.com |date=|accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> Monaco did not appear in the list of these territories until 2004, when the OECD became indignant regarding the Monegasque situation and denounced it in a report, as well as [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Liberia]], and the [[Marshall Islands]], underlining its lack of co-operation regarding financial information disclosure and availability.<ref>''Declaration of 18 April 2004, by the representative of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] Centre for Tax Policy and Administration Gabriel Makhlouf regarding the list of alleged [[tax haven]]s non-cooperatives countries comparable''</ref><ref>''Stage Report 2004: Project of [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] on the detrimental tax practices, [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], Paris, 2004''</ref> However, Monaco went on to overcome the objections of the OECD and was thus removed from its "grey list" of unco-operative jurisdictions. In 2009 it went a step farther and secured a place on its "white list", after signing twelve information exchange treaties with other jurisdictions.<ref name=telegraph/>

In 2000, the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) stated: "The anti-money laundering system in Monaco is comprehensive. However, difficulties have been encountered with Monaco by countries in international investigations on serious crimes that appear to be linked also with tax matters. In addition, the FIU of Monaco (SICCFIN) suffers a great lack of adequate resources. The authorities of Monaco have stated that they will provide additional resources to SICCFIN."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/56/43/33921824.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726051252/http://www.fatf-gafi.org/dataoecd/56/43/33921824.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011 |title=Review to Identify Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories: Increasing the Worldwide Effectiveness of Anti-Money Laundering Measures |publisher=Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering |date=22 June 2000 |location=Paris |page=8 |accessdate=23 May 2009 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref> Also in 2000, a report by the [[National Assembly of France|French parliamentarians]] [[Arnaud Montebourg]] and [[Vincent Peillon]] stated that Monaco had relaxed policies with respect to money laundering, including within its casino, and that the government of Monaco had been placing political pressure on the judiciary, so that alleged crimes were not being properly investigated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/rap-info/i2311-2.asp |title=Assemblee-Nationale report |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |date=27 July 1987 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}</ref> In its Progress Report of 2005, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) identified Monaco, along with 36 other territories, as a [[tax haven]],<ref>''Financial Centres with Significant Offshore Activities in Offshore Financial Centres. The Assessment Program. A Progress Report Supplementary Information, IMF, Washington, 2005''</ref> but in its [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|FATF]] report of the same year it took a positive view of Monaco's measures against money-laundering.<ref>''Review to Identify Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories: Increasing the Worldwide Effectiveness of Anti-Money Laundering Measures, [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|FATF]], Paris, 2005''</ref><ref>''Review to Identify Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories: Increasing the Worldwide Effectiveness of Anti-Money Laundering Measures, FATF, Paris, 2006''</ref>

The [[Council of Europe]] also decided to issue reports naming tax havens. Twenty-two territories, including Monaco, were thus evaluated between 1998 and 2000 on a first round. Monaco was the only territory that refused to perform the second round, between 2001 and 2003, whereas the 21 other territories had planned implementing the third and final round, planned between 2005 and 2007.<ref>''First Mutual Evaluation Report on the Principality of Monaco, Moneyval, Strasbourg, 2003''</ref>

Of interest to [[numismatists]], in Monaco the euro was introduced in 2002, having been preceded by the [[Monégasque franc]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurocoins.co.uk/monaco.html |title=Monaco Euro Coins |publisher=Eurocoins.co.uk |date=1 January 2002 |accessdate=11 May 2017}}</ref> In preparation for this date, the minting of the new euro coins started as early as 2001. Like Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, and Spain, Monaco decided to put the minting date on its coins.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Languages of Monaco}}
The official language of Monaco is [[French language|French]], while [[Italian language|Italian]] is spoken by the principality's sizeable community from Italy. Thus, French and Italian supplants Monegasque, the vernacular language of the Monegasques, which is not recognized as an official language; English is used by [[Americans|American]], [[British people|British]], Anglo-[[Canadians|Canadian]], and [[Irish people|Irish]] residents.
 
The [[Grimaldi Family|Grimaldi]], [[princes of Monaco]], have Ligurian origin, thus, the traditional national language is [[Monégasque language|Monégasque]], a variety of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], now spoken by only a minority of residents and as a common second language by many native residents. In [[Monaco-Ville]], street signs are printed in both French and Monégasque.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monaco-iq.com/society |title=Society |publisher=Monaco-IQ |date= |accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.monte-carlo.mc/en/general/principality-of-monaco/ |title=Principality of Monaco – Monaco Monte-Carlo |publisher=Monte-carlo.mc |date= |accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref>

=== Monte Carlo Rally ===
Since 1911 part of the [[Monte Carlo Rally]] has been held in the principality, originally held at the behest of [[Albert I, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert I]]. Like the Grand Prix, the rally is organized by [[Automobile Club de Monaco]]. It has long been considered to be one of the toughest and most prestigious events in [[rallying]] and from 1973 to 2008 was the opening round of the [[World Rally Championship]] (WRC).<ref>{{cite web |author=Federall |url=http://www.acm.mc/page-tab-histo.php?id_menu=5&id_sousmenu=27 |title=ACM – Automobile Club de Monaco |publisher=Acm.mc |date= |accessdate=6 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109144441/http://www.acm.mc/page-tab-histo.php?id_menu=5&id_sousmenu=27 |archive-date=9 November 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> From 2009 until 2011, the rally served as the opening round of the [[Intercontinental Rally Challenge]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/8238574/Rallye-Monte-Carlo-Historique.html |title=Rallye Monte Carlo Historique |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=|accessdate=6 September 2012}}</ref> The rally returned to the WRC calendar in 2012 and has been held annually since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wrc.com/news/2012-world-rally-championship-events-announced/?fid=14515 |title=2012 World Rally Championship events announced |publisher=wrc.com |date=27 April 2012 |accessdate=28 May 2012}}</ref> Due to Monaco's limited size, all but the ending of the rally is held on French territory.

=== Football ===
[[File:Panoramio - V&A Dudush - stade Louis II.jpg|thumb|left|[[Stade Louis II]], home of [[AS Monaco FC]]]]
Monaco hosts two major football teams in the principality: the men's football club, [[AS Monaco FC]], and the women's football club, OS Monaco. AS Monaco plays at the [[Stade Louis II]] and competes in [[Ligue 1]] the first division of [[French football]]. The club is historically one of the most successful clubs in the French league, having won Ligue 1 eight times (most recently in 2016–17) and competed at the top level for all but six seasons since 1953. The club reached the [[2004 UEFA Champions League Final]], with a team that included [[Dado Pršo]], [[Fernando Morientes]], [[Jérôme Rothen]], [[Akis Zikos]] and [[Ludovic Giuly]], but lost 3–0 to Portuguese team [[FC Porto]]. Many international stars have played for the club, such as French World Cup-winners [[Thierry Henry]], [[Fabien Barthez]], [[David Trezeguet]], and [[Kylian Mbappe]]. The Stade Louis II also played host to the annual [[UEFA Super Cup]] (1998–2012) between the winners of the [[UEFA Champions League]] and the [[UEFA Europa League]].

The women's team, OS Monaco, competes in the women's [[French football league system]]. The club currently plays in the local regional league, deep down in the league system. It once played in the [[Division 1 Féminine]], in the 1994–95 season, but was quickly relegated. Current [[France women's national football team]] goalkeeper [[Sarah Bouhaddi]] had a short stint at the club before going to the [[INF Clairefontaine]] academy.

The [[Monaco national football team]] represents the nation in [[association football]] and is controlled by the [[Monégasque Football Federation]], the governing body for [[football in Monaco]]. However, Monaco is one of only three sovereign states in Europe (along with the [[Vatican City]]) that is not a member of [[UEFA]] and so does not take part in any [[UEFA European Football Championship]] or [[FIFA World Cup]] competitions. The team plays its home matches in the Stade Louis II.

==Relations with other countries==
{{main|Foreign relations of Monaco}}
[[File:Monacoc1890.jpg|thumb|left|''Le Rocher'' in 1890]]
Monaco is so old that it has outlived many of the nations and institutions that it has had relations with. The [[Crown of Aragon]] and [[Republic of Genoa]] became a part of other countries, as did the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]. [[Honoré II, Prince of Monaco]] secured recognition of his independent [[sovereignty]] from [[Spain]] in 1633, and then from [[Louis XIII]] of France by the [[Treaty of Péronne (1641)]].

Monaco made a special agreement with France in 1963 in which French customs laws apply in Monaco and its territorial waters.<ref name="state.gov"/> Monaco uses the [[euro]] but is not a member of the European Union.<ref name="state.gov"/> Monaco shares a {{convert|6|km|mi|adj=mid|abbr=off}} border with France but also has about {{convert|2|km|mi|1|adj=mid|abbr=off}} of coastline with the Mediterranean sea.<ref name="Monaco">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mn.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}</ref> Two important agreements that support Monaco's independence from France include the [[Franco-Monégasque Treaties|Franco-Monégasque Treaty]] of 1861 and the [[Monaco succession crisis of 1918#French Treaty of 1918|French Treaty of 1918]] (see also [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]).

A recurring issue Monaco encounters with other countries is the attempt by foreign nationals to use Monaco to avoid paying taxes in their own country.<ref name="Monaco"/> Monaco actually collects a number of taxes including a 20% VAT and 33% on companies unless they make over 75% of their income inside Monaco.<ref name="Monaco"/> Monaco does not allow dual citizenship, but does have multiple paths to citizenship including by declaration and naturalization.<ref name="Residency">{{cite web|url=http://flagtheory.com/monaco-residency/|title=Principality of Monaco|work=flagtheory.com}}</ref> In many cases the key issue for obtaining citizenship, rather than attaining residency in Monaco, is the person's ties to their departure country.<ref name="Residency"/> For example, French citizens must still pay taxes to France even if they live full-time in Monaco unless they resided in the country before 1962 for at least 5 years.<ref name="Residency"/> In the early 1960s there was some tension between France and Monaco over taxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finance-watch.org/hot-topics/blog/1074-lesson-from-history-monaco-crisis|title=Lessons from history – The Monaco crisis from 1962–1963 and the emancipation of tax havens |author=Charlotte Geiger|work=finance-watch.org}}</ref>

The Holy See dates back to [[early Christianity]], and is the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] [[episcopal see]] of the Catholic Church, with 1.3&nbsp;billion Catholics around the world distributed in the [[Latin Church]] and 23 [[Eastern Catholic Churches]]. The independent Vatican City-state, on the other hand, came into existence in 11 February 1929 by the [[Lateran Treaty]] between the Holy See and [[Italy]], which spoke of it as a new creation,<ref name=Preamble /> not as a vestige of the much larger [[Papal States]] (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of central Italy.

Within the Vatican City are religious and cultural sites such as [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and the [[Vatican Museums]]. They feature some of the world's most famous paintings and sculptures. The unique [[economy of Vatican City]] is supported financially by the sale of [[postage stamp]]s and [[souvenir]]s, fees for admission to museums, and sales of [[publication]]s.

==Name==
The name {{linktext|Vatican City}} was first used in the [[Lateran Treaty]], signed on 11 February 1929, which established the modern city-state. The name is taken from [[Vatican Hill]], the geographic location of the state. "Vatican" is derived from the name of an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] settlement,  ''Vatica'' or ''Vaticum'' meaning garden, located in the general area the Romans called ''vaticanus ager'', "Vatican territory".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The official [[Italian language|Italian]] name of the city is ''{{lang|it|Città del Vaticano}}'' or, more formally, ''{{lang|it|Stato della Città del Vaticano}}'', meaning "Vatican City State". Although the [[Holy See]] (which is distinct from the Vatican City) and the Catholic Church use [[Ecclesiastical Latin]] in official documents, the Vatican City officially uses Italian. The [[Latin]] name is ''{{lang|la|Status Civitatis Vaticanæ}}'';<ref>{{cite web| url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/pius-xii/la/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-xii_apc_19451208_vacantis-apostolicae-sedis.html| title=Apostolic Constitution| language=Latin}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title=Letter to John Cardinal Lajolo| author=Pope Francis| date=8 September 2014| publisher=The Vatican| url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/la/letters/2014/documents/papa-francesco_20140908_lettera-card-giovanni-lajolo.html| language=Latin| accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref> this is used in official documents by not just the Holy See, but in most official Church and [[Pope|Papal]] documents.

{{History of Vatican City}}

The name "Vatican" was already in use in the time of the [[Roman Republic]] for a marshy area on the west bank of the Tiber across from the city of Rome. Under the [[Roman Empire]], many villas were constructed there, after [[Agrippina the Elder]] (14 BC&nbsp;– 18 October [[Anno Domini|AD]] 33) drained the area and laid out her gardens in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor [[Caligula]] (31 August AD 12–24 January AD 41; r. 37–41) built in her gardens a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by [[Nero]], the ''Circus Gaii et Neronis'',<ref>Lanciani, Rodolfo (1892). [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/Lanciani/LANPAC/3*.html#sec16 Pagan and Christian Rome] Houghton, Mifflin.</ref> usually called, simply, the [[Circus of Nero]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/storia/la-citta-del-vaticano-nel-tempo.html|title=Vatican City in the Past|publisher=}}</ref>

Even before the arrival of Christianity, it is supposed that this originally uninhabited part of Rome (the ''ager vaticanus'') had long been considered sacred, or at least not available for habitation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} A shrine dedicated to the Phrygian goddess [[Cybele]] and her consort [[Attis]] remained active long after the [[Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter]] was built nearby.<ref>{{cite web|title=Altar dedicated to Cybele and Attis|url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/x-Schede/MGEs/MGEs_Sala16_03_040.html|publisher=Vatican Museums|accessdate=26 August 2013}}</ref>

The particularly low quality of Vatican water, even after the reclamation of the area, was commented on by the poet [[Martial]] (40 – between 102 and 104 AD).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/8100/research.pdf?sequence=3|title=Damien Martin, "Wine and Drunkenness in Roman Society"|publisher=}}</ref> [[Tacitus]] wrote, that in AD 69, the [[Year of the Four Emperors]], when the northern army that brought [[Vitellius]] to power arrived in Rome, "a large proportion camped in the unhealthy districts of the Vatican, which resulted in many deaths among the common soldiery; and the Tiber being close by, the inability of the Gauls and Germans to bear the heat and the consequent greed with which they drank from the stream weakened their bodies, which were already an easy prey to disease".<ref>Tacitus, ''The Histories'', II, 93, translation by Clifford H. Moore (The Loeb Classical Library, first printed 1925)</ref>

The [[Vatican Obelisk]] was originally taken by [[Caligula]] from [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]] to decorate the ''spina'' of his [[Roman circus|circus]] and is thus its last visible remnant.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] XVI.76.</ref> This area became the site of martyrdom of many Christians after the [[Great Fire of Rome]] in AD 64. Ancient tradition holds that it was in this circus that [[Saint Peter]] was [[Cross of St. Peter|crucified upside-down]].<ref>{{cite web|title=St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11744a.htm#IV|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref>

Opposite the circus was a cemetery separated by the [[Via Cornelia]]. Funeral monuments and mausoleums and small tombs as well as altars to pagan gods of all kinds of polytheistic religions were constructed lasting until before the construction of the Constantinian Basilica of St. Peter's in the first half of the 4th century. Remains of this ancient [[list of necropoleis|necropolis]] were brought to light sporadically during renovations by various popes throughout the centuries, increasing in frequency during the [[Renaissance]] until it was systematically excavated by orders of [[Pope Pius XII]] from 1939 to 1941. The Constantinian basilica was built in 326 over what was believed to be the [[Saint Peter's tomb|tomb of Saint Peter]], buried in that cemetery.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=37b9V9IXDsYC&pg=PA126&dq=Gardner+%22reputed+grave%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=A3gQUqPdOYWThgeirYCgDg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Gardner%20%22reputed%20grave%22&f=false Fred S. Kleiner, ''Gardner's Art through the Ages'' (Cengage Learning 2012] {{ISBN|978-1-13395479-8}}), p. 126</ref>

From then on, the area became more populated in connection with activity at the basilica. A palace was constructed nearby as early as the 5th century during the pontificate of [[Pope Symmachus]] (reigned 498–514).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Vatican.html |title=Vatican |work=Columbia Encyclopedia |edition=Sixth |date=2001–2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207064352/http://www.bartleby.com/65/va/Vatican.html |archive-date=7 February 2006}}</ref>

===Papal States===
{{Main|Papal States}}
{{See also|History of the Papacy}}

[[File:Italy 1796 AD.png|thumb|left|upright|The Italian peninsula in 1796. The shaded yellow territory in central Italy is the Papal State.]]

Popes gradually came to have a secular role as governors of regions near Rome. They ruled the [[Papal States]], which covered a large portion of the Italian peninsula, for more than a thousand years until the mid-19th century, when all the territory belonging to the papacy was seized by the [[Italian unification|newly created]] Kingdom of Italy.

For most of this time the popes did not live at the Vatican. The [[Lateran Palace]], on the opposite side of Rome, was their habitual residence for about a thousand years. From 1309 to 1377, they lived at [[Avignon]] in France. On their return to Rome they chose to live at the Vatican. They moved to the [[Quirinal Palace]] in 1583, after work on it was completed under [[Pope Paul V]] (1605–1621), but on the [[capture of Rome]] in 1870 retired to the Vatican, and what had been their residence became that of the [[Kingdom of Italy|King of Italy]].

===Italian unification===
{{Main|Roman Question}}

In 1870, the Pope's holdings were left in an uncertain situation when [[capture of Rome|Rome itself was annexed]] by the [[Piedmont]]-led forces which had [[Italian unification|united the rest of Italy]], after a nominal resistance by the papal forces. Between 1861 and 1929 the status of the Pope was referred to as the "Roman Question".

Italy made no attempt to interfere with the Holy See within the Vatican walls. However, it confiscated church property in many places. In 1871 the [[Quirinal Palace]] was confiscated by the king of Italy and became the royal palace. Thereafter the popes resided undisturbed within the Vatican walls, and certain papal prerogatives were recognized by the [[Law of Guarantees]], including the right to send and receive ambassadors. But the Popes did not recognise the Italian king's right to rule in Rome, and they refused to leave the Vatican compound until the dispute was resolved in 1929; [[Pope Pius IX]] (1846–1878), the last ruler of the Papal States, was referred to as a "[[prisoner in the Vatican]]". Forced to give up secular power, the popes focused on spiritual issues.<ref name="World History">{{cite book| last=Wetterau| first=Bruce| title=World History: A Dictionary of Important People, Places, and Events, from Ancient Times to the Present| location=New York| publisher=Henry Holt & Co.| year=1994| isbn=978-0805023503}}</ref>

===Lateran treaties===
{{Main|Lateran Treaty}}

This situation was resolved on 11 February 1929, when the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Kingdom of Italy was signed by [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister and Head of Government]] [[Benito Mussolini]] on behalf of King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] and by [[Cardinal Secretary of State]] [[Pietro Gasparri]] for [[Pope Pius XI]].<ref name=Preamble>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/dam/vaticanstate/documenti/leggi-e-decreti/Normative-Penali-e-Amministrative/LateranTreaty.pdf|title=Preamble of the Lateran Treaty|publisher=}}</ref><ref name="lateran"/><ref>[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html#TRATTATO_FRA_LA_SANTA_SEDE_E_L’ITALIA Trattato fra la Santa Sede e l'Italia]</ref> The treaty, which became effective on 7 June 1929, established the independent state of Vatican City and reaffirmed the special status of Catholicism in Italy.<ref name=Statute>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|title=Patti lateranensi, 11 febbraio 1929 – Segreteria di Stato, card.

[[File:The British Army in Italy 1944 NA16179.jpg|thumb|Bands of the British army's 38th Brigade playing in front of St Peter's Basilica, June 1944.]]

The Holy See, which ruled Vatican City, pursued a policy of neutrality during [[World War II]], under the leadership of [[Pope Pius XII]]. Although German troops occupied the city of Rome after the September 1943 [[Armistice of Cassibile]], and the Allies from 1944, they respected Vatican City as neutral territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005446 |title=Rome |publisher=Ushmm.org |accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> One of the main diplomatic priorities of the [[bishop of Rome]] was to prevent the bombing of the city; so sensitive was the pontiff that he protested even the British air dropping of pamphlets over Rome, claiming that the few landing within the city-state violated the Vatican's neutrality.<ref name="Chadwick1">Chadwick, 1988, pp. 222–32</ref> The British policy, as expressed in the minutes of a Cabinet meeting, was: "that we should on no account molest the Vatican City, but that our action as regards the rest of Rome would depend upon how far the Italian government observed the rules of war".<ref name="Chadwick1"/>

After the American entry into the war, the US opposed such a bombing, fearful of offending Catholic members of its military forces, but said that "they could not stop the British from bombing Rome if the British so decided". The British uncompromisingly said "they would bomb Rome whenever the needs of the war demanded".<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 232–36</ref> In December 1942, the British envoy suggested to the Holy See that Rome be declared an "[[open city]]", a suggestion that the Holy See took more seriously than was probably meant by the British, who did not want Rome to be an open city, but Mussolini rejected the suggestion when the Holy See put it to him. In connection with the [[Allied invasion of Sicily]], 500 American aircraft [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed Rome on 19 July 1943]], aiming particularly at the railway hub. Some 1,500 people were killed; Pius XII himself, who had been described in the previous month as "worried sick" about the possible bombing, viewed the aftermath. Another raid took place on 13 August 1943, after Mussolini had been [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|ousted from power]].<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 236–44</ref> On the following day, the new government declared Rome an open city, after consulting the Holy See on the wording of the declaration, but the British had decided that they would never recognize Rome as an open city.<ref>Chadwick, 1988, pp. 244–45</ref>

===Post-war history===
Pius XII had refrained from creating [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] during the war. By the end of World War II, there were several prominent vacancies: [[Cardinal Secretary of State]], [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Camerlengo]], [[Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church|Chancellor]], and Prefect for the [[Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life|Congregation for the Religious]] among them.<ref>{{harvnb|Chadwick|1988|p=304}}</ref> Pius XII [[Cardinals created by Pope Pius XII in 1946|created 32 cardinals in early 1946]], having announced his intentions to do so in his preceding Christmas message.

The [[Military in Vatican City|Pontifical Military Corps]], except for the [[Swiss Guard]], was disbanded by will of [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]], as expressed in a letter of 14 September 1970.<ref name="Vatican State" /> The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Gendarmerie Corps]] was transformed into a civilian [[police]] and security force.

In 1984, a new [[concordat]] between the Holy See and Italy modified certain provisions of the earlier treaty, including the position of Catholicism as the Italian state religion, a position given to it by a statute of the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] of 1848.<ref name=Statute/>

Construction in 1995 of a new guest house, [[Domus Sanctae Marthae]], adjacent to St Peter's Basilica was criticised by Italian environmental groups, backed by Italian politicians. They claimed the new building would block views of the Basilica from nearby Italian apartments.<ref name="guest house">{{cite book|last=Thavis|first=John|title=The Vatican Diaries: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Power, Personalities and Politics at the Heart of the Catholic Church|year=2013|publisher=Viking|location=NY |isbn=978-0-670-02671-5 |pages=121–2}}</ref> For a short while the plans strained the relations between the Vatican and the Italian government.

==Geography==
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2018}}<!--in first part, there are 3 paragraphs without citations-->
{{Main|Geography of Vatican City}}
[[File:Vatican City map EN.png|thumb|upright=2.25|Map of Vatican City, highlighting notable buildings and the Vatican gardens.]]

The name "Vatican" predates Christianity and comes from the Latin ''{{lang|la|[[Vatican Hill|Mons Vaticanus]]}}'', meaning Vatican Mount.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Vatican|title=Vatican (search)|publisher=Online Dictionary|accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref> The territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'', and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields. It is in this territory that [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman ''[[rione]]'' of [[borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city, on the west bank of the river [[Tiber]], the area was an outcrop of the city that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]] (847–855), and later expanded by the current fortification walls, built under [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534–1549), [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] (1559–1565) and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] (1623–1644).
[[File:VaticanCity Annex.jpg|thumb|Territory of Vatican City State according to the [[Lateran Treaty]].]]

When the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that gave the state its form was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some tracts of the frontier, there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part of the frontier a modern wall was constructed.

The territory includes [[St. Peter's Square]], distinguished from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it touches Piazza Pio&nbsp;XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]] which runs from close to the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was constructed by [[Benito Mussolini]] after the conclusion of the Lateran Treaty.

According to the Lateran Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] that are located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[diplomatic mission|embassies]].<ref name="treaty"/><ref name="treaty text"/> These properties, scattered all over Rome and Italy, house essential offices and institutions necessary to the character and mission of the Holy See.<ref name="treaty text">Lateran Treaty of 1929, Articles 13–16</ref>

Castel Gandolfo and the named basilicas are patrolled internally by [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|police agents of Vatican City State]] and not by [[Law enforcement in Italy|Italian police]]. According to the Lateran Treaty (Art. 3) St. Peter's Square, up to but not including the steps leading to the basilica, is normally patrolled by the Italian police.<ref name="treaty">{{cite web|title=Patti Lateranensi|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/archivio/documents/rc_seg-st_19290211_patti-lateranensi_it.html|publisher=vatican.va|accessdate=6 November 2013}}</ref>

There are no passport controls for visitors entering Vatican City from the surrounding Italian territory. There is free public access to Saint Peter's Square and Basilica and, on the occasion of papal general audiences, to the hall in which they are held. For these audiences and for major ceremonies in Saint Peter's Basilica and Square, tickets free of charge must be obtained beforehand. The Vatican Museums, incorporating the Sistine Chapel, usually charge an entrance fee. There is no general public access to the gardens, but guided tours for small groups can be arranged to the gardens and excavations under the basilica. Other places are open to only those individuals who have business to transact there.

===Climate===
Vatican City's climate is the same as Rome's: a temperate, [[Mediterranean climate]] ''Csa'' with mild, rainy winters from October to mid-May and hot, dry summers from May to September. Some minor local features, principally mists and dews, are caused by the anomalous bulk of St Peter's Basilica, the elevation, the fountains and the size of the large paved square.

The gardens, established during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era, are decorated with fountains and sculptures.

The gardens cover approximately {{convert|23|ha|acres}} which is most of the [[Vatican Hill]]. The highest point is {{convert|60|m}} [[above mean sea level]]. Stone walls bound the area in the North, South and West.

The gardens date back to medieval times when orchards and vineyards extended to the north of the Papal [[Apostolic Palace]].<ref name="Pellegrino">{{cite web|url=http://www.pellegrinocattolico.com/ctv/gardens.htm|title=Al Pellegrino Cattolico: ''The Vatican Gardens''|accessdate=21 November 2008|publisher=2008 Al Pellegrino Cattolico s.r.l.

{{Politics of Vatican City|Government of Vatican City}}
{{Main|Politics of Vatican City}}

The politics of Vatican City takes place in an [[absolute monarchy|absolute]] [[elective monarchy]], in which the head of the Roman Catholic Church takes power. The Pope exercises principal legislative, executive, and judicial power over the State of Vatican City (an entity distinct from the [[Holy See]]), which is a rare case of a non-hereditary monarchy.<ref name="nationsencyclopedia1">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Europe/Vatican-City-POLITICS-GOVERNMENT-AND-TAXATION.html|title=Vatican City (Politics, government, and taxation)|publisher=Nations Encyclopedia|accessdate=28 November 2007}}</ref>

Vatican City is one of the few widely recognized independent states that has not become a member of the United Nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56121#.WnNenpM-dsM|title=UN News - FEATURE: Diplomacy of the conscience – The Holy See at the United Nations|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2017-02-07|website=UN News Service Section|language=en|access-date=2018-02-01}}</ref> The Holy See, which is distinct from Vatican City State, has [[United Nations General Assembly observers|permanent observer status]] with all the rights of a full member except for a vote in the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]].

===Political system===
The government of Vatican City has a unique structure. The pope is the sovereign of the state. Legislative authority is vested in the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], a body of cardinals appointed by the pope for five-year periods. Executive power is in the hands of the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State|President of that commission]], assisted by the general secretary and deputy general secretary. The state's foreign relations are entrusted to the Holy See's [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]] and diplomatic service. Nevertheless, the pope has absolute power in the executive, legislative and judicial branches over Vatican City. He is currently the only absolute monarch in Europe.

There are specific departments that deal with health, security, telecommunications, etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/vatican_city.asp|accessdate=4 March 2007|title=Vatican City|publisher=Catholic-Pages.com}}</ref>

The [[Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church|Cardinal Camerlengo]] presides over the [[Apostolic Camera]] to which is entrusted the administration of the property and protection of other [[temporal power (papal)|papal temporal powers and rights]] of the Holy See during the period of the empty throne or Sede Vacante [[sede vacante|(papal vacancy)]]. Those of the Vatican State remain under the control of the Pontifical Commission for the State of Vatican City. Acting with three other cardinals chosen by lot every three days, one from each order of cardinals (cardinal bishop, cardinal priest, and cardinal deacon), he in a sense performs during that period the functions of head of state of Vatican City.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} All the decisions these four cardinals take must be approved by the [[College of Cardinals]] as a whole.

The nobility that was closely associated with the Holy See at the time of the Papal States continued to be associated with the Papal Court after the loss of these territories, generally with merely nominal duties (see [[Master of the Horse#Papal Master of the Horse|Papal Master of the Horse]], [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household]], [[Hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], [[Black Nobility]]). They also formed the ceremonial Noble Guard. In the first decades of the existence of the Vatican City State, [[Executive (government)|executive functions]] were entrusted to some of them, including that of delegate for the State of Vatican City (now denominated president of the Commission for Vatican City). But with the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Pontificalis Domus]]'' of 28 March 1968,<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19680328_pontificalis-domus_lt.html ''Pontificalis Domus''], 3</ref> [[Pope Paul VI]] abolished the honorary positions that had continued to exist until then, such as [[Quartermaster general]] and [[Master of the Horse]].<ref>The site [http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm "Hereditary Officers of the Papal Court"] continues to present these functions and titles as still in use, several decades after their abolition. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313165610/http://www.chivalricorders.org/vatican/pplcourt.htm |date=13 March 2007 }}</ref>

Vatican City State, created in 1929 by the Lateran Pacts, provides the Holy See with a temporal jurisdiction and independence within a small territory. It is distinct from the Holy See. The state can thus be deemed a significant but not essential instrument of the Holy See. The Holy See itself has existed continuously as a juridical entity since Roman Imperial times and has been internationally recognized as a powerful and independent sovereign entity since [[Late Antiquity]] to the present, without interruption even at times when it was deprived of territory (e.g. 1870 to 1929). The Holy See has the oldest active continuous diplomatic service in the world, dating back to at least AD 325 with its legation to the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicea]].<ref>[http://www.catholic-pages.com/vatican/diplomacy.asp "Vatican Diplomacy"].

[[Pope Francis]], born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], was [[Papal conclave, 2013|elected]] on 13 March 2013. His principal subordinate government official for Vatican City as well as the country's [[head of government]] is the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], who since 1952 exercises the functions previously belonging to the [[Governor of Vatican City]]. Since 2001, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State also has the title of president of the Governorate of the State of Vatican City. The current president is Italian Cardinal [[Giuseppe Bertello]], who was appointed on 1 October 2011.

===Administration===
{{Main|Law of Vatican City}}

[[Legislature|Legislative]] functions are delegated to the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]], led by the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]. Its seven members are cardinals appointed by the Pope for terms of five years. Acts of the commission must be approved by the Pope, through the Holy See's [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and before taking effect must be published in a special appendix of the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]''. Most of the content of this appendix consists of routine executive decrees, such as approval for a new set of postage stamps.

[[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is delegated to the Governorate of Vatican City. The Governorate consists of the President of the Pontifical Commission—using the title "President of the Governorate of Vatican City"—a general secretary, and a Vice general secretary, each appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. Important actions of the Governorate must be confirmed by the Pontifical Commission and by the Pope through the Secretariat of State.

The Governorate oversees the central governmental functions through several departments and offices. The directors and officials of these offices are appointed by the Pope for five-year terms. These organs concentrate on material questions concerning the state's territory, including local security, records, transportation, and finances. The Governorate oversees a modern security and police corps, the ''[[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corpo della Gendarmeria dello Stato della Città del Vaticano]]''.

[[Judiciary|Judicial]] functions are delegated to a supreme court, an appellate court, a tribunal ([[Tribunal of Vatican City State]]), and a trial judge. At the Vatican's request, sentences imposed can be served in Italy (see the [[#Crime|section on crime]], below).

The [[Postal code#Country code prefixes|international postal country code prefix]] is ''SCV'', and the only postal code is ''00120'' – altogether ''SCV-00120''.<ref>"International postal code: SCV-00120."

{{Main|Military in Vatican City|Pontifical Swiss Guard|Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State}}

As the Vatican City is an enclave within Italy, its military defence is provided by the [[Italian Armed Forces]]. However, there is no formal defence treaty with Italy, as the Vatican City is a neutral state. Vatican City has no armed forces of its own, although the [[Swiss Guard]] is a military corps of the Holy See responsible for the personal security of the Pope, and resident in the state. Soldiers of the Swiss Guard are entitled to hold Vatican City State passports and nationality. Swiss [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] were historically recruited by Popes as part of an army for the Papal States, and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]] was founded by [[Pope Julius II]] on 22 January 1506 as the pope's personal bodyguard and continues to fulfill that function. It is listed in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'' under "Holy See", not under "State of Vatican City". At the end of 2005, the Guard had 134 members. Recruitment is arranged by a special agreement between the Holy See and [[Switzerland]]. All recruits must be Catholic, unmarried males with Swiss citizenship who have completed their [[basic training]] with the [[Swiss Armed Forces]] with certificates of good conduct, be between the ages of 19 and 30, and be at least {{convert|174|cm|ftin|0|abbr=on}} in height. Members are equipped with [[small arms]] and the traditional [[halberd]] (also called the Swiss voulge), and trained in bodyguarding tactics. The [[Palatine Guard]] and the [[Noble Guard (Vatican)|Noble Guard]], the last armed forces of the Vatican City State, were disbanded by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1970.<ref name="Vatican State">{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/History/Vatican_City_today.htm |title=Vatican City Today |publisher=Vatican City Government |accessdate=28 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211020340/http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/History/Vatican_City_today.htm |archivedate=11 December 2007 }}</ref> As Vatican City has listed every building in its territory on the International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection, the [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]] theoretically renders it immune to armed attack.<ref>{{cite book |last=Duursma |first=Jorri C. |date=1996 |title=Fragmentation and the International Relations of Micro-states: Self-determination and Statehood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CgVDprXjkIYC&lpg=PA396&pg=PA396#v=onepage |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=396 |isbn=9780521563604}}</ref>

Civil defence is the responsibility of the [[Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State]], the national [[fire brigade]]. Dating its origins to the early nineteenth century, the Corps in its present form was established in 1941. It is responsible for fire fighting, as well as a range of civil defence scenarios including flood, natural disaster, and mass casualty management. The Corps is governmentally supervised through the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence, which is also responsible for the Gendarmerie (see below).

The [[Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City|Gendarmerie Corps]] (''Corpo della Gendarmeria'') is the [[gendarmerie]], or police and security force, of Vatican City and the [[extraterritorial properties of the Holy See]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/IT/Servizi/Direzione_SdS_VVFF/corpo_della_gendarmeria.htm |title=Corpo della Gendarmeria |publisher=Stato della Città del Vaticano |language=Italian |accessdate=15 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225094441/http://www.vaticanstate.va/IT/Servizi/Direzione_SdS_VVFF/corpo_della_gendarmeria.htm |archivedate=25 December 2012 }}</ref> The corps is responsible for security, [[public order]], [[border control]], [[road traffic control|traffic control]], [[criminal procedure|criminal investigation]], and other general police duties in Vatican City including providing security for the Pope outside of Vatican City.

Vatican City State is a recognized national territory under international law, but it is the Holy See that conducts diplomatic relations on its behalf, in addition to the Holy See's own diplomacy, entering into [[treaty|international agreements]] in its regard. Vatican City thus has no diplomatic service of its own.

Because of space limitations, Vatican City is one of the few countries in the world that is unable to host embassies. Foreign embassies to the Holy See are located in the city of Rome; only during the Second World War were the staff of some embassies accredited to the Holy See given what hospitality was possible within the narrow confines of Vatican City—embassies such as that of the United Kingdom while Rome was held by the Axis Powers and Germany's when the Allies controlled Rome.

The size of Vatican City is thus unrelated to the large global reach exercised by the Holy See as an entity quite distinct from the state.<ref>[http://ukinholysee.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/news/2007/4485113/gregorian "The Holy See and Diplomacy"], [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521105212/http://ukinholysee.fco.gov.uk/resources/en/news/2007/4485113/gregorian |date=21 May 2009 }}</ref>

However, Vatican City State itself participates in some international organizations whose functions relate to the state as a geographical entity, distinct from the non-territorial legal persona of the Holy See. These organizations are much less numerous than those in which the Holy See participates either as a member or with observer status. They include the following eight, in each of which Vatican City State holds membership:<ref name=Participation>[http://www.vaticanstate.va/EN/State_and_Government/Internationalrelations/Participation_with_international_Organizations.htm "Vatican City State: Participation in International Organizations"].

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Vatican City}}
The Vatican City State budget includes the [[Vatican Museums]] and post office and is supported financially by the sale of [[Postage stamps and postal history of Vatican City|stamps]], [[Vatican euro coins|coins]], medals and tourist mementos; by fees for admission to museums; and by publications sales.{{efn|1=The Holy See's budget, which is distinct from that of Vatican City State, is supported financially by a variety of sources, including investments, real estate income, and donations from Catholic individuals, dioceses, and institutions; these help fund the Roman Curia (Vatican bureaucracy), diplomatic missions, and media outlets. Moreover, an annual collection taken up in dioceses and direct donations go to a non-budgetary fund known as Peter's Pence, which is used directly by the Pope for charity, disaster relief and aid to churches in developing nations.}} The incomes and living standards of lay workers are comparable to those of counterparts who work in the city of Rome.<ref name="economy factbook">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/vt.html|title=Holy See (Vatican City): Economy|work=CIA – The World Factbook|accessdate=10 October 2010}}</ref> Other industries include printing, the production of mosaics, and the manufacture of staff uniforms. There is a [[Vatican Pharmacy]].

The [[Institute for Works of Religion]] (IOR, ''Istituto per le Opere di Religione''), also known as the Vatican Bank, is a financial agency situated in the Vatican that conducts worldwide financial activities. It has multilingual [[automated teller machine|ATM]]s with instructions in [[Latin]], possibly the only ATM in the world with this feature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinalseansblog.org/?p=232|title=A Glimpse Inside the Vatican & Msgr.

Vatican City issues its own coins and stamps. It has used the euro as its currency since 1 January 1999, owing to a special agreement with the European Union (council decision 1999/98). Euro coins and notes were introduced on 1 January 2002—the Vatican does not issue [[euro banknotes]]. Issuance of euro-denominated coins is strictly limited by treaty, though somewhat more than usual is allowed in a year in which there is a change in the papacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/economic_and_monetary_affairs/institutional_and_economic_framework/l25040_en.htm|title=Agreements on monetary relations (Monaco, San Marino, the Vatican and Andorra)|accessdate=23 February 2007|work=Activities of the European Union: Summaries of legislation}}</ref> Because of their rarity, Vatican euro coins are highly sought by collectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cathnews.acu.edu.au/604/100.html|title=Benedict Vatican euros set for release|accessdate=25 September 2014|work=Catholic News|date=21 April 2006}}</ref> Until the adoption of the Euro, Vatican coinage and stamps were denominated in their own [[Vatican lira]] currency, which was on par with the Italian [[lira]].

Vatican City State, which employs nearly 2,000 people, had a surplus of 6.7&nbsp;million euros in 2007 but ran a deficit in 2008 of over 15&nbsp;million euros.<ref>[http://www.christiantelegraph.com/issue6216.html Holy See's budget shortfall shrinks in 2008]. ''Christian Telegraph''. The report quoted deals mainly with the revenues and expenses of the Holy See and mentions only briefly the finances of Vatican City.</ref>

In 2012, the U.S. State Department's International Narcotics Control Strategy Report listed Vatican City for the first time among the nations of concern for money-laundering, placing it in the middle category, which includes countries such as Ireland, but not among the most vulnerable countries, which include the United States itself, Germany, Italy and Russia.<ref>Pullella, Philip (8 March 2012).

On 24 February 2014 the Vatican announced it was establishing a secretariat for the economy, to be responsible for all economic, financial and administrative activities of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, headed by Cardinal [[George Pell]]. This followed the charging of two senior clerics including a monsignor with money laundering offenses. [[Pope Francis]] also appointed an auditor-general authorized to carry out random audits of any agency at any time, and engaged a US financial services company to review the Vatican's 19,000 accounts to ensure compliance with international money laundering practices. The pontiff also ordered that the [[Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See]] would be the Vatican's central bank, with responsibilities similar to other central banks around the world.<ref name="VaticanEconomicSecretariat">{{cite news|title=Vatican financial system restructuring begins with new secretariat|url=http://www.theitalynews.net/index.php/sid/220216280/scat/145bb158ac2f80f2/ht/Vatican-financial-system-restructuring-begins-with-new-secretariat|date=25 February 2014|publisher=The Italy News.Net}}</ref>

===Population and languages===
{{Further|Languages of Vatican City}}

[[File:Seal of Vatican City.svg|thumb|right|The Seal of Vatican City. Note the use of the Italian language.]]

Almost all of Vatican City's more than 450<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vaticanstate.va/content/vaticanstate/en/stato-e-governo/note-generali/popolazione.html |title=Vatican City State: Population|year=2017 |website=Vatican City State |publisher=Presidency of the Governorate of Vatican City State |language=English |access-date=7 December 2017}}</ref> citizens either live inside the Vatican's walls or serve in the Holy See's [[List of diplomatic missions of the Holy See|diplomatic service]] in embassies (called "[[Apostolic Nunciature|nunciature]]"; a papal ambassador is a "nuncio") around the world. The Vatican citizenry consists almost entirely of two groups: clergy, most of whom work in the service of the Holy See, and a very few as officials of the state; and the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard|Swiss Guard]]. Most of the 2,400 lay workers who comprise the majority of the Vatican workforce reside outside the Vatican and are citizens of Italy, while a few are citizens of other nations. As a result, all of the city's citizens and places of worship are Catholic.

Vatican City has no formally enacted [[official language]], but, unlike the Holy See which most often uses [[Latin]] for the authoritative version of its official documents, Vatican City uses only Italian in its legislation and official communications.<ref>Vatican City State appendix to the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]] is entirely in Italian.</ref> Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state. In the Swiss Guard, Swiss German is the language used for giving commands, but the individual guards take their oath of loyalty in their own languages: German, French, [[Romansh language|Romansh]] or Italian. Vatican City's official website languages are Italian, English, French, German, and Spanish. (This site should not be confused with that of the Holy See, which uses all these languages, along with Portuguese, with Latin since 9 May 2008 and Chinese since 18 March 2009.)

===Citizenship===
Unlike [[citizenship]] of other states, which is based either on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'' (birth from a citizen, even outside the state's territory) or on ''[[jus soli]]'' (birth within the territory of the state), citizenship of Vatican City is granted ''jus officii'', namely on the grounds of appointment to work in a certain capacity in the service of the Holy See. It usually ceases upon cessation of the appointment. Citizenship is extended also to the spouse, parents and descendants of a citizen, provided they are living with the person who is a citizen.<ref>{{cite web |author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,VAT,3ae6b52f10,0.html |title=Law on Citizenship and Residence, 7 June 1992 |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=7 June 1992 |accessdate=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717160038/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/category,LEGAL,,LEGISLATION,VAT,3ae6b52f10,0.html |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/cittadinanza_it.html |title=Cittadinanza vaticana |publisher=Vatican.va |date=31 December 2001 |accessdate=15 October 2010}}</ref> The [[Holy See]], not being a country, issues only diplomatic and service passports, whereas Vatican City issues normal passports for its citizens.

As of 31 December 2011, other than the pope, there were 594 persons possessing Vatican citizenship, of which:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/press/documentazione/documents/sp_ss_scv/informazione_generale/cittadini-vaticani_en.html|title=Vatican citizenship|accessdate=3 December 2006|publisher=Holy See Press Office}}</ref>

72% were clergy, including:
* 71 cardinals residing in Rome,  
* 307 titular bishops and other clergy serving as papal diplomats, 
* 51 other members of the clergy.

28% were laity, including:
* 1 religious sister, 
* 109 members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard 
* 55 other lay persons.

The persons authorized to reside in the Vatican City maintaining their original citizenship were 238, of the aforementioned numbers.

The persons residing in buildings outside of the Vatican City in buildings exempt from expropriation and taxation were 3,500 on the above-mentioned date.

On 22 February 2011, Pope Benedict XVI promulgated a new "Law concerning citizenship, residency and access" to Vatican City, which became effective on 1 March.

Vatican City is home to some of the most famous art in the world. [[St. Peter's Basilica]], whose successive architects include [[Bramante]], [[Michelangelo]], [[Giacomo della Porta]], [[Carlo Maderno|Maderno]] and [[Bernini]], is a renowned work of [[Renaissance architecture]]. The [[Sistine Chapel]] is famous for its frescos, which include works by [[Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] as well as the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling|ceiling]] and [[Last Judgment]] by [[Michelangelo]]. Artists who decorated the interiors of the Vatican include [[Raphael]] and [[Fra Angelico]].

The [[Vatican Library|Vatican Apostolic Library]] and the collections of the [[Vatican Museums]] are of the highest historical, scientific and cultural importance. In 1984, the Vatican was added by [[UNESCO]] to the List of [[World Heritage Site]]s; it is the only one to consist of an entire state.<ref name="UNESCO">{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/286 |title=Vatican City – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=10 October 2009}}</ref> Furthermore, it is the only site to date registered with the UNESCO as a ''centre containing monuments'' in the "International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection" according to the 1954 [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]].<ref name="UNESCO"/>

''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' is the multilingual semi-official newspaper of the Holy See. It is published by a private corporation under the direction of Roman Catholic laymen, but reports on official information. However, the official texts of documents are in the ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', the [[Gazette|official gazette]] of the Holy See, which has an appendix for documents of the Vatican City State.

Vatican Radio, the Vatican Television Center, and L'Osservatore Romano are organs not of the Vatican State but of the Holy See, and are listed as such in the ''[[Annuario Pontificio]]'', which places them in the section "Institutions linked with the Holy See", ahead of the sections on the Holy See's diplomatic service abroad and the [[diplomatic corps]] accredited to the Holy See, after which is placed the section on the State of Vatican City.

===Pre-Columbian era===
[[File:Hatuey monument, Baracoa, Cuba.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Monument of [[Hatuey]], an early [[Taíno]] chief of Cuba]]
Before the arrival of the Spanish, Cuba was inhabited by three distinct tribes of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The [[Taíno people|Taíno]] (an [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] people), the [[Guanahatabey]] and the [[Ciboney people]].

The ancestors of the Ciboney migrated from the mainland of South America, with the earliest sites dated to 5,000 [[Before Present|BP]].<ref name="AnAofPCC">{{Cite book|title=Art and archaeology of pre-Columbian Cuba|page=22|year=1996|author=Ramón Dacal Moure, Manuel Rivero de la Calle|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-3955-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PEE9oipDYksC&pg=PA22}}</ref>

The Taíno arrived from [[Hispanola]] sometime in the 3rd century A.D. When Columbus arrived they were the dominant culture in Cuba, having an estimated population of 150,000.<ref name="AnAofPCC"/>

The Taíno were farmers, while the Ciboney were farmers as well as fishers and [[hunter-gatherer]]s.

Cuba developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in [[Barbados]]; 300,000 in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], both British colonies; and 450,000 in French [[Saint-Domingue]], which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.<ref name="drimmer">[https://web.archive.org/web/20160705125708/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1919107?seq=1 Melvin Drimmer, "Reviewed Work: ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'' by Herbert S.

The [[Seven Years' War]], which erupted in 1754 across three continents, eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean. Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 [[Battle of Havana (1762)|a British expedition]] of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].<ref name="Siege">Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (2nd edition)''. Chapter One.</ref> When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the underdeveloped sugar plantations.<ref name="Siege"/>

Though Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba. The French had recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.<ref name="Siege"/> Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's other gains in the war]].

The real engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the [[Haitian Revolution]]. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing "pearl of the Antilles" that Haiti had been before the revolution.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107029422|location = New York|pages = 5}}</ref> As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, "At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba.

Although a smaller proportion of the population of Cuba was enslaved, at times slaves arose in revolt. In 1812 the [[Aponte Conspiracy|Aponte Slave Rebellion]] took place but it was suppressed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Matt D.|title=The 1813 Aponte Rebellion in Cuba and the Struggle against Atlantic Slavery|year=2006|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-5772-4|page=320 pages}}</ref>

The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630,980, of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 [[free people of color]] (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves.<ref name = "Scheina 2003 352">{{Harvnb|Scheina|2003|p=352}}.</ref> This was a much higher proportion of free blacks to slaves than in [[Virginia]], for instance, or the other Caribbean islands. Historians such as Swedish Magnus Mõrner, who studied slavery in Latin America, found that [[manumission]]s increased when slave economies were in decline, as in 18th-century Cuba and early 19th-century Maryland of the United States.<ref name="drimmer"/><ref>Magnus Mõrner, ''Race Mixture in Latin America'', Boston, 1967, pp. 124–125</ref>

In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, there had developed the practice of ''coartacion'', or "buying oneself out of slavery", a "uniquely Cuban development", according to historian Herbert S. Klein.<ref>Herbert S. Klein, ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967, p. 196</ref> Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers."<ref name="drimmer"/> A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods.<ref name="drimmer"/>

In the 1820s, when the rest of Spain's empire in [[Latin America]] rebelled and formed independent states, Cuba remained loyal. Its economy was based on serving the empire.{{explain|date=December 2017}} By 1860, Cuba had 213,167 free people of color, 39% of its non-white population of 550,000.<ref name="drimmer"/> By contrast, Virginia, with about the same number of blacks, had only 58,042 or 11% who were free; the rest were enslaved.<ref name="drimmer"/> In the [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] years, after [[Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion]] of 1831, Virginia discouraged manumissions and strengthened restrictions against free blacks, as did other Southern states. In addition, there was a high demand for slaves, and Virginia planters sold many in the internal domestic slave trade, who were shipped or taken overland to the [[Deep South]], which had greatly expanded its cotton production.

Full independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]]. De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba. On 27 December 1868, he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service.{{sfn|Chomsky|Carr|Smorkaloff|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr2hQkCIihMC&pg=PA115 115–7]}} The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the [[Ten Years' War]].

{{Main|Provinces of Cuba|Municipalities of Cuba}}

The country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud). These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: Pinar del Río, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camagüey and Oriente. The present subdivisions closely resemble those of the Spanish military provinces during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas were subdivided. The provinces are divided into municipalities.

Before Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cuba was one of the most advanced and successful countries in Latin America.<ref name="pbs.org">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/e_precastro.html|title=American Experience – Fidel Castro – People & Events |publisher=PBS|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref> Cuba's capital, Havana, was a "glittering and dynamic city".<ref name="pbs.org"/> The country's economy in the early part of the century, fuelled by the sale of sugar to the United States, had grown wealthy. Cuba ranked 5th in the hemisphere in per capita income, 3rd in life expectancy, 2nd in per capita ownership of automobiles and telephones, and 1st in the number of television sets per inhabitant. Cuba's literacy rate, 76%, was the fourth highest in Latin America. Cuba also ranked 11th in the world in the number of doctors per capita. Several private clinics and hospitals provided services for the poor. Cuba's income distribution compared favorably with that of other Latin American societies. However, income inequality was profound between city and countryside, especially between whites and blacks. Cubans lived in abysmal poverty in the countryside.

After the Cuban revolution and before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba depended on Moscow for substantial aid and sheltered markets for its exports. The loss of these subsidies sent the Cuban economy into a rapid depression known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]]. Cuba took limited free market-oriented measures to alleviate severe shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. These steps included allowing some self-employment in certain retail and light manufacturing sectors, the legalization of the use of the [[US dollar]] in business, and the encouragement of [[Tourism in Cuba|tourism]]. Cuba has developed a unique urban farm system called ''[[organopónicos]]'' to compensate for the end of food imports from the Soviet Union. The [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo]] against Cuba was instituted in response to nationalization of U.S.-citizen-held property and was maintained at the premise of perceived human rights violations. It is widely viewed that the embargo hurt the Cuban economy. In 2009, the Cuban Government estimated this loss at $685 million annually.<ref name="dollarsandsense.org">{{Cite web|url=http://dollarsandsense.org/archives/2009/0309pepper.html|title=The Costs of the Embargo {{!}} Dollars & Sense|website=dollarsandsense.org|access-date=18 October 2016}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Cuba}}
[[File:Cuba rel94.jpg|thumb|A general map of Cuba]]
Cuba is an [[archipelago]] of islands located in the northern [[Caribbean Sea]] at the confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[24th parallel north|24°N]], and longitudes [[74th meridian west|74°]] and [[85th meridian west|85°W]]. The United States lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) across the [[Straits of Florida]] to the north and northwest (to the closest tip of [[Key West, Florida]]), and [[the Bahamas]] 21&nbsp;km (13&nbsp;mi) to the north. [[Mexico]] lies 210 kilometers (130 miles) across the [[Yucatán Channel]] to the west (to the closest tip of [[Cabo Catoche]] in the State of [[Quintana Roo]]).

[[Haiti]] is 77&nbsp;km (48&nbsp;mi) to the east, [[Jamaica]] (140&nbsp;km/87&nbsp;mi) and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.

[[File:Sierra Maestra panorama1.jpg|thumb|[[Sierra Maestra]] ]] 
The main island, named Cuba, is {{convert|1250|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|104556|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the largest island in the [[Caribbean]] and [[List of islands by area|17th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1974|m|abbr=on}}).

The second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|2200|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Cuba has an official area (land area) of {{convert|109884|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Its area is {{convert|110860|km2|abbr=on|0}} including coastal and territorial waters.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Cuba}}
[[File:Valle vinales 1.jpg|thumb|[[Viñales Valley]] ]]
With the entire island south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of [[Hong Kong]], which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|°C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|°C|1}} in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] combine to make the country prone to frequent [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]]. These are most common in September and October.

[[Hurricane Irma]] hit the island on 8 September 2017, with winds of 260 kilometres per hour,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/hurricane-irma-landfall-cuba-category-5-170909040746649.html|title=Florida braces for Hurricane Irma after Cuba landfall|website=www.aljazeera.com}}</ref> at the Camagüey Archipelago; the storm reached Ciego de Avila province around midnight and continued to pound Cuba the next day.<ref>https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/hurricane-irma-rips-through-cuba-on-its-way-to-florida/article36221350/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The worst damage was in the keys north of the main island.

===Biodiversity===
[[File:Large group of american crocodiles.jpg|thumbnail|Large group of [[American crocodile]]s in Cuba]]
Cuba signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 12 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 8 March 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |work=cbd.int}}</ref> It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], with one revision, that the convention received on 24 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/cu/cu-nbsap-v2-es.pdf |title=Plan de Acción Nacional 2006/2010 sobre la Diversidad Biológica. República de Cuba |work=cbd.int}}</ref>

The revision comprises an action plan with time limits for each item, and an indication of the governmental body responsible for delivery. That document contains virtually no information about biodiversity. However, the country's fourth national report to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from Cuba, the main groups being: [[animal]]s (17,801 species), [[bacteria]] (270), [[chromista]] (707), [[fungi]], including [[lichen]]-forming species (5844), [[plant]]s (9107) and [[protozoa]] (1440).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/cu/cu-nr-04-es.pdf |title=IV Informe Nacional al Convento sobre la Diversidad Biológica. República de Cuba. 2009 |work=cbd.int}}</ref>

As elsewhere in the world, vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented, so the recorded numbers of species are probably close to the true numbers. For most or all other groups, the true numbers of species occurring in Cuba are likely to exceed, often considerably, the numbers recorded so far.

Indeed, this drop in fertility is among the largest in the Western Hemisphere<ref>{{cite web|year=1997|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/pubsarchive/fer/ffer.htm|title=United Nations World Fertility Patterns 1997|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=9 July 2006}}</ref> and is attributed largely to unrestricted access to legal abortion: Cuba's abortion rate was 58.6 per 1000 pregnancies in 1996, compared to an average of 35 in the Caribbean, 27 in Latin America overall, and 48 in Europe. Similarly, the use of [[contraception|contraceptives]] is also widespread, estimated at 79% of the female population (in the upper third of countries in the Western Hemisphere).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/25s3099.html|title=The Incidence of Abortion Worldwide|author1=Stanley K.

===Ethnoracial groups===
Cuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins. Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread, and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports of the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the [[University of Miami]] determined that 62% of Cubans are black,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821113550/http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html|archivedate=21 August 2013|title=A barrier for Cuba's blacks|publisher=Miami Herald}}</ref> the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population, 65.05%, was white.

In fact, the [[Minority Rights Group International]] determined that "An objective assessment of the situation of [[Afro-Cuban]]s remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging from 34% to 62%".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49749d342c.html|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Cuba: Afro-Cubans}}</ref>

===Immigration and emigration===
{{Main|Spanish immigration to Cuba}}
Immigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile. Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of [[Canarian people|Canarian]], [[Catalans|Catalan]], [[Andalusians|Andalusian]], [[Galician people|Galician]], and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba. Between 1899–1930 alone, close to a million Spaniards entered the country, though many would eventually return to Spain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |title=La inmigración entre 1902 y 1920 |publisher=Tau.ac.il |date= |accessdate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606060146/http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |archivedate=6 June 2009 }}</ref> Other prominent immigrant groups included French,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubagenweb.org/french/index.htm#refugees |title=Etat des propriétés rurales appartenant à des Français dans l'île de Cuba |publisher=Cuban Genealogy Center |date=10 July 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[British people|British]], and [[Irish people|Irish]], as well as small number of descendants of U.S. citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Post-revolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which has led to a [[Cuban exile|large and influential diaspora community]]. During the three decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes — constituting 10% of the total population — [[Cuban migration to Miami|emigrated to the United States]], a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S. from the Caribbean as a whole during that period.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Powell |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VNCX6UsdZYkC&pg=PA68&dq=%22cubans+are+usually+considered+to+be+the+most+successful%22#v=onepage&q=%22cubans%20are%20usually%20considered%20to%20be%20the%20most%20successful%22|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of North American Immigration|pages=68–71|title=Cuban immigration |publisher=Facts on File |date=2005 |accessdate=30 November 2016|isbn=9781438110127 }}</ref><ref name = "Pedraza 2007 ?">{{Harvnb|Pedraza|2007|p=?}}.</ref><ref name = "Falk 1988 74">{{Harvnb|Falk|1988|p=74}}: "[A] tenth of the entire Caribbean population has .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Cuba}}
[[File:2012-Catedral de San Cristobal anagoria 01.JPG|thumb|[[Havana Cathedral]] ]]
In 2010, the [[Pew Forum]] estimated that religious affiliation in Cuba is 65% Christian (60% [[Roman Catholic]] or about 6.9 million in 2016, 5% [[Protestant]] or about 575,000 in 2016), 23% unaffiliated, 17% [[folk religion]] (such as [[santería]]), and the remaining 0.4% consisting of other religions.<ref name=pewrel>{{cite web|title=Religious Composition by Country|url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/globalReligion-tables.pdf|work=Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Forum|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref>

Cuba is officially a secular state. Religious freedom increased through the 1980s,<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|1996|p=105}}: "The expansion of religious liberty began more than a decade ago, for example, and Cuban citizens, by and large, are free to practice their faiths without fear of persecution."</ref> with the government amending the constitution in 1992 to drop the state's characterization as atheistic.<ref name = "Domínguez 2003 4">{{Harvnb|Domínguez|2003|p=4}}.</ref>

[[Roman Catholicism]] is the largest religion, with its origins in Spanish colonization.

The government's relaxation of restrictions on [[house church]]es in the 1990s led to an explosion of [[Pentecostalism]], with some groups claiming as many as 100,000 members. However, [[Evangelical Protestant]] denominations, organized into the umbrella Cuban Council of Churches, remain much more vibrant and powerful.<ref name="Edmonds">{{cite book | last=Edmonds | first=E.B. | last2=Gonzalez | first2=M.A. | title=Caribbean Religious History: An Introduction | publisher=NYU Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-8147-2250-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFQ65RzBm5wC&pg=PA171| page=171}}</ref>

The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly defined by [[syncretisms]] of various kinds. Christianity is often practiced in tandem with [[Santería]], a mixture of Catholicism and mostly African faiths, which include a number of cults. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (the Virgin of ''Cobre'') is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and a symbol of Cuban culture. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess [[Oshun]].

Cuba also hosts small communities of [[Jews]] (500 in 2012), [[Muslims]], and members of the [[Bahá'í]] Faith.<ref>{{cite web|date=13 June 2005|url=http://news.bahai.org/story.cfm?storyid=377|title=Government officials visit Baha'i center|publisher=Baha'iWorldNewsService.com}}</ref>

Cuban music is very rich and is the most commonly known expression of Cuban culture. The central form of this music is [[Son (music)|Son]], which has been the basis of many other musical styles like "[[Danzón]] de nuevo ritmo", [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-chá]] and [[salsa music]]. Rumba ("de cajón o de solar") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Hispanic elements of style.<ref>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robin|title=Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and Artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920–1940|year=1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-5645-7}}</ref>  The [[Tres (musical instrument)|Tres]] was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, [[Neo-Taíno nations|Taíno]] origin, or both, such as the [[maraca]]s, [[güiro]], [[marímbula]] and various wooden drums including the [[mayohuacán]].

Popular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.

During that time, [[reggaetón]] grew in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced "low-profile" airplay of the genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit ''Chupi Chupi'' by [[Osmani García]], characterizing its description of sex as "the sort which a prostitute would carry out."<ref>{{cite web|author=Victor Kaonga, Malawi |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/07/cuba-reggaeton-hit-chupi-chupi-denounced-by-authorities/ |title=Cuba: Reggaeton Hit 'Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities |publisher=Global Voices |date=7 December 2011 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref> In December 2012, the Cuban government officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from radio and television.<ref>{{cite web|author=Scott Shetler |url=http://popcrush.com/cuban-government-censor-reggaeton-sexually-explicit/ |title=Cuban Government to Censor Reggaeton For Being "Sexually Explicit" |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=7 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/cuba-bans-reggaeton-sexually-explicit-songs/story?id=17888666 |title=Cuban Government Censors Reggaeton and "Sexually Explicit" Songs |publisher=ABC News |date=6 December 2012 |accessdate=19 July 2013}}</ref>

[[File:La Havane (1) Tamales pliés.jpg|thumb|Cuban-style tamales]]
Cuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Alvarez|2001}}.</ref> The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.

The typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Moros y Cristianos (food)|moros y cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.

===Literature===
{{Main|Cuban literature}}
Cuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by José Martí, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicolás Guillén]] and [[José Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce María Loynaz]] and [[José Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214100357/http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica – Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}</ref>

[[Alejo Carpentier]] was important in the [[Magic realism]] movement. Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Daína Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Gutiérrez]], [[Zoé Valdés]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.

[http://www.tourism.gov.bt'''Bhutan''' ] is a small country in the [[Himalayas]] between the [[Tibet]] Autonomous Region of [[China]] and [[India]].

Besides the stunning natural scenery, the enduring image of the country for most visitors is the strong sense of culture and tradition that binds the kingdom and clearly distinguishes it from its larger neighbours. Bhutan is the only Vajrayana Buddhist nation in the world, and the profound teachings of this tradition remain well preserved and exert a strong influence in all aspects of life. Due to its pristine environment and harmonious society, the tiny Kingdom of Bhutan has been called "The Last [[Shangrila]]."

==Understand==

Bhutan is a unique country both culturally and environmentally. Perched high in the Himalaya, it is the world’s last remaining Buddhist Kingdom. It has developed the philosophy of Gross National Happiness; where development is measured using a holistic approach of well-being, not just based on gross domestic product.
  
It is still termed as a third world country with subsistence farming practiced in much of Bhutan. In broad terms, the land is fertile and the population small. In addition, the current generation receives free education, and all citizens have access to free, although rudimentary, medical care. The sale of tobacco products is banned and smoking in public areas is an offense punished with fines.

Major sources of income for the kingdom are tourism, hydroelectric power and agriculture.  

While traditional culture has been very well preserved, the opening of the country to TV and internet in 1999 has had a major effect, and modern-day culture is mostly centered on bars and snooker halls. As a result, there is very little or no evidence of quality contemporary art, theatre or music. 

Culturally, Bhutan is predominantly Buddhist with [[Dzongkha phrasebook|Dzongkha]] as a national language (although there are regional variations - such as [[Sharchopkha phrasebook|Sharchopkha]], the predominant language in [[Eastern Bhutan]]), and a common dress code and architectural style. Bhutanese people primarily consist of the Ngalops and Sharchops, called the Western Bhutanese and Eastern Bhutanese, and Lhotshamphas (Southern Bhutanese), a people of Nepalese Gurkha Origin, respectively. The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of their neighbor to the north, Tibet.

Because of the danger of their distinct culture being overwhelmed by Hindu Nepalese immigrants—as had happened in neighboring [[Sikkim]], which ended up being annexed by India—some of whom had been in Bhutan for generations, many were expelled or fled as stateless persons to refugee camps in [[Nepal]].
 
===Gross National Happiness===
This ideology was the brainchild of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck who, having gained a modern education in [[India]] and the [[UK]], realized that mere economic success did not necessarily translate into a content and happy society. Consequently, soon after his coronation in 1974, the young king began to float the idea of developing a new set of guidelines by which to govern the country. Slowly these ideas took shape, and in 1998 the GNH indicator was established. GNH stands for "Gross National Happiness" and is defined by the following four objectives: to increase economic growth and development, preserve and promote the cultural heritage, encourage sustainable use of the environment, and establish good governance. While the concept of GNH receives much international praise and is a major draw for tourists, potential visitors should be aware that the idea is very much in its incubation stage, and there is very little evidence of GNH in the country itself. 

On 19 July 2011, 68 countries joined the Kingdom of Bhutan in co-sponsoring a resolution titled “Happiness: Towards a holistic approach to development,” which was adopted by consensus by the 193-member UN General Assembly.
In follow up to the resolution, the Royal Government of Bhutan convened a High Level Meeting on “Happiness and Well Being: Defining a New Economic Paradigm” on 2nd April 2012 at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
This meeting initiated the next steps towards realizing the vision of a new well being and sustainability-based economic paradigm that effectively integrates economic, social, and environmental objectives. Following this resolution, Bhutan continues to be a champion of the resolution and actively promotes the concept internationally.

===History===
The first humans probably arrived sometime after the Ice Age, and little is known about Bhutan's prehistory. Historical records began with the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th century, when Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) visited Bhutan and established monasteries.  

In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding some border land. Under British influence, a monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations.

In December 2006, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck transferred power to his oldest son, the Crown Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, bestowing upon him the title of the fifth Druk Gyalpo. The official coronation took place in November 2008. The Fifth King is Boston and Oxford educated and is held in high esteem throughout the country.

{{infobox|Guru Rinpoche|It is not possible to travel far in Bhutan without seeing images of a man wearing a tall elaborate hat and with eyes that are open wide and staring forward into space.  This is the great 8th century sage of Vajrayana Buddhism, Padmasambhava or Guru Rinpoche as he often called. According to legend, Padmasambhava was reincarnated into a lotus blossom as an eight-year-old child, and from very young he possessed great wisdom and insight.  Furthermore, he had mastery of the elements and so like a potter manipulating basic clay and turning it into beautiful pots, he was able to transform harmful action and substances into something positive and beneficial. 

Guru Rinpoche's special association with Bhutan began when he traveled to the town now known as [[Jakar]] at the invitation of a local king to subjugate negative forces. The mission was a success, and from this encounter, Buddhism spread throughout the land. A body print of the great sage exists to this day at Kurjey Lhakhang in Jakar, and he is also associated with many other sacred sites in Bhutan, with perhaps the most notable being the cliff-hanging Taktshang Monastery in [[Paro]].}}

===Climate=== 
Although geographically quite small, Bhutan’s weather varies from north to south and valley to valley, mainly depending upon the elevation. In the North of Bhutan on the borders with Tibet, the country is perennially covered with snow. In the western, central and eastern Bhutan (Ha, Paro, Thimphu, Wandue, Trongsa, Bumthang, Trashi Yangtse, Lhuntse) you will mostly experience European-like weather.  Winter lasts here from November to March. Punakha is an exception as it is in a lower valley and summer is hot and winter is pleasant.  Southern Bhutan bordering with India is hot and humid with a sub-tropical climate. While the monsoon affects northern Indian it does not command the same influence in Bhutan.  Summer months tend to be wetter with isolated showers predominately in the evenings only.  Winter is by far the driest period while spring and autumn tend to be pleasant.

There are four distinct seasons similar in their divisions to those of Western Europe. Temperatures in the far south range from 15°C in winter (December to February) to 30°C in summer (June to August). In Thimphu the range is from -2.5°C in January to 25°C in August and with a rainfall of 100mm. In the high mountain regions, the average temperature is 0°C in winter and may reach 10°C in summer, with an average of 350mm of rain.
Precipitation varies significantly with the elevation. The average rainfall varies from region to region.

===Visas===

Bhutan is a unique destination, and as such it has a few unique rules. All tourists, except for citizens of [[Bangladesh]], [[India]] and the [[Maldives]], must obtain a visa before arriving in Bhutan. 

All tourists must book their travel through a local licensed tour operator (or international partner). Visas are applied for online by your local tour operator and it is not required that you visit a Bhutanese Embassy or consulate. Your holiday must be paid in full, via a wire transfer, to the [http://www.tourism.gov.bt Tourism Council of Bhutan] account before a tourist visa is issued. The money remains with the Tourism Council until your travel in-country is complete before the local tour operator is paid.

Visa clearance takes no longer than 72 hours, once full payment has been received. At your point of entry, the visa will be stamped in your passport on payment of USD40, also prepaid through your tour agent. Visa extensions can be obtained through your local tour operator at a cost of Nu.600 (1 Ngultrum = 1 Indian Rupee) and the tourist will also be subject to the daily tariff for the additional days.

As travel to Bhutan almost invariably requires at least one flight change in Bangladesh, [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Singapore]] or [[Thailand]], ensure that you meet the visa requirements of those countries before transiting through. Nepal and Thailand offer visas on arrival or visa waiver for many nationalities. India generally requires visas for most nationalities, though 50 nationalities can obtain an electronic visa online without having to send their passports or visiting an embassy. Check your local Indian embassy/consulate for details.

The total cost for a Bhutanese visa is $250 a day during tourist high season, and $200 a day for low season. This includes basic accommodation, transportation, meals, plenty of bottled water and special entry fees. Discounts apply for minors and larger groups, while surcharges exist for groups smaller than 3. Surcharges also exist for upgrading hotels, transportation, and meals.

The only exceptions for having to book a tour as a condition for being allowed to visit are for those who receive a formal invitation to Bhutan from "a citizen of some standing" or a volunteer organisation, and those who come as guests of the Bhutanese government.

'''Yongphulla Airport''' is located in Trashigang in the east and '''Bathpalathang Airport''' is located at Jakar in the Bumthang district.  From the latter part of 2012 the domestic '''Gelephu Airport''' will go into operation. (This airport is completed but is not consistently in operation for tourist flights.  It is located in the southern central region, close to the Indian border.  [http://www.drukair.com.sg/].

Airline schedules change at least twice per year.  Check the respective airline's website for current schedule.  Be aware flights to Bhutan and within Bhutan are not cheap. Budget about US$1 per mile.

*'''Bagdogra Airport''' (IXB) [http://aai.aero/allAirports/bagdogra_generalinfo.jsp]. Serving the city of [[Siliguri]] in the neighboring [[India|Indian]] state of [[West Bengal]], Bagdogra is a four hour drive from the Bhutanese border town of Phuentsholing. Bagdogra receives frequent flights from major cities within India, and Druk Air operates flights from Bangkok on Sundays and Wednesdays (with out going flights on Tuesdays and Saturdays).

===By car===
There are three land border crossings located along southern border to [[India]] only.  Phuntsholing in the west, Gelephu in the central region and Samdrup Jongkhar in the east.  No border crossings are open along the Chinese northern border.  Road permits are also required; however, these are processed by your local tour operator, along with your visa.  

===By bus===
*'''From [[Kolkata]]''': The Royal Bhutanese Government runs a service to [[Phuentsholing]]. These buses depart from Kolkata's '''Esplanade''' bus station at 7PM on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday and from the [[Phuentsholing]] Bhutan Post office at 3PM on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The journey takes around 18 hours and costs 300Rps/Nu. The buses are comfortable, which is also complemented by the excellent highway connectivity to Kolkata.
*'''From Siliguri''': There is frequent service between Siliguri and [[Phuentsholing]]/[[Jaigaon]]. It is roughly a four hour journey. Buses operated by Royal Bhutan Government depart from across the main highway from the bus station, near Heritage Hotel, at 7:30AM and 1:30PM daily. Tickets cost Rs 62 and are available on entering the bus.
*'''From Phuentsholing''': There are private buses and shared taxis from Phuentsholing to Thimphu but a comfortable option is to book a Bhutan Post bus (Rs/Nu 170) which leaves each morning at 7 AM (Bhutan time) from the post office.

===By train===
There are no railways in Bhutan. The nearest options (both in India) are:

* [[Hasimara]] on the main Kolkata/Siliguri line to Assam is the nearest railway station to Phuentsholing, 17 km away. Indian Rail operated train #13149 and #4084 stop here. As of October 2010, some sections of the road from New Jalpaiguri/Siliguri to Phuentsholing are in a very bad shape. Extending travel by train till Hasimara would save your freshness for Bhutan.

* '''New Jalpaiguri Station''' (NJP) in [[Siliguri]] is a popular choice for travellers heading to Bhutan by land. There are direct shared taxis from NJP to Jaigaon or there is the option of buses from Siliguri bus station. A taxi between the station and the bus station costs around 80rs max. Alternatively you can also take a local train to Hasimara which costs around Rs40 and takes around 3 hours.  Trains from NJP should be booked ahead, as it is a popular stations amongst locals.

At land border crossings you will only get 7 days for [[Paro]] and [[Thimphu]]. For extension of duration apply in Thimphu at the Immigration office at the northern end of Norzin Lam. For visiting other districts you will need to apply for road permits at the same office. They are best applied in the morning and you will receive the document in the afternoon. In case you are defence official without a passport or a student without the above three accepted identification papers, you can request the Indian consulate further up the road to provide you an identification endorsement document but this takes time.

==Get around==

===Permits===
Route permits are required to travel around Bhutan, and there are check posts in most districts east and north of [[Thimphu]] where you are required to produce these documents in order to proceed.  Route permits are processed by your local tour operator on applying for your visa.  These permits are issued by the immigration office in [[Thimphu]] (Northern end of Norzin Lam).

===By bus/car===
The roads that cross the country are characterized by their twists, turns, and steep inclines, but despite the difficult topography, they are generally very well-maintained and safe. Local and inter-district bus services are not very comfortable and stop frequently.  Your local tour operator will provide a vehicle and driver for the duration of your stay.  This cost is included in the daily tariff.  However, traveling by local or inter-district bus or taxi can also be organized.  It is recommended that you drive in Bhutan only if you have experience driving in mountainous regions.  The quality of road surface is variable with endless mountainous hairpin bends.  It is recommended that you pack travel sickness tablets.

The national speed limit is 50 Km per hour. Don't expect to average more than 30 Km per hour.

===Hitchhiking===
As the public transport running between towns in Bhutan is infrequent, [[Tips for hitchhiking|hitching]] is a very common way to get around. The thumb in the air symbol, however, is not recognized, and you will need to flag down a passing vehicle in order to get one to stop. NB: As some drivers pick up passengers as a means of supplementing their incomes, it is customary to offer payment when getting out of the vehicle (the amount depends roughly on the distance, but it will be comparable to the cost of traveling by bus). However, most drivers require nothing, and are more than happy just to have some company and the opportunity to make a new friend. If you plan to hitch a lot (and in some rural areas there is no other way to get around), it is a good idea to take a few small gifts to offer the drivers as an expression of your appreciation. It is generally very safe to hitchhike throughout the country, especially outside of the most urban areas, like Thimphu.

===Roads=== 
Due to the mountainous terrain, roads are frequently blocked by '''rock falls''' during the summer season. Therefore, it is best to avoid traveling long distances from the beginning of June to the end of August. However, if you must travel at this time, carry ample bottled water and snacks as if the '''landslide''' occurs it could take some time to clear the road. 

At an altitude of 3750 meters, the section of road that runs through the '''Thrumshingla Pass''' connecting [[Bumthang]] and [[Mongar]] is the highest in the country and offers some spectacular scenery. However, due to the steep sides of the valley it is especially susceptible to rock falls, so be prepared for long waits during the wet periods in particular.

===Food and refreshment===
While there are ample restaurants on highways between main towns and the hygiene standards at such places is acceptable, the quality of the food is very low and the choice of dishes limited. In addition, the dining halls offer an environment no better than a bus station waiting room. Therefore, it is generally better to prepare food and refreshment for the journey at the point of departure.

==See==

The majority of tourists do "cultural tours" where they visit important destinations.  [[Paro]], [[Thimphu]], [[Punakha]], [[Wangdue]], and [[Jakar]] are popular destinations. Further afield, the unexplored region of Zhemgang (birders paradise, excellent wildlife viewing) and Eastern Bhutan have just been opened up to tourism.  If you are an adventurist and want to explore the unexplored the east of Bhutan is the place for you.  This unique and yet untouched part of the country offers the ultimate experience. 

====Monasteries====
[[Image:Taktsang Monastery, Paro.jpg|thumb|250px|Taktsang Monastery, Paro]] '''Taktsang Monastery''' (Tiger's Nest), [[Paro]]. This is one of the most important Buddhist sites in the world, and Guru Rinpoche visited here in the 8th century on his second visit to Bhutan.  It is the most recognized and visited monument in Bhutan.  It is believed that he arrived on the back of a winged tigress, hence the name, Tigers Nest.  The temple is built on a 1,200 meter cliff and was built in 1692. The hike up to the Tiger's Nest can be very strenuous and you can rent a horse to bring up the mountain, only to the half way point, for about USD $10. The horse ride is a one-way trip (this is recommended if you are not very fit and may face altitude sickness) and you have to make your way down the mountain by foot. Start at 8000' climb to 11,000' and descend to 10,000' to reach Taktsang.  Oxygen, or lack of, is the challenge for sea level dwellers.

For independent travelers, taxis can be arranged to reach Taktsang Monastery. As on May, 2014, a reserved small car will cost you Nu 500 for a round trip and takes about 20 minutes one way. The car will drop you at the site and then will come to pick you up at a later fixed time. 

You can visit Kyichu Lhakhang Monastery on your way to Taktsang.  

Hundreds of monasteries dot the landscape in some of the most pristine and remote areas.  

'''Kurje Lhakhang''', [[Jakar]]. A temple built around a cave with a body print of Guru Rinpoche embedded in the wall. Guru Rinpoche practiced meditation here on his first visit to Bhutan and as such it is the earliest Buddhist relic in the country.

====Dzongs/Fortresses====
Tashichho Dzong is a Buddhist monastery and fortress on the northern edge of the city of Thimpu in Bhutan, on the western bank of the Wang Chu. It has traditionally been the seat of the Druk Desi (or "Dharma Raja"), the head of Bhutan's civil government, an office which has been combined with the kingship since the creation of the monarchy in 1907, and summer capital of the country.[1]
The main structure of the whitewashed building is two-storied with three-storied towers at each of the four corners topped by triple-tiered golden roofs. There is also a large central tower or utse. Built in 1216, Semtokha Dzong in the Thimphu Valley was the first dzong built in the country.   

The '''dzongs''' are ancient fortresses that now serve as the civil and monastic administration headquarters of each district.  Apart from the architecture, which in itself makes a dzong worth visiting, they also hold many art treasures.  
 
Dzongs dot the countryside and were built without the use of cement, nails or plans.  Dzongs which you can visit are:
*Punakha Dzong
*Trongsa Dzong
*[[Jakar Dzong]]
*Lhuentse Dzong
*Simtokha Dzong
*Gasa Dzong
*Rinpung Dzong

====Trekking====
Trekking is also extremely popular.  The Druk path is the most commonly trekked from [[Paro]], to the capital [[Thimphu]].  However, many other more impressive treks are available, see the complete list below.  The Jomolhari, and Laya Gasa trek are also very popular and the Snowman Trek is reported to be one of the toughest treks in the world, taking a approximately 30 days.  The recommended season for this trek is mid-June to mid-October.

====Scenery====
Bhutan pristine environment offers ecosystem which are rich and diverse, due to its location and great geographical and climatic variations, Bhutan’s high, rugged mountains and valleys boast spectacular biodiversity, earning it a name as one of the world’s ten most important biodiversity hotspots.

Recognizing the importance of environment, conservation of its rich biodiversity is one of its development paradigms. The government has decreed that 60% of its forest resources will be maintained for all time through a recently enacted law passed by government.  Today, approximately 72% of the total land area is under forest cover and about 26% of the land area fall under protected areas comprising of four parks. As a result, Bhutan offers a wonderful raw and unexploited environment that is generally very much appreciated by international travelers.     

35% of Bhutan is made up of protected national parks.  Namely, Jigme Singye Wangchuck National Park (1,300 sq.km), TrumshingLa National Park (768 sq. km), Royal Manas National Park (9,938.54 sq. km), Jigme Dorji National Park (4,349 sq. km), Bumdeling Wildlife Sanctuary (1,545 sq. km) and Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary (650 sq. km).

====Festivals====
Festivals or Tshechu (“tenth day”) are another major draw card to Bhutan and are held every year in various temples monasteries and dzongs across the country. The Tshechu is mainly a religious event celebrated on tenth day of a month of lunar calendar corresponding to the birth day of Guru Rinpoche (Guru Padmasambhava). However the month of Tshechu depends place to place and temple to temple.
Tshechus are large social gatherings where people from various villages come together to witness the religious mask dances which are based on incidents from as long as 8th century from the life of Guru Padmasambhava and to receive blessings from lamas. The event also consists of colorful Bhutanese dances and other entertainments.

It is said that everyone must attend a Tshechu and witness the mask dances at least once to receive the blessings and wash away the sins. Every mask dances performed during Tshechu has a meaning or a story behind. In monasteries the mask dances are performed by monks and in remote villages they are performed jointly by monks and village men. Among many Tshechus in the country most popular are Paro and Thimphu Tshechus in terms of participation and audience. Besides the locals many tourists from across the world are attracted to this unique, colorful and exciting culture.

Traditionally, the [[Paro]] and [[Thimphu]] have been the most popular but tourists are fast realizing that the smaller more rural festivals are much more intimate.

==Do==
*'''Trekking:''' Bhutan is a popular place for trekking, though the walks are generally quite tough as there are no places to stay or eat in the higher regions, and so all food and camping equipment must be carried in. The autumn and spring are the best seasons for undertaking a trek. In the summer, the paths are too muddy, while in winter they are snow covered. However, despite the difficulties of the treks, all efforts and discomforts are more than compensated for by the stunning scenery and extremely friendly, gentle and hospitable people that are met along the way. See: [[Wilderness backpacking]].
*'''Festivals:''' Tshechu is the largest religious festival in Bhutan and is celebrated in the late Summer and Fall throughout the country (see city articles for local information), though Thimphu Tshechu is the most famous and attracts around 30,000 people. The highlight of the tshechu ceremonies is the masked dances by monks, which were developed according to precise instructions given by past Buddhist masters. According to Buddhist philosophy, all experiences leave an imprint in the mind stream that  produces a corresponding result in the future, and so viewing these dances, which are imbued with sacred symbolism, is considered to be a very auspicious and sanctifying experience. While the event is not held in a solemn atmosphere and there is much merriment, visitors are reminded that it is still a religious festival that is of great importance to Bhutanese people, and so appropriate behaviour is expected. See [https://www.triip.me/paro/bhutan-culture-4492/ Bhutan Culture] 
*'''Archery''': This is the national sport of Bhutan and competitions are held throughout the country at most weekends. Visitors are very welcome to watch and also to add voice to the boisterous cheering that accompanies these events.
*'''Biking''': There is no better way to experience a place than by bike.  Bhutan's expansive wilderness, small sleepy cities, rural farmland, tiny roads, majestic views, and everything else is that much sweeter on a bike. Biking isn't easy though, being in the Himalayas it requires long climbs at higher altitudes than most travelers are accustom to, followed by long descents down roads rarely wide enough for two cars.  Roads are safe away from major cities, and are mostly smooth and a times feels like a bike lane in the middle of nowhere until a large decorated dump truck comes roving around a tight corner. Biking is easily the most sociable way to and experience Bhutan, locals come up and talk to you, and you have a chance to soak up the settings at your on pace, not that of a rushed driver.  See [http://www.bhutanbybike.com Bhutan by Bike Tour]
*'''Hot Stone Bath''': The hot stone bath is a ritual in itself, riverside rocks are heated till red hot and gradually dropped into a wooden tub filled with water and scattered with Artemisia leaves. The burning rocks heats the water gradually and thus release minerals in to the water. Traditionally these bath are done near a river bed with plenty supplies of stones and water and preferably after dark in the open air.
*'''Ceremonial Buddhist Weddings''':Bhutanese wedding is profound experience and commemorates the celestial union of mind, body and soul of two people. More than just a simple exchange of vows and rings, it entails conducting, set of religious rituals by monks as per Buddhist norms. This rituals signifies the important of bond between partners and importantly bestows upon them the protecting and blessing of Gurus and sentient beings, for a life time of love and happiness. See [http://www.bhutanholiday.bt Wedding and Honeymoon Tour]
*'''Visit and discussion with young Buddhist monks, a Buddhist astrology reading, hike to a secluded nunnery, archery demonstrations, and lunches and cooking demos at local farmhouses can be arranged by special permission only.''' As an international tour operator with a long-term relationship with a Bhutan partner, '''[https://www.boundlessjourneys.com/ Boundless Journeys]''' is able to arrange these things and more for their guests and has personally vetted the hotels, guides, and activities on their Bhutan tours. They take care of the internal flights into the country as well as the visas.

==Talk==

The official language and ''lingua franca'' of Bhutan is '''[[Dzongkha phrasebook|Dzongkha]]''' - a Sino-Tibetan language which is written in the Tibetan script. Dzongkha is the main language spoken in Western Bhutan, with nearly two-dozen other Sino-Tibetan languages being spoken across the country, including [[Sharchopkha phrasebook|Sharchopkha]] in the east and [[Bumthangkha phrasebook|Bumthangkha]] in Bhumthang.
 
Most Bhutanese can also speak [[Nepali phrasebook|Nepali]], which is the native language of most Bhutanese who reside in the south of the country. 

Owing to the presence of Indian media and trade, most people in urban areas also understand English and/or [[Hindi phrasebook|Hindi]].

'''Quotes unique to Bhutan'''

*'''La'''. The suffix 'la' is an '''honorific''', and many Bhutanese feel that their remarks sound too harsh if it is not used, and this carries over even into English. So, don't be surprised if you hear expressions such as "Yes-la" or "I'm not sure-la". It just implies respect. 
*'''Reach'''. In Bhutan, the verb 'reach' means to 'take' or 'accompany' (a person). For example: "I'll reach you to the bus station" means "I'll take/accompany you to the bus station."
*'''Cousin-brother, Cousin-sister'''. Extended families living under one roof are common in Bhutan. As a result, the dividing line between siblings and cousins is blurred, and so it is not uncommon to be introduced to a "cousin-brother" or "cousin-sister". Although these people are just cousins, the English word implies a more distant relationship than is the fact in Bhutan.
*'''BST'''. The exact meaning of this phrase is 'Bhutan Standard Time', but as Bhutanese people are notorious for being late or just not turning up at all, it has taken on the meaning of 'Bhutan Stretchable Time'. Therefore, when someone arrives late, they will often excuse themselves by saying that they are running on BST.

==Buy==

===Currency===

The official currency is the '''ngultrum (Nu.)''', which is pegged 1:1 with the Indian rupee (₹). However, the ₹500 and ₹1000 notes are technically banned by the Bhutanese government, although many local non-governmental establishments accept the ₹500 note. The restrictions on exporting Indian rupees were lifted in 2014 - all nationals may bring an unlimited amount of currency into Bhutan.

US dollars ($) are widely accepted. Bhutanese currency is only needed for expenses personal in nature and buying small souvenir items.

Most ATMs in Bhutan - which are mostly concentrated in Thimphu and Paro - are now compatible with international credit cards such as VISA, MasterCard and Maestro. However, as the service it is not overly reliable, it is good practice to have a supply of ngultrum, rupee or dollar notes.

Failing everything else, banks and major hotels will exchange US dollars for ngultrum and vice versa. Remember to keep your bank exchange receipt to get back dollars.

===Souvenirs===

* '''Woven cloth'''. Bhutanese handwoven fabric is prized around the world, and is available stitched into clothing, wall hangings, table mats and rugs. 
* '''Yathra'''. A brightly coloured woven material made from wool and dyed with natural colours. It is sold in pieces or sewn into jackets, bags, rugs  and wall hangings. ''Yathra'' is available in [[Thimphu]] and other cold areas, but is a specialty of the [[Jakar]] area.  
*'''Dappa'''. Hand made wooden bowls. The halves of the bowl fit tightly together so they can be used to carry cooked food, which is their function in Bhutan. However, they also make excellent salad or cookie bowls. ''Dappa'' are a specialty of the [[Trashi Yangtse (district)|Trashi Yangtse]] region, but can be purchased throughout the country. 
*'''Bangchung'''. Small bamboo woven baskets with two tightly fitting halves. They are a specialty of the southern Bhutan, but available throughout the country.

==Eat==
Rice is a staple with every meal. Vegetable or meat dishes cooked with chili and/or cheese comprise the accompanying cuisine. 

Bhutanese food has one predominant flavour - chili. This small red condiment is not only added to every dish but is also often eaten raw since chillies are considered a vegetable. So, if you don't like spicy-hot food, make this abundantly clear before ordering a meal. Otherwise, you'll be spending the next hour dousing your mouth with cold yogurt or milk. 

Hot-pot and Western European food is now available in some restaurants in Thimphu where French fries, pork or beef ribs, pizza... are served.

===Vegetarian dishes===
*'''Ema-datsi'''. ''Ema'' means chili and ''datsi'' is a kind of cottage cheese, so ema-datsi is a kind of spiced-up Welsh rarebit. 
*'''Kewa-datsi'''. A potato, cheese and chili dish.  
*'''Shamu-datsi'''. A mushroom, cheese and chili dish.

Kewa-datsi and shamu-datsi tend to be less hot than ema-datsi; all three dishes are generally served with rice.

*'''Mutter paneer'''. Though not a Bhutanese dish, this Indian staple of curried peas and cheese is readily available throughout Bhutan and is therefore an additional choice for vegetarians.
*'''Cheese momo'''. A small steamed bun that traditionally contained cheese, cabbage and sometimes onion. However, these days other vegetables, including green papaya, may be substituted for cabbage. 
*'''Khuli'''.  Buckwheat pancakes - a specialty of Bumthang. They are often served with ema-datsi as an alternative to rice.  
*'''Puta'''. A dish of buckwheat noodles usually served with curd - a specialty of Bumthang

'''Imtrat''' run canteens that sell excellent Indian dishes along with tea from 09:30to 16:30. The quality of the food is very good, while the price is low. The canteens are located throughout the country, especially along main highways.

Good Indian vegetarian food in Thimphu is available in few pure vegetarian restaurants located on Norzin Lam, the main street in centre of city. Prices are reasonable.

==Drink==

The legal drinking/purchasing age of alcoholic beverages is '''21'''.

*'''Ara'''. A local spirit brewed from rice or corn. It is popular in rural areas.
*'''Tea'''. Located next to the tea growing regions of Assam and Darjeeling, a steaming cuppa remains the popular drink in Bhutan, with both the butter variety (''suja'') and sweet milk kind (''ngaja'') readily available throughout the country.
*'''Coffee'''. The coffee culture that has swept most of the planet is just beginning to creep into the country. However, for the most part, coffee in Bhutan means the instant variety and it is served simply white or black.
*'''Beer'''. A local raw fresh beer brand name "Red Panda" which is the most fresh and good for tasting.

==Sleep==
All towns connected by motorable roads have hotels, though the standard varies considerably. International standard hotels are mostly found in tourist areas or major towns, while five star accommodation is only available in Paro, Jakar, Punakha, Gangtey and Thimphu.

It is important to note that the hotel rates shown on the city articles are only relevant to people who have residency, visa exemption (generally this only applies to Indian nationals) or who are visiting the country as an invited guest. Other visitors can only enter the  country as part of a tour, for which the daily rates are set by the Bhutanese authorities at around $250 per person per night irrespective of the hotel rates (except for very expensive hotels where a surcharge is added).

==Learn==
'''Buddhism'''
*It is possible to receive instruction on Buddhist practice at any monastery, though for discussions on Buddhist philosophy it is better to consult with the ''khenpos'' or ''loppons'' (teachers) at Buddhist colleges (''shedra''), such as, for example, Lhodrak Kharchhu Monastery in [[Jakar]], Tango Monastery near [[Thimphu]] or Chokyi Gyatso Institute in [[Deothang]]. 
*'''Deer Park Thimphu''' [http://www.deerparkthimphu.org] holds various Dharma related events in the capital, including weekly meditation sessions.      
'''Weaving''' - Bhutanese woven cloth is prized throughout the world for its unique designs and high quality, and there is a weaving centre in [[Khaling]] in [[Trashigang (district)|Trashigang]].

==Work==
There are a few NGOs based in Bhutan, so it is possible to arrange volunteer work. However, Bhutan is very selective about who it engages in this field. In addition, it is highly unlikely that a position can be found while visiting Bhutan, so those interested in undertaking volunteer work here should first seek employment with NGOs overseas and then express a preference to be located in Bhutan.

==Stay safe==
*While drug abuse, gang and domestic violence are common in urban areas, these '''crimes''' are kept within their communities and rarely, if ever, affect tourists. Indeed, Bhutan remains one of the safest places in the world for tourists.
* Police in Thimphu are quite active, they keep doing rounds around the city late nights to ensure safety. 
*'''[[Wilderness backpacking#Stay safe|Bears]]''' are a threat in remote mountainous regions.
*Products containing tobacco (cigarettes, chewing tobacco, etc) are effectively banned throughout Bhutan (which remains the only country in the world to do so) and penalties for possession or use may be severe. One can bring in 200 sticks of cigarettes after paying customs duty at the airport or land entry ports. See [https://www.bookmytour.bt/travel-guide/customs-duty-free Customs and Duty Free].

===LGBT visitors===

'''Homosexuality is illegal with a penalty of one month to one year''', but the law is unenforced.

==Stay healthy==

*Bhutan has a '''universal health care system''' - hospitals and clinics are located throughout the country, even in the remotest areas. However, travellers should not expect hi-tech facilities, and at many of the Basic Health Units the resident doctor is often away. 
*'''Indigenous medical facilities''' are located in all district capitals, with the largest being in [[Thimphu]], so it is also possible to have ailments diagnosed and treated using natural herbal compounds while in Bhutan.
*'''[[Travellers' diarrhea|Waterborne diseases]]''' such as diarrhea, dysentery, giardia and even typhoid are not uncommon in Bhutan, especially during the summer monsoon season. Therefore, ensure that all water has been thoroughly boiled or otherwise purified before consuming.  
*In case of '''[[First aid kit for travellers|emergency]]''', it is advisable to carry first aid material, which might include a few antibiotics and acetaminophen (paracetamol).
*'''[[Altitude sickness]]''' can strike at altitudes as low as 2,500m. Be aware of this before embarking on expeditions in the mountains. If you suffer palpitations, shortness of breath or severe headaches, inform your guide and head to a lower altitude immediately. Take altitude sickness seriously. It can and does kill. 
*The '''[[Travellers' diarrhea|hygiene]]''' standard is acceptable in tourist areas.  However, it is probably wise to prepare medicine for stomach upsets.
*The '''street dog''' population is very high in Thimphu (and to a lesser extent in many of the towns). Most of the animals are extremely docile and there are very few cases of tourists ever being bitten. Still, it is best to err on the side of safety and not to disturb the animals. Moreover, if bitten, immediately receive a rabies vaccination. Although incidences of the disease are uncommon, it inevitably proves fatal if left untreated.
*'''[[Malaria]] and [[Dengue fever]]''' are not common problems in Bhutan, though there are outbreaks in the Indian border regions during the summer monsoon season.

==Respect==
*The '''king and former king''' are accorded a great deal of respect in Bhutan, as is '''Vajrayana Buddhism''' - the state religion. It is wise to bear this in mind when conversing with local people.      
*'''Sacred objects'''. Always pass mani stones, stupas and other religious objects with your right side nearest to the object, and turn prayer wheels in a clockwise direction. Never sit on mani stones or stupas.
*'''Clothing'''. When visiting temples, remove shoes and head gear and wear clothing that expresses respect for the sacred nature of the site. You will need to wear pants and long skirts.
*'''Donations'''. At monasteries, it is custom to make a small donation to the monks as a sign of respect; and also to the Buddhist statues as a means of developing a generous and spacious mind. There are many places in each temple where you can donate, and it is expected that you donate to each place. Remember to have small notes for this gesture. However, this is not mandatory.
*'''Smoking'''. It is illegal to smoke at monasteries and in public places.
*'''Tobacco'''. Products containing tobacco (cigarettes, chewing tobacco etc) are effectively banned throughout Bhutan (which remains the only country in the world to do so) and penalties for possession or use may be severe.

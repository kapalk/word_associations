'''Kyrgyzstan''' (Кыргызстан, officially the Kyrgyz Republic (Кыргыз Республикасы) is a [[South-Central Asia]]n Union country of incredible natural beauty and proud nomadic traditions. Landlocked and mountainous, it borders [[Kazakhstan]] to the north, [[Uzbekistan]] to the west, [[Tajikistan]] to the southwest and [[China]] to the southeast. What would become modern Kyrgyzstan was annexed by [[Russia]] in 1876 and became an independent country with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. It has the most liberal tourist visa policy in Central Asia and one of the more progressive post-Soviet governments in the region.

==Understand==
=== History ===
The ancient Scyths inhabited much of present day Kyrgyz Republic.  With their disappearance the Kyrgyz people moved from Siberia.  The Kyrgyz are descendants of tribes from the [[Tuva]]n region of [[Russia]], which migrated to the area now known as Kyrgyz Republic in the 13th century, during the rise of the Mongol empire. In 1876 the area was incorporated into the Russian empire and later the Soviet Union.  With the tsarist annexation came numerous Slavic immigrants that displaced many of the Kyrgyz and planted crops on their pasture lands.  During World War I, many Kyrgyz refused to support the tsarist troops and many were massacred.  

Following the creation of the Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan changed dramatically as industrialization took over and brought factories, mines, and universities.  The Soviet influence on Kyrgyzstan was strongly felt and many of the pre-Soviet traditions and cultures were lost and are only being recently rediscovered.  In addition, ethnic minorities were deported to Kyrgyzstan, including Germans, Kurds, Chechens, Poles, and Jews.  In addition, Ouighur and Dungan Chinese Muslims settled in Kyrgyzstan.  This mix of populations makes Kyrgyz Republic one of the most ethnically diverse populations in Asia.

August 31st, 1991 marked a major event in the history of Kyrgyzstan. After unrest in various regions throughout the Soviet Union, a coup in Moscow against the regime of Mikhail Gorbachev failed. This move against the central government motivated the Kyrgyz power structure to declare independence from the U.S.S.R. Kyrgyzstan also saw during that time the election of the only non-communist party backed president in the Central Asian region, a physicist named Askar Akayev. 

As for President Akayev, it became evident that non-party affiliation did not guarantee honesty. The executive branch’s power increased through suppression of opposition and the President secured immunity from prosecution for himself and his family. After several years of questionable elections, in March 2005, massive groups of protesters from around the country converged on the capitol, causing Akayev to flee into exile in Russia.

The leader of the Tulip Revolution, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, formed an interim government and served as president and prime minister until later that July when emergency elections were held. Bakiyev ran for the office of President and won, but was unable to gain parliamentary approval of his cabinet until five months later. After several attempts to resolve a constitution, Bakiyev declared in 2007, that all previous versions of the constitution were illegal and instituted a modified constitution from the Akayev era. He then dissolved parliament and called for an early election to reform the parliamentary structure. The President’s own party gained the majority and the U.S. State Department expressed deep concern about the conduct of the elections, citing several issues including widespread vote count irregularities and exaggerations in voter turnout. Some of the current problems that Kyrgyzstan faces today are universal throughout the Commonwealth of Independent States, namely lack of political freedom, widespread corruption and negative influences on democracy.

===Climate===
Dry continental to polar in high Tien Shan; subtropical in southwest (Fergana Valley); temperate in northern foothill zone.

===Landscape===
Entirely mountainous, dominated by the Tien Shan range; many tall peaks, glaciers, and high-altitude lakes.  Highest point: Jengish Chokusu (Pik Pobedy) 7,439 m. The mountains are beautiful for hiking.

==Regions==

Due to the presence of several mountain ranges, Kyrgyzstan can also be divided into northern and southern regions. The northern (and cooler) region consists of Chui, Issyk-Kul, Talas, and Naryn oblasts. While the southern (and warmer) region contains Jalalabad, Osh. and Batken. The southern half of Kyrgyz Republic is also part of the Fergana Valley, a fertile agricultural region shared by Kyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan.

==Get in==
Citizens of all countries, including Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, may apply for tourism, business and group tourist types of visa for 30 or 90 days online through the Kyrgyz Republic eVisa system. Evisa holders must arrive via Manas International Airport, Osh International Airport and Ak-jol checkpoint on the Kyrgyzstan-Kazakhstan border.

As of July 27, 2012, citizens from 44 nations may visit Kyrgyzstan visa-free for up to 60 days. What follows below is the content of a letter distributed by the Kygyzstan embassy in Urumqi:

<b>Notice for foreign tourists</b>

President of the Kyrgyz republic signed the Law "On introduction of visa free regime for citizens of some countries up for to 60 days." the law was adopted in order to simplify procedures for issuing visas to foreign citizens and increase the attractiveness of the tourism market, tourism development and investments.

<i>The law was entered in force on July 27, 2012.</i>

Citizens of the countries listed below intending to visit Kyrgyzstan up to 50 days do not need obtaining entry visa to Kyrgyzstan:

The list of countries:

Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Kuwait, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, Vatican City

===By plane===

Bishkek's Manas Airport has daily flights to Istanbul, Moscow, and London (via Almaty).  In addition there are several flights a week to regional hubs in Tashkent, Urumqi and a weekly service to Dubai.  The airport is situated approximately 30 km north of the city center.  The airport is modern, efficient and features a VIP Hall that facilitates entry and exit if you need more comfortable services.

A visa on arrival can be issued at the airport for nationalities of many countries.

A taxi to and from the city center can be arranged for approximately 700 soms, but prepare to negotiate from a much higher price.  Note that most international flights arrive in the very early morning hours, so the taxi drivers will demand a higher price based upon the late or early hours.

===Flights from India===


Direct Flights have now started from Delhi International Airport (IGIA-T3) to Bishkek. Air Manas Air Company runs 2 flights weekly to Bishkek.

===By train===

Trains to Bishkek depart from Moscow (Kazanskaia station) a few times a week (3714km, trip takes more than 3 days) going through Kazakhstan (Kazakh transit visa is required for most of non-CIS travelers). Details can be found at poezda.net [http://www.poezda.net/en/index] or rzd.ru [http://pass.rzd.ru/] (the second one available only in Russian and contains current ticket prices which were about 166EUR in 2013 for "plackartniy" class). On the train it is forbidden to carry portable stove fuel cans.

===By car===

Driving in Kyrgyzstan is by Western standards dangerous.  However, the government has invested very heavily in reconstructing a core network of roads that now rival the highways in many western nations.  The principal highway from Bishkek to Osh is an engineering marvel through the mountainous region. However it is beginning to deteriorate and is badly potholed in several areas.  Further, the highway from Osh to the Chinese border at [[Irkeshtam]] and from the village of [[Sary Tash]] to the [[Tajikistan]] border is being reconstructed in stages to international standards.  Many other highways are likewise being rehabilitated as funding permits.  In addition, the maintenance roads that feed into the core network are being improved as funds become available.  Likewise, maintenance is being privatized on an experimental basis. This is not to say that driving in the Republic is easy.  But given the limited economic resources progress is being made.  

In the cities and outlying areas locals have become used to missing road drain covers, dry dusty roads (where water tankers sometimes sprinkle water to keep dust down) and generally bad roads that are not effectively maintained. 

Interesting usage of main and large roads: If your side is too damaged to drive fast then is quite normal to use the other side of the road. 

If you get stopped by the police it's likely to cost some money. 

Rental cars and motorcycles are available from a few companies now. Prices range from around $40 for an economy car to well over $200 for a luxury SUV.

From Kazakhstan, the road from Almaty to Bishkek is the busiest. The border at Kegen may be more difficult to get across. Frequent and obvious smuggling happens in this border and it's quite obvious that the immigration and the border guards are in cahoots with the smugglers. Visa on arrival is not possible here and if coming from Kazakhstan, make sure you have at least a double-entry/multiple entry visa for Kazakhstan in case of troubles with Kyrgyz border officials. If you are a holder of a passport of a country that is visa free to Kyrgyzstan you can cross without problems. 

Watch out for mini buses pulling out too.

'''Journey times''':

* From [[Kazakhstan]] to Bishkek - from [[Almaty]] which takes 5 hours and from Taraz which takes 5 hours.
* From [[Uzbekistan]] to Bishkek, the road goes through Kazakhstan and drive would take more than 10 hours, and to Osh in the south
* From [[Tajikistan]] to Osh the road from Khudjant (Tadjikistan) and through [[Batken]] (Kyrgyzstan) further to Osh. The road is one of the most difficult to drive. The main road goes through the Uzbek enclaves but there is also an alternative way around the enclaves. If taking a taxi, remind the driver to go around the small bit of Uzbekistan. There is also a road from Khorog to Osh.
* From China there two passes - Irkeshtam leading to Osh and Torugart leading further to Naryn.

===By bus===
Minibuses between Bishkek and Almaty operate from many of Bishkek bus stations, including Almatenskaya Station.  There is also a bus between Osh and Kashgar.


===Border crossings===
Border from Kazakhstan @Kegen, as its on a mountain pass, is closed in in winter or in snowy weather so you need to call the border control center in Karakol to check if it is open... ask some one who speaks Russian to call for you... +996 (0)3922 56122

== Get around ==

=== Flights ===
There are several daily flights between [[Bishkek]] and [[Osh]].  There are also a few flights a week between [[Bishkek]] and [[Jalalabad]] and [[Batken]]. The flights are operated on local airlines using 30-40 year old soviet planes. On the other hand, the mechanics and pilots are well trained how to operate these old beasts.

=== By train ===
The only domestic rail link is between Balykchy (Western edge of Issyk Kul) to Tokmok through to [[Bishkek]] through to Karabalta and on to the Kazakh border.  The trains take at least twice as long as a taxi, but are half the price and you get to meet a lot of interesting folks, mostly pensioners, that need the 40-80 soms they would save by taking a mini-bus or taxi.

=== Buses and Taxis ===

Minibuses (marshrutkas) and shared taxis are the most common and accessible option for travelling within Kyrgyzstan. They're inexpensive and congregate at every village centre or bus station. You can also arrange a private taxi by purchasing all the seats at the bus station or contacting a taxi firm directly.

The prices for mini-buses are set and straight-forward, but it won't generally leave until it is full and you may be asked to have  a child in your lap. With shared taxis you will be quoted a price for one seat and if you have significant luggage you should expect to pay for an extra or partial seat. You should negotiate prices, but as a foreigner you will likely pay more than a local. Another option that is developing is [http://www.ihn.kg Iron Horse Nomads]: they offer a service between Cholpon Ata and Bishkek with pre-purchased tickets for 700 soms. which is2-3x the price of a Marshrutka and just a bit more than a taxi.

=== Biking ===
Kyrgyzstan is popular with long distance bike treks, particularly around Issyk Kul and passes through the southern mountains to [[Tajikistan]].

=== Wintersports ===
There are more than 20 ski resorts in Kyrgyzstan, and the list is growing, thanks to the excellent winter conditions. You can get updated information and a complete Snow Report online. 
Heliskiing in Kyrgyzstan is a secret tip for freeriders all over the world. Eurosolutions is organized by Germans and provides different packages.

=== Hitchhiking ===
The concept of ''free rides'' is not really understood here. A lot of locals hitchhike and pay for the ride. So particularly if you happen to be a foreigner you are expected to pay for the ride. Most drivers will expect you to pay for the petrol. You can try to explain that you do not want to pay, the russian phrase ''Bez deneg'' can be used but prior to using the ride.

If the driver is asking for too much money you can always haggle! As a rule of thumb you should either pay more than if you had paid a bus but less than if you had paid a taxi.

=== Horseback ===
This is the real way to see Kyrgyzstan by the saddle of a horse.  There are several tourist agencies that can make it happen for you, as the Kyrgyz are famous horsemen dating back to the days of Ghengis Khan.  It is said that all Kyrgyz are born on a horse, although with growing urbanization that seems to be less common.

=== Driving ===
Tourists renting a private car and driving in Kyrgyzstan is becoming more and more popular. The roads are getting better and the police are becoming friendlier toward tourists and treat them better than they do locals. One problem remains: auto insurance isn't common (London-Bishkek/Jubilee and Kyrgyzstan Strahovka do provide insurance). 

Rental Companies:
* <listing name="OcOO Iron Horse Nomads" alt="IHN" phone="+996 555 800 278" email="travel@ihn.kg" url="http://ironhorsenomads.com" price="USD25-120"></listing>
* <listing name="Travel Land Kyrgyzstan"  phone="+996 700 900 838" email="rent@trvlland.com" url="https://carrent.trvlland.com"  price="USD 18-95"></listing>

Hiring a taxi is easy and cheap, making this a good option. Most long-term expats drive, though some opt to use a driver.

== Talk ==

The languages of Kyrgyzstan are [[Russian phrasebook|Russian]] and [[Kyrgyz phrasebook|Kyrgyz]], a Turkic language related to Uzbek, Kazakh, and, of course, Turkish. Kyrgyz is more common in rural areas whereas Russian is the urban language of choice (in fact it's not uncommon to meet ethnic Kyrgyz people in Bishkek who cannot speak Kyrgyz). English, while becoming more popular, is still rarely spoken, so in order to effectively communicate one must at the very least learn a few basic words (yes, no, please, thank you, etc.) in Russian or Kyrgyz, depending on the location. If you are lost completely, try to ask young people, especially students.

Like most of the rest of the former Soviet Union, Kyrgyzstan uses the Cyrillic alphabet, which can present a problem for Western travellers. However, the characters are not too hard to learn and once that is done you'll find that many of the words are familiar. For example, "ресторан" in latin is "restoran," which means, "restaurant." But be careful. They use it for Kyrgyz language as well!

See the Wikitravel [[Russian phrasebook]] and [[Kyrgyz phrasebook]] for more information.

==Buy==

=== Cash ===
The official currency in Kyrgyzstan is the som (sometimes written as 'сом' or abbreviated as 'с' in Cyrillic). The ISO 4217 code is '''KGS''', placed before the amount and without a space in our guides. 

The som is divided into 100 ''tyin''. Banknotes are issued in 10 tyin, 50 tyin, KGS1, KGS5, KGS10, KGS20, KGS50, KGS100, KGS200, KGS500, KGS1,000, and KGS5,000 denominations. 

Coins are available in 10 tyin, 50 tyin, KGS1, KGS3, KGS5 and KGS10 denominations.

Changing money is relatively straightforward. Banks will accept a variety of major currencies, while the money-changing booths that are ubiquitous in urban areas will typically only deal with US dollars, pounds sterling, euros, Russian rubles, and Kazakh tenges. Note that neither banks nor money changers will accept any foreign currency that is torn, marked, excessively crumpled, or defaced in any way, so be sure to carefully check any notes you intend to bring into the country for defects.

=== Credit Cards & ATMs ===
Like other countries in [[Central Asia]], Kyrgyzstan is overwhelmingly a cash economy. Credit cards are rarely used. 

ATMs are common in [[Bishkek]], and there are a scattering of ATMs in other towns.  Many accept Visa - only Kazkommerts bank accepts Mastercard / Maestro / Cirrus, and their ATMs are few are far between. You can withdraw US Dollars or Kyrgyz som at many ATMs.

===Costs===

==Eat==
Kyrgyz food is the product of a long history of pastoral nomadism and is overwhelmingly meat-based. And if we are saying overwhelmingly, it means really overwhelmingly. Those with vegetarian fixations may wish to revise their habits, purchase their own fresh fruits, vegetables, and fresh bread from one of the many small stands or food bazaars that are ubiquitous in every city, eat in Chinese restaurants or stay with bread and tea only.  While people from the West are programmed to think of large vegetables as desirable, small and flavourful is the rule here. Same is valid for pistachios, almonds as well. Washing vegetables before consumption is recommended.

Besh barmak (“five fingers”) is the national soupy dish of Kyrgyzstan (Kazakhs would probably disagree). For preparation, a sheep or horse is slaughtered and boiled in a large pot. The resulting broth is served as a first course.  The meat is then divided up between those at the table.  Each person in attendance receives the piece of meat appropriate to their social status.  The head and eyes are reserved for guests of honor.  The remaining meat is mixed in with noodles and, sometimes with onions, and is traditionally eaten from a large common dish with the hands, although nowadays more often with a fork or spoon. Kyrgyz people like soupy food in general, those food that are served as kind of pasta in Russia (pelmeni), they prefer it as soup.

Most other dishes encountered in Kyrgyzstan are common to the other countries of Central Asia as well.  Plov or osh is a pilaf dish that at a minimum includes julienne carrots, onion, beef or mutton, and plenty of oil, sometimes raisins.  Manti are steamed dumplings that normally contain either mutton or beef, but occasionally pumpkin.  Samsa are meat (although sometimes vegetable or cheese) pies that come in two varieties: flaky and tandoori.  Flaky somsa are made with a phyllo dough while tandoori somsa have a tougher crust, the bottom of which is meant to be cut off and discarded, not eaten.  Lagman is a noodle dish associated with Uyghur cuisine, but you can find everywhere from Crimea to Ujgurs.  Most of the time it is served as soup, sometimes as pasta. The basic ingredients of lagman (plain noodles and spiced vegetables mixed with mutton or beef) can be fried together, served one on top of the other, or served separately. Shashlik (shish kebabs) can be made of beef, mutton, or pork and are normally served with fresh onions, vinegar and bread

Almost all Kyrgyz meals are accompanied by tea (either green or black) and a circular loaf of bread known as a lepeshka. The bread is traditionally torn apart for everyone by one person at the table. In the south of Kyrgyzstan, this duty is reserved for men, but in the north it is more frequently performed by women.  Similarly, tea in the north is usually poured by women, while in the south it is usually poured by men.  

At the end of a meal, Kyrgyz will in some cases perform a prayer. Sometimes some words are said, but more often the prayer takes the form of a perfunctory swipe of the hands over the face.  Follow the lead of your host or hostess to avoid making any cultural missteps.

==Drink==
Drinking is one of the great Kyrgyz social traditions. No matter if you are served tea, kymys, or vodka, if you have been invited to a Kyrgyz person's table to drink, you have been shown warm and friendly hospitality. Plan to sit awhile and drink your fill as you and your host attempt to learn about each other.

===Drinking tea===
When offered tea, you might be asked how strong you want it. Traditionally, Kyrgyz tea is brewed strong in a small pot and mixed with boiling hot water to your desired taste. If you want light tea, say 'jengil chai'. If you want your tea strong and red, 'kyzyl chai'. You might notice that they don't fill the tea cup all the way. This is so that they can be hospitable and serve you lots of tea. To ask for more tea, 'Dagy chai, beringizchi' (Please give tea again). Your host will happily serve you tea until you burst. So once you've truly had your fill and don't want to drink any more, cover your tea cup and say, 'Ichtym. yrahmat' (I've drunk. thank you). Your host will offer a few more times (and sometimes will pout if you say no), this is to make sure that you are truly satisfied. Once everyone at table has finished drinking tea, it is time to say, 'Omen', and hold your hands out palms up and then brush the open palms down your face.

===Vodka===
When entering a local store, you might goggle at the amount of vodka on display. Introduced by the Russians, vodka has brought much joy and sorrow to the Kyrgyz over the years. Most vodka you will find for sale was made in Kyrgyzstan and can provide travellers with one of the worst hangovers known, mainly if you buy one of cheaper ones. But for approx €2 you can have good Kyrgyz vodka, ex. Ak-sai. Some professional vodka drinkers say that this is because foreigners don't know how to properly drink vodka. To drink vodka in the right way, you need to have zakushkas (Russian for the meal you eat with vodka). This can consist of anything from simple loaves of bread to full spreads of delicious appetizers. Quite common are sour or fresh cucumbers, tomatoes, and of course meat. That's called "bata".

First, find someone to drink with. Only alcoholics drink alone. Second, choose your vodka, the more you spend... the less painful your hangover. Third, choose your zakuska, something salty, dried, or fatty. This is so that the vodka is either absorbed by the food or repelled by the fat. Fourth, open your bottle... but be careful, once you open it you must drink it all (a good vodka bottle doesn't have a cap that can be replaced), now pour your shots. Fifth, you will toast! You must toast! Toast your friends, toast their futures, toast their sheep, toast their cars. Sixth, drink! Drink it all! Now chase it with a zakuska and repeat until you can't see the bottle or it is empty. 

If you are drinking with locals its not problem to skip round. They would just pour you a symbolic drop and when they are clinking glasses you have to use your right hand and slap sparing partners glasses slightly instead of your glass.

===Traditional drinks===
The Kyrgyz for generations have made their own variety of beverages. At first, these drinks might seem a bit strange, but after a few tries they become quite tasty. Most are mildly alcoholic, but this is just a by-product from their fermentation processes.

In the winter, Kyrgyz wives brew up ''bozo'', a brew made of millet. Best served at room temperature, this drink has a taste somewhere between yogurt and beer. On cold winter days, when you are snowed in, five or six cups gives you a warm fuzzy feeling.

In the spring, it is time to make either ''jarma'' or ''maxym''. Jarma, a wheat based brew, has a yeasty beerlike quality but with a gritty finish (it is made from whole grains after all). Maxim, a combination of corn and wheat, has a very sharp and zesty taste. It is best served ice cold and is a great pick me up on hot days.

Summer sees yurts lining the main street selling ''kymys'', fermented mares milk. Ladled out of barrels brought down from the mountains, this traditional drink is one of the more difficult to get used to. It has a very strong and pungent foretaste and a smoky finish. Kymys starts off as fresh horses milk (known as samal), the samal is then mixed with a starter based on strong mature kymys. The mixture is poured into the wineskin for kymys "saba" made out of the skins of sheep, a horse or a bull on ancient technology and the milk is whipped with a special tool "Bishkek" to ferment for a period. 

''Tang'' is another drink thought to be useful for the health and good for hangovers. It is made from gassed spring water that is mixed with a salted creamy yogurt called ''süzmö''.

===Other drinks===
Kyrgyz have their own cognac distiller, which produces excellent, albeit highly sweet cognac, with the preferred brand being "Kyrgyzstan Cognac", which the locals sometimes call ''Kyrgyz Cognagy''.

You can also find an excellent selection of not so excellent local and imported beers as many Kyrgyz have been taking to drinking beer versus harder spirits. Locally produced beers include Arpa, Nashe Pivo, and Karabalta. Arpa is highly recommended by beer connoisseurs. While being considered a common person's beer, its style is somewhat similar to an American Pale Ale (less hoppy than its Indian counter-part). Due to the fact that Kyrgizes prefer more vodka than beer (actually, half litre of both costs the same...), beer is staying in tubes for longer time. Regular cleaning service is not common. Bottled beers are better, except their strange habit to pour all the beer into the glass at once.

There are also a multitude of bottled waters (carbonated or still) from various regions of the country.  Especially popular with southerners is the slightly saline "Jalalabad Water".

==Sleep==
Many private citizens rent out their flats to foreigners and a fairly luxurious flat could be agreed for quite low price a week. Noting that the average salary was $44 in 2004, now it could twice as big, you may think you are paying excessively. Look for cable, toilet and bath, and clean quarters. More adventurous visitors may wish to stay in a "yurta," for example in Bishkek it costs from 3 dollar a night in "yurtadorm". These are boiled wool tents used by nomads. Some tourist agencies in Bishkek will arrange this sort of stay, but be prepared to truly live the lifestyle of the nomad which includes culinary delicacies which may seem foreign to the western palate.

==Learn==
For those who are interested in learning Kyrgyz or Russian languages - there are universities you can go and there is a private schools called the  [http://www.ruscourse.com Kallan School] and London School. The  Schools in Bishkek offers pretty cheap individual lessons for about $4/hour and home stay/cultural programs.

==Work==
In Kyrgyzstan there are few opportunities for foreigners, except with development organizations, that generally hire off-shore. There are also few opportunities to teach European languages, as many Kyrgyz that studied abroad have returned with near fluency and will be able to communicate with students in their language and at more accessible prices.

If you wish to volunteer, there is a very active and diverse NGO community that would appreciate your assistance.

If you come to Kyrgyzstan on a 30 day tourist visa, you will not be able to extend your visa. If you come to work or volunteer you should apply for a longer term visa.  Also, Americans and Europeans on long term visas must register with OVIR.  Information on this process is available on the websites of the US Embassy.  It is an easy, inexpensive, straight-forward process not fraught with corruption or delays in most cases.

You could also work for local language schools. [http://www.thelondonschool.org The London School in Bishkek] and [http://www.ruscourse.com The Kallan School in Bishkek] are usually good for working as a TEFL teacher or learning Russian and Kyrgyz languages.

==Stay safe==
Kyrgyzstan is constantly engulfed in strifes and political turmoil, and several countries advise foreigners to not travel to Kyrgyzstan at this time. 

While the US travel advisory tells foreigners that some attacks on Westerners have occurred, the view of Kyrgyz people on this is varied. Fights and assaults generally focus around nightclubs and bars, just as in any other large city. There is to date no indication that Bishkek is particularly dangerous to foreigners. As for other cities in the Kyrgyz Republic, there is little evidence. Tourists will of course be drawn by Kyrgyzstan's amazing natural beauty although travel by car through mountain passes and villages is not advisable. 

In the past there have been occasional reports of foreigners being approached by persons impersonating police and asking for documents in order to find an excuse to extort monies.  These reports are uncommon, but one should always be on guard.

=== Corruption ===
Corruption is a serious issue in Kyrgyzstan, and the locals are ultimately convinced that the police are not to be trusted. Many officers will stop and ask for a bribe.

==Stay healthy==
Your biggest risk in Kyrgyzstan are car wrecks and accidents while crossing the street or falling into a hole in the sidewalk.  You should also exercise caution around stray animals and avoid approaching dogs.

Food and drinking water safety vary substantially by region.  Kyrgyz claim the national drink, Kumys, is extremely healthy and will cure you of innumerable ailments.

On August 27, 2013, a case of bubonic plague was reported in north-eastern Kyrgyzstan.

==Cope==

A popular local source of information for tourists is the regularly published ex-pat run Spektator [http://www.thespektator.co.uk] magazine which features tourism and culture articles focusing on Kyrgyzstan and the wider Central Asian region.

==Respect==
Western norms of respect are standard. Though nominally a Muslim country the Kyrgyz people are highly westernized. No special dress codes are in effect. Although standards of dress in Bishkek are Western and often revealing, in the south of the country women would be advised to dress more conservatively or risk attracting unwanted male attention. Evenings can be charged, as alcohol intoxication can be quite prevalent at this time. Proceed with caution.

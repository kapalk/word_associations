The [http://www.bruneitourism.travel/ Sultanate of '''Brunei'''] (''Negara Brunei Darussalam'') officialy ''Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace'' is a small but - thanks to natural gas and petroleum resources - very rich country located in [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] [[Asia]]. It's surrounded by [[Malaysia]] and has two parts physically separated by Malaysia, almost being an enclave. Strategically located on the South China Sea, close to vital sea lanes linking Indian and Pacific Oceans, it has an exclusive economic fishing zone that extends as far as Louisa Reef in the southern [[Spratly Islands]] although it makes no public territorial claim to the offshore reefs.

==Understand==
Brunei is a pint-sized and fabulously wealthy oil-rich sultanate with a population of just under half a million, if illegal immigrants from countries such as Indonesia, India, China and the Philippines are included. 

It is a member of the Commonwealth and has good education and hygiene. 

The population is devoutly Muslim.

===History===
The Sultanate of Brunei's heyday occurred between the 15th and 17th centuries, when its control extended over coastal areas of northwest [[Borneo]] and the southern [[Philippines]]. Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate. It was offered the opportunity to join Malaysia as a state in 1963, but opted out of the Federation due to a disagreement on the amount of its oil income that would have to be given to the central government in Kuala Lumpur. Independence was achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six centuries.

===Economy===
The backbone of Brunei's economy is '''oil and gas''' and the Sultan of Brunei is, famously, one of the richest people in the world with an estimated personal wealth of around 40 billion dollars.  Per capita GDP is far above most other developing countries, and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides for all medical services, housing, education and subsidizes daily needs like rice.

All sectors of economy are fairly heavily regulated and government policy is an odd mixture of subsidies, protectionism and encouragement of entrepreneurship.  Brunei's leaders are attempting to balance the country's steadily increasing integration into the world economy with internal social cohesion. It became a more prominent player in the world by serving as chairman for the 2005 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Plans for the future include upgrading the workforce, reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and tourist sectors, and, in general, widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.
__TOC__
===Culture===
Brunei is officially an '''Islamic''' state, with hundreds of large beautiful mosques across the country.  Sale of alcohol is '''banned'''. Bringing in meat, (other than seafood) which has not been certified "halal", (slaughtered according to Islamic law), is also banned.  

During the fasting month of Ramadan, many shops and restaurants will be open. However, eating, drinking or smoking in front of people who are fasting is considered rude and asking permission is appropriate. In 2014, '''new law''' had been passed by the government where non-fasting people '''only''' allowed to '''take-out foods from all restaurants''' and eat privately. This due to the respect of the Holy Month in Islam.

The bulk of the population is '''Malay''' (67%) and there is also a significant '''Chinese''' minority of some 15% as well as a number of indigenous peoples, including the '''Dusun''' tribes who inhabit the jungle upriver and the '''Temburong''' district, (the smaller eastern part detached from the rest of Brunei).  There is a large number of '''foreign workers''' who work on the oil and gas production or in positions such as restaurant staff, field workers and domestic staff. The male to female ratio is 3:2. More than a quarter of the people are short term immigrant workers, most of whom are men.

===Geography and climate===
The climate of Brunei is tropical equatorial. The average annual temperature is 26.1°C (79.0°F), with the April–May average of 24.7°C (76.5°F) and the October–December average of 23.8°C (74.8°F).

Brunei's topology is of a flat coastal plain rises to mountains in the east, the highest point being '''Bukit Pagan''' at 1,850m, with some hilly lowlands in the west.

There are no typhoons, earthquakes, severe flooding and other forms of natural disasters to contend with, and the biggest environmental issues is the seasonal '''haze''' resulting from forest fires (that is caused by illegal clearing of land) in nearby Indonesia.

==Regions==
Brunei has four districts (Malay: ''daerah'')

Nationals of [[China]] (PRC), [[Qatar]] and [[Taiwan]] may obtain a single entry visa for a fee at Brunei International Airport valid for 14 days.

Proof of return or onward travel is required to check in for your flight to Brunei. If you plan to leave by ferry you will need to purchase a cheap flight out of Brunei before you arrive there.

Those who need a visa must apply in advance at a Brunei embassy, where processing can take up to 3 days and costs B$20 for a single entry visa. See Brunei Immigration Department [http://www.immigration.gov.bn/visiting.htm] for the latest details.  

Apply for the visa in Kota Kinabalu: It costs 70 RM and takes 3 working days. Time to receive application is 8.30am-11.30am (Monday-Friday). Time of collection is 2.30pm-3.30pm (Monday-Friday). My argentinian friend asked for the visa on Monday and was able to collect it on Wednesday before 11.30am. The Consulate of Brunei is in Grace Square. You need one photo and proof of onward travel. 

If you require a visa to enter Brunei, you might be able to apply for one at a British embassy, high commission or consulate in the country where you legally reside if there is no Bruneian foreign mission. For example, the British embassies in Addis Ababa[http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/countries/ethiopia/commonwealth-bots/?langname=null] and Belgrade[http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/countries/serbia/commonwealth-bots/?langname=null] accept Bruneian visa applications (this list is '''not''' exhaustive). British diplomatic posts charge £50 to process a Bruneian visa application and an extra £70 if the authorities in Brunei require the visa application to be referred to them. The authorities in Brunei can also decide to charge an additional fee if they correspond with you directly.

===By plane===
Brunei's sole airport of significance is '''Brunei International Airport''' [http://www.brunet.bn/gov/dca/fids/] ('''BWN'''), the hub of national carrier '''Royal Brunei Airlines''' [https://www.flyroyalbrunei.com/en/brunei/]. The airport itself is small but clean and functional.

After over-expansion and huge losses in the 1990s, Royal Brunei Airlines (RBA) has cut down on its services considerably but still offers a reasonably comprehensive network, with daily flights to [[London]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Singapore]], and [[Kota Kinabalu]].  There are also frequent flights to [[Jakarta]], [[Surabaya]], [[Bangkok]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Manila]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Shanghai]]. The best prices are usually found on RBAs website. Stopovers in Brunei are available and are good value, though you'll need to book by phone or through a travel agent. RBA is a dry airline; if you wish to drink you must bring your own.

In addition, Singapore Airlines [http://www.singaporeair.com/] flies 5 times a week from Singapore, and Malaysia Airlines [http://www.malaysiaairlines.com.my/] flies from Kuala Lumpur, Kuching and Kota Kinabalu. In July 2006, discount, no-frills carrier AirAsia [http://www.airasia.com/] started flights from Kuala Lumpur, bringing some much-needed competition. AirAsia is the cheapest carrier to serve Brunei from an international Hub, with fares as low as US$35 one-way from Kuala Lumpur. AirAsia flies from 35 destinations in Asia to Kuala Lumpur, where connections to Brunei are available.  Cebu Pacfiic fly red-eye flights to Manila.

Departing by plane from Brunei involves paying a departure tax: B$5 for flights to Kuching and Kota Kinabalu and B$12 to other international destinations. This is now included in the price of most airline tickets.

'''Getting there/away:''' A taxi to [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] takes 20 minutes and costs around B$25. A covered walk down to the end of the car park further away from the Terminal (turn right from Arrivals) leads to a bus stop for Purple buses to the city centre (B$1) along with other busses for tours & hotel shuttles. The reason for the long walk is extensive construction of airport upgrades.

===By car===
You can drive into Brunei from [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]. There are two entry points for the main part of Brunei, one from [[Miri]] at '''Sungai Tujuh''' and one from [[Limbang]] at '''Kuala Lurah''' (Tedungan on the Malaysian side). Both these crossings have drive-through immigration checkpoints at the border but queues can be horribly long, especially during weekends.

'''Note that the border checkpoint opens at 06:00 and closes at 00:00(midnight) daily.'''

It is also possible to drive from the Sarawak towns of [[Limbang]] and [[Lawas]] to the [[Temburong]] district of Brunei. The drive from Limbang requires a ferry ride across the Pandaruan River (RM8 or B$4) which forms the border between Malaysia and Brunei. You can now conduct immigration formalities at Pandaruan (no longer at Limbang Wharf) with the opening of the Malaysian checkpoint in June 2007. Brunei immigration formalities are conducted at '''Puni''', about 600m away from the ferry landing. From [[Lawas]] (which is connected by road to [[Kota Kinabalu]] in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]), a ferry ride across the Trusan River (RM10) is required before you can proceed to the actual border at '''Labu'''. Malaysian immigration formalities are done in Trusan (the immigration office, officially known as the Mengkalap immigration checkpoint, is in a shoplot just east of the ferry crossing) about 8km away, and no longer in Lawas. Those for Brunei can be done at the Labu checkpoint at the border.

It is possible to drive from [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]] to [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] in one day. See the [[Kota Kinabalu to Brunei in a day]] page for details.

===By bus===
*'''To/from Miri:''' The Miri Belait Transportation Company DOES NOT RUN ANYMORE (November 2016). It used to run buses between Kuala Belait in Brunei and [[Miri]] in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]]. The journey required a bus change at the Sungei Tujoh border checkpoint. Through tickets were however available at RM12.20 from [[Miri]]. Note that there have been reports that buses from Miri occasionally refuse to go all the way to the border and stop just before the Asean Bridge at Kuala Baram because of the high toll charge of the bridge. You may had to use taxis to complete the final 5km between the border and the bridge. As of November 2016, this bus does NOT exist anymore (their website is not updated and provides outdated information).

From Kuala Belait, there are buses to Seria (B$1) approx. every 20 minutes, where you can change to another bus for Bandar Seri Begawan (B$6). The entire journey takes about 5 hours. Buses depart Seria every hour.

There are also two express buses a day between Bandar Seri Begawan and Miri, run by PHLS (+673 277 1668).  One runs early in the morning (dep 8:15am from Miri, 7am from Bandar, as of november 2016), and the second in the afternoon (dep 3:45pm from Miri, 1pm from Bandar, as of november 2016). Fares have increased, B$38. If you buy the ticket from the counter at Pujut Bus Terminal it costs 50MYR (September 2018).

*'''To/from Limbang:''' The direct bus from Bandar Seri Begawan to Kota Kinibalu serves Bangar, Limbang, Lawas and other stops en route to Kota Kinibalu. It leaves opposite Tamu Kianggeh at approximately 8am. Alternatively, you can catch a local bus from Bandar's bus station to Kuala Lurah on the border, walk across the checkpoint into Tedungan in Sarawak and catch a Syarikat Bas Limbang bus to Limbang. Do the reverse if coming from Limbang to Bandar. Buses depart from Limbang bus terminal several times a day and bear the destination "Batu Danau". Taxis are also available on both sides of the border but bargain hard for the fare. You can also get to [[Temburong]] district by bus from Limbang, although again, there are no direct buses into [[Bangar]]; all buses (destination "Pandaruan") stop at the ferry landing at Pandaruan, where there is now a Malaysian immigration checkpoint. Cross the river by ferry and catch a taxi for the 5km to Bangar.

*'''To/from Kota Kinabalu:''' There is a daily bus from Bandar Seri Begawan to Kota Kinabalu.  The bus departs opposite Tamu Kianggeh approx 8am and takes approximately 8-9 hours, given twisting single lane highways, picking up and dropping passengers along the way, and the numerous border crossings which entail passport/immigration checks. It costs 100 RM.

===By boat===
The main ferry terminal in Brunei is the '''Serasa Ferry Terminal''' at Muara, where there are several ferries daily to/from [[Labuan]] and one daily ferry each to/from [[Lawas]] and [[Sundar]], both in [[Sarawak]]. With a change of boats in [[Labuan]], you can even make it to/from [[Kota Kinabalu]], [[Sabah]], in a day. See the [[Kota Kinabalu to Brunei in a day]] page. 

Please note that the ferry terminal is quite a distance from actual Muara town where the container port is located. The terminal is about 25km from [[Bandar Seri Begawan]]. '''Getting there:''' There are purple buses (No. 38) linking the ferry terminal with BSB. Or you can just take a tour van / taxi.

There is a car ferry service from Brunei to [[Sabah]] [http://www.pkljaya.com/Timetables.htm]

Please note that you need to pay a tax ("cukai kepala") to get out of Brunei (currently, B$ 2 per ferry ticket). Enquire the counters/travel agent if you didn't get the tax coupon when purchasing the tickets.

==Get around==

===By car===

Foreign visitors who hold a valid drivers licence and an International Driving Permit are permitted to drive in Brunei for up to three months. While driving, drivers must have their identification cards (drivers licence, IDP and passport), vehicle registration documents, and insurance policy in the car.

There is one "motorway", from Bandar Seri Begawan along the coast. It devolves into dual and then single carriageway but is suitable for all vehicles, right through to Kuala Belait and the toll bridge to [[Malaysia]]/[[Sarawak]] in the west. There is also a side road off this, which runs into the jungle towards the settlement of Labi and beyond. Excellent scenery, and a 4-wheel drive may be useful, but the road is now sealed up to the longhouses some distance beyond Labi. Stock up on water at the convenience shop at the junction.

Drivers of vehicles not registered in Brunei can only purchase fuel at 10 designated filling stations throughout the country, to a maximum of 250 litres. Filling a foreign car is more expensive as the purchase price does not include the government subsidy for fuel.

Driving standards can be rather lax compared to other developed nations. Traffic will not always stop at red lights or pedestrian crossings. Speeding and non use of seatbelts is also common.

Most road signs in Brunei are in Malay, written using the Roman script. They also use international symbols similar to that of Singapore and the United Kingdom. However, English is also used for important directional signs such as CIQ checkpoints, airports and tourist attractions.

===By taxi===

There are only ± 40 taxis in the whole of Brunei (2009) owing to the high rate of car ownership and usage. Since there are around 10 waiting at the airport and 8 in the Belait District, there is a little chance of finding a free taxi along the road, especially during morning and afternoon peak hours when they are hired by business people. Needing a taxi might require a phone call. The main taxi stand is direct north of the bus station in the capital with only a few taxis waiting. Taxis may also be available outside some major hotels.

Taxis are not metered since there is no single taxi company, nor any regulations requiring taxis to have a meter. Drivers have fixed prices for most trips, although the tariffs may vary between different drivers, or they will give a price for an irregular trip. There seems to be an app called Dart which is similar to Grab or Uber.

===By tour vans===

Another alternative is hiring a tour van to drive you around Brunei, for example, for a whole day, or several hours. Try asking them from the ferry counters in Muara. Discuss the price first before agreeing to board the van.

===By boat===

; '''Waterways''' : 209 km; navigable by craft drawing less than 1.2 m

===By bus===

[[Image:Brunei_public_bus_map.jpeg|thumb|Brunei bus map]]

Around Bandar Seri Begawan, there is a good-sized network of reliable and punctual purple minibuses. Brunei's high rate of private car ownership means very few Bruneians take these buses, which largely cater to foreign workers. The speed of the buses are limited to 50km/h, but they remain quite efficient. Note that bus routes cease operation before 2000.

In general, the bus system around the capital radiates from the bus terminal in the central district. There are designated bus stops along each route, but passengers are picked up or let off at unofficial locations at the discretion of the driver. The unofficial mode of operation makes easy travel and entices patronage. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain some form of details on bus routes and timetables. Recent experience in mid 2011 prompted a small contribution in the form of pictures of the known bus routes at the time.(The pictures of the bus routes will be posted at a later date). There are 13 routes and the fare is flat B$1.00, which is collected by a conductor. The passenger can advise the driver the location to disembark. Sometimes, the conductor asks the passengers their respective locations to disembark and skips part of the route, to the dismay of passenger who wishes to catch the bus. This also implies that there is no strict scheduled time. It is quite normal to wait 30 to 45 minutes for a bus.

There is also an infrequent long-distance bus which runs between BSB and Seria through Tutong.

==Talk==
The official language of Brunei is '''[[Malay phrasebook|Malay]]'''; the official standard being the same as that of [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. While all Bruneians are able to converse in standard Malay, the local dialect of Malay is almost incomprehensible to other Malay speakers. Solely among the Malay-speaking states, Brunei also officially uses the Arabic script for Malay known as ''Jawi'', although most signs are written both in Jawi and Roman letters. Nevertheless, the Roman alphabet is still the more commonly used script when writing Malay in Brunei.

Due to the British colonial past, most people in Brunei are fluent '''English''' speakers. English is the medium of instruction for all subjects in the local schools from the fourth year of primary school onwards, with maths and science being taught in English from the start of primary school. English is also the main language of the local courts. A little Malay will come in handy in rural areas, as English proficiency is limited there. 

The ethnic Chinese community in Brunei continues to speak a variety of Chinese languages, including Hokkien, Teochew and several others.

All adherents of the Islamic faith, especially the more devout, possess some proficiency in reading and speaking [[Arabic phrasebook|Arabic]], which is also taught in the local schools.

The Indian minority in Brunei are mostly [[Tamil phrasebook|Tamil]] speakers. There is also a a contingent of Gurkha soldiers stationed in Brunei who speak [[Nepali phrasebook|Nepali]].

==Do==
For things to do in and in the near vicinity of Bandar Seri Begawan, see [[Bandar Seri Begawan]].

There are many eco-tours which typically go to the '''Temburong''' district by boat then to a native "longhouse". It is then followed by a powered boat (by the natives) up the river to the '''Belalong National Park''', a reserve in the Borneo rainforest.  There is a canopy walk and research centre at the park headquarters. Visitors can book to stay overnight at the [http://www.uluuluresort.com Ulu Ulu Resort], experience different outdoor adventure with [http://www.freme.com/bruneitours/temburong-tours/ Freme Rainforest Lodge] at it's Adventure Park and discover the rainforest with [http://www.borneoguide.com BorneoGuide] and stay in the [http://www.sumbiling.com Sumbiling Eco Village].

For nature lovers, a new activity to try in Brunei is the '''Tutong River''' cruise tour, about 40 minutes away from [Bandar Seri Begawan]. The cruise provided by [http://www.bruneiborneo.com Sunshine Borneo Tours & Travel] emphasizes on mangrove ecology and conservation education. The beautiful and calm mangrove-fringed Tutong River is home to the endemic Proboscis monkeys, eagles, crocodiles, macaques, kingfishers and other wildlife. Some villages and other eco-activities can also be found on [http://www.ekobrunei.com Eko-Brunei]

'''Bukit Shahbandar''' is a nature reserve offering several hikes according to the number of small peaks you want to ascend. All well marked. The longest takes 1.5 to 2 hours among trees and steep dirt hills. At the bottom, there is a park and jogging trail. It is a 5 min drive or a 15 min walk from The Empire Hotel. Most people go there to exercise while others go there to take pictures, play at the mini playground or to buy the famous fresh coconut juice.

'''Jerudong Park''' was once a decent theme park with a multitude of rides. Sadly, a downward cycle of neglect, declining admission and unaffordable maintenance costs led to the closure and sale of most of the big-ticket rides, including the three rollercoasters. This has given the park a sad "circus left town last week" air about it. Though in recent years there have been attempts to revive the park, including some new rides (mainly for children) as well as clown shows. The original bumper cars, go-karts, paddle-boats & merry-go-round are still operational. As is the fountain & light show.

You can also visit the water village called ''''Kampong Ayer'''', where you will ride on boat to reach the old, traditional village. All day and night in the water village, you will hear the sounds of engines roaring and water splashing. The rough texture of the handmade boats and the houses above the calm, brown silty water, is what makes Kampong Ayer a unique cultural and traditional place. When you ride on the boat to the village, you will see other boats that are zooming very fast and all you can hear is the rough waves hitting the boats and the whooshing sound of wind passing by your face.   

'''Tamu Kianggeh''' is also located in Bandar Seri Begawan, near Kampong Ayer. At the entrance of Tamu Kianggeh, traditional music is played by people using traditional instruments such as Gulingtangan and Gambus. Tamu Kianggeh is a market that sells fresh fruit and vegetables, sweet and fresh drinks and also delicious and fresh cooked dry food such as Kuih Malaya. the sweet smell of banana fritters (cucur pisang) being fried is heavenly. The loud sound of people yelling and shouting about what they are selling is heard from metres away.

Most people who visit only go at night to avoid the heat during the day. Outside the park, but very close, is a small complex of restaurants which is open at night, though only around half of the stalls are still operational.


===Scuba diving===

Brunei offers some great diving. In addition to coral and fish, Brunei is home to several '''shipwrecks''' and many species of '''nudibranch''' - one of the best places in S.E. Asia for macro photography. Water temperature is generally around 86 degrees (30 Celsius) and visibility is usually in the 10-30m range, although this can be changeable during the monsoon season. As diving here is not overly developed, it means that the sites, and especially the coral reefs, are unspoiled and in pristine condition.

Popular dive sites include the '''American Wreck''', Admirable Class Minesweeper, USS Salute (AM-294) lies broken in half on a sand bottom at 30m after hitting a Japanese mine on the 8th June 1945, during  pre-invasion sweeps of the Brunei Bay, with the loss of nine lives. '''Australian Wreck''', In 1949 while on a voyage to Manila it struck a mine off Brunei and sank. The wreck lies in 33m of water and is roughly 85m. '''Dolphin 88 Wreck''' Malaysian commercial vessel sunk in bad weather in 2013. Experienced divers will enjoy exploring the interior of the wreck. '''Oil Rig Wreck''', a decommissioned oil rig. There are 9 structures to be explored, each seeming to be home to one dominant group of fish. '''Baiei Maru Wreck''' was a Japanese oil tanker that sank in October 1944 in Brunei Bay after hitting a Japanese mine. Discovered by the Brunei Shell Petroleum during a survey, the wreck sits in about 50m of water and has only recently been dove in what is believed to be the first time in June 2008 by local club divers. Other dive sites includes '''Labuan Wreck''', '''Bolkiah Wreck''', '''UBD Wreck''', '''Amai Wreck''', '''Arun Wreck''', '''Stone Wreck''' to name a few.

Diving is very reasonable, averaging out to BN$35-45 per dive depending on how many dives you do and whether you bring your own gear. There are a number of organisations you can do trips with such as; [http://www.ponidivers.com/ Poni Divers],[http://www.oceanicquest.com/ Oceanic Quest], [http://www.bsadc.com/Index.html The Brunei Sub Aqua Dive Club] in Brunei-Muara & [http://www.panagaclub.com/divisions/kbbc/diving/panagadivers/index.htm Panaga Divers] based in seria

===Sunset===

Brunei has one of the most beautiful sunsets in Asia. Tourists tend to watch sunset at The Empire Hotel or nearest beaches.

==Buy==
The local currency is the '''Brunei dollar''' ('''BND, B$'''); you might hear ''ringgit'' used to refer to the dollar but be sure that participants are not talking about the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) which is valued at less than half a Brunei dollar.

As of 26th April 2017  BND1.00 = USD0.72 = GBP0.56  = €0.66 = MYR3.12 = RMB4.94 = JPY79.79

The Brunei dollar is tied to the [[Singapore]] dollar at a 1:1 rate. By law both currencies can be used interchangeably, so if you're coming in from Singapore, there's no reason to change money as your cash will be readily accepted. (Likewise, any leftover Brunei dollars can be used at par in Singapore. Although Singaporean coins can be used in Brunei with the exception of the SGD1, Singapore does not accept Bruneian coins. However, many stores refuse Singapore notes with seemingly microscopic tears in them, and notices to this effect are posted at the cash register. 

The Brunei dollar is divided into 100 cents. There are banknotes  [http://www.finance.gov.bn/tt/EDITKKW/bcb/notes_cir_2nd.htm] from BND1 to a whopping BND10,000 (handy if you're shopping for Rolls-Royces) and coins [http://www.finance.gov.bn/tt/EDITKKW/bcb/notes_cir_2nd.htm] of 1 to 50 cents. All smaller notes and the 2004 series of larger notes are printed as brightly coloured polymer notes.

===Costs===
By South-East Asian standards Brunei is roughly on par with Singapore, meaning roughly twice as expensive as neighbouring [[Malaysia]]. You can reduce costs by eating at local restaurants and avoiding the more expensive restaurants in hotels. Budget accommodation, once very limited, has expanded in recent years and you can now get a decent bed for the night for around B$30.

==Eat==
{{infobox|Knock knock, who's there? Nasi Katok|Katok is actually "ketuk" in the Malay language, and it means knock. There is a story behind the name Nasi Katok. It was begun by a couple of teenagers who were feeling very hungry after a midnight practice. They went to a place where they normally bought their food. This place was actually a residential house, which offered Nasi bungkus (a pack of rice with chicken and egg) even in the middle of the night. At any time you could just Katok (knock) on their door, and the owner will come up with fresh hot Nasi Katok. And that's how it became Nasi Katok.}}

Bruneians love to eat out and there are many excellent restaurants in Brunei serving a wide variety of cuisines, thanks to the large number of foreign workers in the country.

There is also the local ''nasi katok'', a simple combination of rice and curried beef or chicken, which can be quite spicy. It is relatively inexpensive when compared to other food that you can buy, for example local food such as chicken rice. 

Another choice is ''ambuyat'', a culinary experience unique to Borneo. It is a starchy and gooey paste made from sago that can be dipped into a savoury sauce.

Brunei produces excellent quality soy sauce, darker, thicker and stronger in flavour than you'd typically find in Japan or China.

==Drink==

===Alcohol===

Brunei is a "dry country;" '''alcohol is not sold anywhere in the country and consumption of alcohol in public is prohibited by law.'''  That said, non-Muslim visitors are allowed to bring in up to two litres of alcohol (wine or spirits), plus up to twelve 330mL cans of beer, lager or cider every 48 hours. According to the laws of Brunei, this alcohol must be “stored and consumed at the place of residence of the importer” and is “not to be given, transferred or sold to another person.”

As alcohol is not sold in Brunei, there is a wide array of duty-free shops just across the border in Malaysia to cater to the high demand for personal importation. However, alcohol permits must be obtained upon arrival in Brunei while going through customs. (At customs you will be required to fill in a yellow form to declare your alcohol.)

The legal age for privately possessing and consuming alcohol in Brunei is 17, however you have to be 21 to purchase alcohol in Malaysia.

===Other beverages===

One should definitely try out ''Teh Tarik'', a sweet milk tea that is poured from one cup to another to create a layer of bubbles that bring out the aromatic smell of tea, ''Teh C Special'', another form of milk tea that is mixed with the palm sugar that gives a distinct taste to it, as well as the wide array of coffee (''kopi'') available in restaurants.

==Sleep==
Accommodation in Brunei was until recently famously expensive &mdash; there is still only one youth hostel in the entire country &mdash; but some reasonably cheap guesthouses can now be found here and there.  See [[Bandar Seri Begawan]] for listings.

There are also some decent accommodation and even business hotels in other parts of Brunei.

==Learn==

==Work==
Many of the jobs in Brunei are in the gas and oil industry but many positions have opened up for international English Teachers due to the booming economy and business sector. [http://www.footprintsrecruiting.com/ Footprints Recruiting] offers placement in  teaching jobs in Brunei. This can be a great way to absorb the culture and see many of the wonderful attractions Brunei has to offer, while making money to boot.

==Stay safe==
{{warningbox|Brunei treats '''drug offences''' ''extremely'' severely. The death penalty is '''mandatory''' for those convicted of trafficking, manufacturing, importing or exporting more than 1 g of heroin, 1 g of morphine, 1 g of cocaine, 1 g of cannabis, 1 g of cannabis resin and 1 g of opium, and possession of these quantities is all that is needed for you to be convicted. For unauthorised consumption, there is a maximum of 10 years' jail or a heavy fine, or both. You can be charged for unauthorised consumption as long as traces of illicit drugs are found in your system, even if you can prove that they were consumed outside the country, and you can be charged for trafficking as long as drugs are found in bags that are in your possession or in your room, even if they aren't yours and regardless of whether you're aware of them - therefore be vigilant of your possessions.}}

Brunei is a very safe country, with theft being uncommon and violent crime almost unheard of. However basic travelling safety precautions should be taken at all times. Brunei has mixed legal system based on English common law and Sharia (Islamic) law.

Brunei revised its penal code in 2014, imposing Sharia law in three phases. Currently it is still on the first phase (April 2017). The first phase of Sharia law includes only fines and prison sentences for crimes. The Penal Code applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims. However, many of the specific offences are applicable to Muslims only. For example, non-Muslims can be implicated for adultery if committed with a Muslim, consuming alcohol in a public place, close proximity to the other gender if committed with a Muslim, contempt of the Prophet Muhammad, deriding verses of the Quran or Hadith, indecent behaviour and disrespecting Ramadan (fasting month).

It is illegal for any person to consume food, drink or tobacco in public during the fasting hours of Ramadan - this can attract fines of up to B$4,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 1 year.

'''Possession of pornographic material, in addition to homosexual and prostitution activities, are illegal.''' These laws apply to foreigners as well. There are severe penalties in Brunei including, in some cases, the death penalty. Some crimes may attract caning and lengthy prison sentences.

It is difficult to obtain tobacco in Brunei; travellers may bring in their own tobacco, but there is no duty-free allowance. '''Duty charge on cigarettes is BND0.50/stick,''' i.e. BND10 per pack of 20 sticks and BND100 per carton of 10 packs. Duty charge on other tobacco products may vary.

The carriage of live ammunition, including amulets, lucky charms, decorations, and other byproducts containing prohibited items, is a serious offence punishable by law for 5 to 15 years of imprisonment and 3 to 12 strokes of caning. This applies to all passengers travelling to or transiting through Brunei without exception.

===LGBT travellers===
Travel Alert:  Country practices Sharia and is not a safe country for gays or lesbians. Homosexuality is punishable by death by stoning.

==Stay healthy==
Eating out is generally safe because of good food safety standards, although tap water is not fit for drinking & should be boiled first. Alternatively, bottled water is very cheap.

==Respect==
The Brunei Government is run as a Malay Islamic Monarchy; as such, the Sultan of Brunei - apart from being one of the richest men in the world - is in charge and frequently appears on the front page of the two daily newspapers. '''At all costs, do not insult or speak badly of the Royal Family''' - His Majesty The Sultan and other members of the Royal Family are highly revered and public criticism of them will cause great offence.

Furthermore, though Bruneians are generally courteous and tolerant, it is a good idea to be aware of sensitivities surrounding certain topics of conversation, especially politics (domestic, regional & international) and world events, particularly those relating to Islam or Islamic countries.

Bruneian values are strongly influenced by Islam. Places of business and offices, including shops and restaurants, shut between 1200 and 1400 every Friday for Friday prayers.

Some courtesies to observe include the following:

* Remove shoes before entering mosques
* For women, ensure that the head, knees, and arms are covered before entering mosques
* Do not pass in front of people in prayers
* Do not touch the Qur'an
* Shake hands lightly if you must, but never with a member of the opposite sex
* Point with the right thumb instead of the index finger
* Beckon another with the palm facing downwards
* Do not smack the right fist into the left palm
* Food and gifts must be passed with the right hand
* When sitting, the sole of the feet should not be pointed towards one's companions

==Contact==

===By phone===
The international code for Brunei is '''673'''. The telephone numbers in Brunei consist of 7 digits with no local codes, although the first digit of the number indicates the area such as 3 for the Belait District and 2 for Bandar Seri Begawan.
<br> The prepaid '''Hallo Kad''', available from '''TelBru''' telephone offices (including one at the airport) and other outlets in denominations from B$5 to B$50 can be used at any phone in the country to make local and international calls.  Other phone cards are also available for use in public phones. <br> GSM mobile phone services are available from network operator ''' DST''' [http://www.dst-group.com/]. They have a good range of roaming connections.  3G mobile phone services are available from '''B-Mobile''' [http://www.bmobile.com.bn/].

B-Mobile is now known as Progresif Cellular Sdn Bhd (PCSB). Once exit from the Arrival Hall at Brunei International Airport, they have a counter selling simcards & plans. There is also a Visitor Sim - for short term stay (BND10 all in SMS, voice & data).

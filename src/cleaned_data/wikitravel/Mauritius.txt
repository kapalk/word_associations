[http://tourism-mauritius.mu '''Mauritius'''] (French: ''L’île Maurice'', Mauritian Creole: ''Moris'') is a small, multi-cultural island in the [[Islands of the Indian Ocean|Indian Ocean]], east of [[Madagascar]], NorthEast of [[Reunion]] and southeast of the [[Seychelles]]. Mauritius also controls [[Rodrigues]] Island and the remote, sparsely populated Agalega and Cargados Garayos (Saint Brandon) islands.

==Understand==

===History===
The island of Mauritius was first discovered by Arab sailors, at some time in the 9th century, the exact date is unknown. At that time the island was uninhabited and covered in a dense forest. The Arab sailors were not interested in settling on the island which they named ''Dina Arobi'' or ''Dinarobin''. Diogo Fernandes Pereira, a Portuguese sailor found the island in 1505 and decided to give it the name of ''Cerne''. However, the Portuguese did not settle permanently on the island either.

The first to colonise the island were the Dutch. They took possession of the island in 1598. The Dutch settlers landed on a bay in the south-eastern part of the island which was named ''Warwyck Haven'' after the commander VanWarwyck, the bay is now known as Grand Port. Mauritius also got its name during this period; the island was named after the Prince of Holland Mauritz de Nassau. His father William of Orange, (also know as William the Silent), was the head of the Duch East India Company and forefather of the legendary Scottish Clan comprising the Dukes of Atholl, and the Murray and Smythe families, through Mauritz' sister Charlotte of Brabantina.

In 1710, the Dutch abandoned the island, leaving behind macaques, the java deer, sugar cane, fugitive slaves and, also, an irreversible damage to the endemic and indigenous flora and fauna of the island - the Dodo  was, by then, extinct due to extensive hunting, the bird being very easy to capture, while the once abundant black ebony tree population was almost completely depleted due to over-exploitation for its timber.

The French settled on the island in 1713, also landing at the bay in the south-east. They renamed the bay Port Bourbon and renamed the island ''Ile de France''. They settled on the north-western side of the island and established their main harbour there, Port Louis, the present-day capital of Mauritius. During the French settlement there was a lot of development in the country. Mahé de Labourdonnais , whose statue can be seen across from the harbour in Port Louis, is known as the founder of the capital city and the island prospered under his governance (1735-1746).

In August 1810, the British tried to take over the island but lost after a fierce battle against the French in the famous '''Battle of Grand Port'''. However, the British came back in December 1810 and successfully defeated the French. From then on, the island was renamed Mauritius and remained under British rule until it attained independence. 

In 1835, slavery was officially abolished and, as most of the African slaves chose to abandon the agricultural fields and move to small coastal villages, indentured labourers (coolies) were brought in from India (Tamilnadu & Bihar) to work in the growing sugar-cane industry. 

On 12 Mar 1968 Mauritius became an independent nation within the Commonwealth led by Prime Minister Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, also known as the "Father of the Nation", led the island to independence and did a lot to develop the  country. 

A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, Mauritius has attracted considerable foreign investment and has one of Africa's highest per capita incomes. Recent poor weather and declining sugar prices have slowed economic growth leading to some protests over standards of living in the Creole community.

===Climate===
Tropical, modified by southeast trade winds; warm, dry winter (May to November); hot, wet, humid summer (November to May); ''Natural hazards'' : tropical cyclones (November to April), most cyclones usually occur from the end of December until March. Mauritius has only two seasons, winter and summer. There is not much temperature difference between the two seasons of the year. The climate on the central plateau is cooler than on the coastal areas.

The arrivals hall can get rather congested in the morning when most of the flights from Europe arrive. Immigration officers tend to be rather slow and the whole immigration process can be a frustrating experience.

Visitors are required to provide accommodation details to the immigration service on arrival. 
If you arrive in Mauritius  from a country where malaria is endemic, you may receive a visit from the government health service and be required to give a blood sample for malaria screening.

=== By sea ===
Vessels that arrive at the port are mainly cargo ships. The Mauritius Pride and the Trochetia are the Mauritian vessels that usually sail to and from [[Reunion]] Island, Rodrigues Island and [[Madagascar]]. Costa Cruises ships have recently started an Indian Ocean cruise including a visit to Mauritius.

As of April 2008, one way passage prices to travel from Tamatave in Madagascar to Mauritius by boat were €275 first class or €255 second class, compared to €212 to fly from Antananarivo on Air Madagascar.  The journey takes at least four days, possibly more if transiting through Reunion.  A boat leaves every other Wednesday.

The prices quoted are for a passage in a first or second class cabin.  In attempting to go directly to the port in Tamatave to negotiate with a boat captain for a non-cabin berth, tourists are turned away at the gate.  Visiting the Nautical Club in Tamatave to enquire about yachts that might be heading to Mauritius also yields no results.

==Get around==
Bus and taxi services are best used in urban areas. Bicycles and motorbikes are also available for hire.

Several fairly good bus services serve the island. Taking the bus is the most economical way of travelling. Air-conditioned buses have been recently introduced on some routes.

The major bus companies are:
* <listing name="National Transport Corporation" alt="NTC" phone="+230 426 2938"></listing>

Buses are still manned by a driver and a conductor who walks around collecting fares and issuing tickets after passengers have boarded. Tell the conductor where you want to go and he'll tell you the fare amount. Upon payment, he'll give you a ticket with the charged amount printed on it. 

Most conductors are very helpful in providing directions to tourists. In the local Creole dialect, the conductors are called ''con-tro-lair'' (literally controller).

Bus routes and schedules are available from the ''Ministry of Transport'' [http://www.gov.mu/portal/site/mpisite/menuitem.40c0fec70451b85a8f77861048a521ca/?content_id=42d650443f758010VgnVCM100000ca6a12acRCRD] and Mauritius Buses [http://www.mauritius-buses.com/] who list all the main operators and their schedules.

==Talk==

Mauritius does not have an official language, but the main language of government is '''English'''. As such, all government administrative documents are in the [[EngVar|Commonwealth variety of English]], which is also used as the prime medium of instruction in public schools.

However, '''[[French phrasebook|French]]''' is the language most commonly used in formal settings, and is by far the dominant language in the mass media, as well as in corporate and business dealings. In fact, even English language television programs are usually dubbed into French.

The most commonly spoken language is '''Mauritian Creole''', a French based creole which has incorporated some words from diverse sources including but not limited to English, Dutch and Portuguese, and has slight pronunciation differences from standard French. While there is no official written standard for Mauritian Creole, when written down for informal communication, words are often spelled differently from standard French. 

The next most commonly spoken language is French, which is spoken fluently by most locals, with English being a not too distant third. Virtually everyone working in the tourism industry will be able to speak fairly decent, albeit heavily accented, English, and all government departments will have English-speaking staff on duty. 

Tamils constitute around 10% of the population and speak [[Tamil phrasebook|Tamil]]. Other languages spoken by much smaller numbers include: [[Hindi phrasebook|Hindi]], [[Urdu phrasebook|Urdu]], Hakka, Telugu, Marathi, Bhojpuri and [[Chinese phrasebook|Mandarin]].

[[Image:Grand_Baie%2C_view_from_the_offshore.JPG|thumb|right|[[Grand Bay]] from offshore]]

*'''[[Grand Bay]]''' was the first area of the island to fully experience the tourist boom. A shopping and leisure paradise, Grand Bay is also where Mauritians go when they want a fun-filled night out (restaurants, bars and discos). Recently renovated, La Cuvette beach is well worth a visit. 

*'''Pereybere''' &mdash; The wonderful Pereybere public beach, voted World's Most Beautiful Beach in 2010 is popular because of its shopping facilities, restaurants and pubs. This is one of the best beaches for swimming. Glass bottomed boat trips, Mangrove forest visits,water skiing and tubing. Eating varies from street food sellers to fabulous restaurants.  It is also the launch point for some of the best diving diver training and dive instructor training on the Island and offers accommodation varying from economical self catering apartments to 5 star hotels and beach resorts. It is the focus of Mauritian Life holidays.

*'''Balaclava Ruins''' &mdash; Near (a few metres) Baie aux Tortues, which 17th century sailors named after the many tortoises in the area, can be found the ruins of the old Balaclava estate. Visitors can see the sea walls, whose initial foundations were laid down by Mahé de Labourdonnais. The location of the ruins now form part of Maritim Hotel, and public access may not be possible.

*'''The Triolet Shivala''' &mdash; The longest village on the island, Triolet offers an opportunity to visit the biggest Hindu temple, the Maheswarnath, first built in 1819 in honour of the Gods Shiva, Krishna, Vishnu, Muruga, Brahma and Ganesha.

In addition to the harbor of Mauritius, you will also find the movie theater, game arcades, and local restaurants. 

*'''The Bazaar of Port-Louis''' &mdash; Literally translated as "The Market of Port Louis" &mdash; here you will find a variety of local snacks and tropical fruits, the cheapest food you will find in the capital city. Numerous shops sell well made traditional crafted objects such as the "goni" basket. Unfortunately you will also find a lot of stalls selling pirate versions of programs, movies and games: they are extremely cheap but still are illegal and do not guarantee quality. You may get a version that is not the original, but created by other than what is stated. Like all crowded areas, be wary of your surroundings and keep your belongings close to you. Food sold on the street may have health issues, but that is, for the most part, rare. If you have any allergies, refrain from eating at these stalls.

*'''The SSR Botanical Garden''' If you want to see some plants originating from Mauritius, then this is the place for you. The SSR botanical garden is the oldest botanical garden in the Southern Hemisphere. It was founded by Pierre Poivre (1719 – 1786) in 1770, contains some flora unique to Mauritius and covers an area of around 37 hectares. It also has several animals, being especially famous for its fish, deer and tortoises, as well as an old replica of a sugar mill.

*'''Aquarium''' Situated near Pointe Aux Piments, this aquarium contains a wide variety of fishes and crabs. You can also see some sharks and turtles in a big tank placed in the aquarium. Stone fish and muray fish can also be seen in the aquarium.

*'''Restaurants''' &mdash; Don't hesitate to go to the various local restaurants around the city. Although many of them advertise a specific ethnic cuisine, like everywhere around the world they have their own mix of traditional and local. Fried rice, for example, may be different than your usual experience.

===East===
*'''Flacq Market''' &mdash; Flacq is one of the most important villages in Mauritius. This meeting point for inhabitants of the East boasts the country’s largest open air market. This extremely colourful market attracts a large number of people. 

*'''The Waterpark Leisure Village''' &mdash; Enjoy sliding on the giant chutes with family or friends. Relaxation and pleasure guaranteed. 

*'''Ile aux Cerfs''' &mdash; A paradise for water sports and has one of the most beautiful beaches in Mauritius. You cannot afford to miss this tiny island, delicately poised on the ocean, a real pearl in the Mauritian landscape. Price conscious visitors would be well advised to take ample food and drink, as the only bar and restaurant on the island primarily targets well-heeled tourists. Boats depart regularly from Trou-d'Eau Douce village in the East which has some of the best seafood restaurants on the island. A variety of vessels serve the route including catamarans, yachts and "pirate-ships". Some serve food (usually barbecue, especially seafood) on board included in the price and tend to take a detour to the Grand River South East waterfalls for a visit. The island also has a 5-star hotel (Le Touessrok) and a golf course. 

*'''Beaches'''&mdash; The eastern part of the island is known for its long sand bank beaches and famous hotels such as "The Coco Beach Hotel" and the 5-star "Le Touessrok".

===South east===
*'''Dutch Ruins''' &mdash; At Vieux Grand Port, the oldest settlement in Mauritius, you can see the ruins of the first Dutch fortifications. Excavation work is under way in a bid to uncover an important part of Mauritian history.

*'''Ile aux Aigrettes''' &mdash; As a result of the remarkable work accomplished by the Mauritius Wildlife Fund, the island has become an international standard for the protection of natural resources and endangered species. A few of the world’s rarest birds, including the kestrel, can be seen there. You can also see the extremely rare Pink Pigeon, the Green Gecko Phelsuma and the Aldabra giant tortoise. 

*'''Mahebourg''' is one of the main fishing villages on the island. Built on the magnificent Grand Port Bay, it was founded in 1804 by the French Governor Charles Decaën.  The Monday markets are among the biggest and best on the island and are held right next to the main bus station.  

*'''Domaine du Chasseur''' &mdash; ☎ +230 634-5011, (''Fax: +230 634-5261''). Nestling in the Anse Jonchée hills, the Domaine des Grand Bois has splendid hunting grounds covering an area of 900 hectares. Stags, monkeys and boars live amidst the luxuriant vegetation of the hillside. One can watch a few species of endangered birds, including the kestrel. The Domaine contains four thatched-roof bungalows and a restaurant with a panoramic sea view. Take an opportunity to enjoy a meal of venison. (The view is great and well worth the visit, but the food can best be described as average.  The venison is very chewy.) There is a steep hike up the hill from the car park to the restaurant.  The restaurant offers a 4wd taxi service which is free if you eat one of their overpriced meals, but if you only want a cup of tea or desert they will slug you an outrageous 230 Rupee per person, for the 5 minute ride. 

*'''Souillac''' &mdash; A small seaside resort along the rugged coast of the Savanne district. A famous feature is the garden overlooking the sea and named after Dr. Charles Telfair. A popular viewpoint is found at the southern end of the village, right on the cliff top : Gris Gris.

*'''[[Blue Bay]]''' &mdash; Bluest water and most amazing white sand beaches you will ever see... Take the trip across the island from Port Louis and see what this quiet place has to offer.  Very busy with the locals on weekends.  Try to go during the week.  Glass bottom boats are an excellent outing. Part of Blue Bay has been designated a Marine Park, and the snorkeling trips by boat to this area, offered for sale on the main public beach, are well worth trying.

*'''Rochester Falls''' &mdash; Rochester Falls is a waterfall on the Savanne River located approximately 2.5 km from Souillac. It is famous among youngsters who often perform dives into the water below.

===West===
*'''Tamarin Beach''' offers white sands and crystal clear waters and both novice to expert surfers visit for some of the best waves on the island. The bay also has its own dolphin pod and dramatic views across to the Montage du Rempart – an extinct volcano. It was voted '''Beach of the Week''' by luxury online travel magazine '''Beach Tomato''' on 29th November 
*'''Flic en Flac''' &mdash; A local fishing village that has expanded to become a popular destination for tourists and expats. Flic en Flac has a very long white sandy beach stretching down the west coast to Tamarin which is enjoyed by both locals and tourists. Scuba Diving is a major attraction here with excellent diving just a few minutes from the beach. There is a reasonable supermarket and a variety of accommodations and restaurants to suit all budgets. 

*'''Martello Towers''' &mdash; at La Preneuse, Black River, represent the ancient rivalry between old colonial powers and the ingenuity of mankind. They are a milestone in the island’s history; they symbolise the end of slavery and the beginning of Indian immigration.

*'''Chamarel''' &mdash; A winding road leads from Case Noyale village to the coloured earths of Chamarel: an undulating landscape of different and contrasting shades of colours. The different shades of blue, green, red and yellow are apparently the result of the erosion of the volcanic ash. The neighbouring waterfalls of Chamarel rise from the moors and the native plant life. The site possesses a rare beauty. An adventure park has also recently been opened at Chamarel.  Much of the sand has been souvenired by locals.  It is now sectioned off, but is not that impressive.

*'''Salt Pans''' &mdash; Owing to the exceptional high level of sunshine the district receives, Tamarin is the heart of salt production in Mauritius.

*'''Casela''' &mdash; ☎ +230 452-2828. Situated in the Rivière Noire district, the Casela Nature & Leisure Park stretches over 25 hectares.

Activities like walking with lions, Rando Fun (ziplines & hanging bridges), quad, buggy & Segway, a petting farm and many more promise a fun day for the whole family. 

*'''Yemen''' &mdash; Yemen Reserve may not be the largest game reserve on the island, but there is still lots to see. You will be able to get close to the herds of deer, and admire some splendid species of Mauritian fauna. A few rustic kiosks available in the reserve provide an unobstructed view of the sea. There you can sip a local punch while watching the sun going down.

===The interior===
*'''Black River Gorges''' &mdash; This national park of 6,574 hectares (16,244 acres) was created in 1994 for the protection of Mauritius’ remaining native forests. Visitors can enjoy magnificent landscapes, with endemic plants and rare bird species. A trail leads from the Pétrin information centre to an area of typical plant life and to a conservation area.

*'''Eureka''' &mdash; ☎ +230 326-4775, (''Fax:+230 326-9732''). Is an old Creole residence built in 1830, Eureka is an essential place to visit during your stay in Mauritius if you wish to immerse yourself in tropical sweetness. Includes a tour of the colonial house with the opportunity to purchase overpriced textile products, and a tour of the gardens and a visit to the waterfalls below.

[[Image:Grand Bassin Mauritius.JPG|thumb|Grand Bassin]]

*'''Ganga Talao - Grand Bassin''' &mdash; Beyond La Marie and '''Mare-aux-Vacoas''' is found one of the two natural lakes of Mauritius. It rests within the crater of an extinct volcano. Ganga Talao is an important pilgrimage site and many Mauritians of the Hindu faith walk there during the Maha Shivaratri festival or the night fasting dedicated to Shiva.

==Buy==
*'''Shop''' &mdash; Mauritius is not at all like Bali or Thailand.  Don't expect the local merchants to be interested in a long bartering game.  Many shops will not come down on price at all and even at the markets don't expect more than a 10-20% discount.  There are bargains to be had however, many large brand names in the textile world are manufactured in Mauritius and you can often find over runs or slightly flawed items at a fraction of the European prices.

==Eat==
Mauritius is a paradise for the senses, not only for the eyes with its beautiful landscape, but also for the palate. Gastronomes will find a variety of flavours and aromas inherited from the different migrations through its history. Culinary traditions from France, India, China and Africa, the best-known and appreciated cuisines in the world, have been passed on through generations.

Depending on the region, rice or a variety of flat bread called chapattis or roti, called farata (paratha) by the local people, is eaten with curries. The extensive use of spices like saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves and herbs like thyme, basil, and curry leaves are the common ingredients that provide some powerful, yet subtle, savour. Dal, a variety of lentil soup, are many and varied according to which type of lentil is used; vegetables, beans, and pickles accompany the dishes. Dholl puri and roti, originally an Indian delicacy have become the fish and chips of Mauritians.

Biryani from Mughal origins is a dish expertly prepared by the Muslim community, with meat mixed with spiced rice and potatoes.

You can buy many snacks on the streets of Mauritius including the famous gateaux piments (a variant of the indian vadai ; literally, chilli cakes), and vegetable or meat samosas (puffs), along with octopus curry in bread. The tomato and onion based dish called Rougaille (pronounced ''rooh-guy'') is a variation of the French ragoût . The dish usually consists of meat or seafood (corned beef and salted snoek fish rougaille are very popular with the locals) and all Mauritians eat this dish often if not daily.

Mauritians have a sweet tooth and make many types of 'gateaux', as they are called. The cakes vary and you can find cakes very much like those in France and others similar to Indian sweets like Gulab Jamun and Rasgulla among many others. 

Check out the queues where the street sellers are selling their type of snacks and the longest queue will probably have the tastiest food on sale and is very cheap.

*'''Lunch''' &mdash; For an adventurous lunch of roasted wild boar, duck or deer curry with one of the best island views, try Domaine du Chasseur's alfresco Panoramour Restaurant. This domain is the best place to glimpse the Mauritius kestrel in the wild. '''Be aware''' there is a steep hike up the hill from the car park to the restaurant. The restaurant offers a 4wd taxi service which is free if you eat one of their overpriced meals, but if you only want a cup of tea or desert they will slug you an outrageous 230 Rupee per person, for the 5 minute ride.

When leaving Mauritius, don't wait until you go through passport control if you want to have a snack. The coffee shop after passport control is not value for money. You would be better off visiting the snack bar before check-in and taking your purchases through with you.

==Drink==
Mauritius produces a wide range of cane rum. It is very cheap and is a nice drink when mixed with cola and ice. Don't forget the coconut water with a dash of lime and a splash of local rum over ice. The serious amateur will try to find a bottle of five years old (or older) rum. Worth the price difference!

If you are staying in a hotel where the drinks are wildly expensive consider collecting your tipples while you are out and about from the local village shops or supermarkets where the prices are much cheaper.

The local beer Phoenix costs around 30 rupees (less than one pound sterling) for a pint. Usually served very cold.

The local Black Eagle beer, brewed in Nouvelle France is one to watch out for as well. Definite refreshment to match the sweltering summer heat.

Try visiting the '''Medine Estate Refinery''' shop at Bambous (4 km from Flic en Flac), on the west of the Island, for a wide variety of locally produced rums and liquors.

==Sleep==
<!--Please do not list hotels or other specific accommodations here. Place such listings in the relevant local guide.-->

==Stay safe==
Be alert for your own security in Mauritius. 
Exercise common sense and look out for suspicious behaviour, as you would anywhere in the world. 
Be a smart traveller. Before your trip: 
Organize comprehensive travel insurance and check what circumstances and activities are not covered by your policy. Register your travel and contact details, so that you can be contacted in an emergency. 

Some safety advice:
* Avoid remote areas alone.
* Do not leave valuables in view in your car.
* Avoid unexpected offers of (seemingly free) guided tours. Ulterior motives are common.
* Do not patronise unlicensed taxis (taxi marrons). Some robbers use this trick to lure and attack their victims.

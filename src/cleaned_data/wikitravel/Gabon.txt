[http://www.en.legabon.org/index.php?m=3&s=4 '''Gabon'''] is a country in Western [[Central Africa]]. It lies on the Equator, on the Atlantic Ocean coast, between the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south and east, [[Equatorial Guinea]] to the northwest and [[Cameroon]] to the north.

A small population, as well as oil and mineral reserves have helped Gabon become one of Africa's wealthier countries. The country has generally been able to maintain and conserve its pristine rain forest and rich biodiversity.

==Understand==

===History===
The earliest inhabitants of the area were Pygmy peoples. They were largely replaced and absorbed by Bantu tribes as they migrated.

In the 15th century, the first Europeans arrived. The nation's present name originates from "Gabão", Portuguese for "cloak", which is roughly the shape of the estuary of the Komo River close to the capital of [[Libreville]]. French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza led his first mission to the Gabon-Congo area in 1875. He founded the town of Franceville, and was later colonial governor. Several Bantu groups lived in the area that is now Gabon when France officially occupied it in 1885.

In 1910, Gabon became one of the four territories of French Equatorial Africa, a federation that survived until 1959. These territories became independent on August 17, 1960. 

Since independence, Gabon has been one of the more stable African countries. Autocratic President Omar Bongo was in power from 1967 until his death in 2009. Gabon introduced a multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and for reforms of governmental institutions. A small population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous sub-Saharan African countries.  Despite being made up of more than 40 ethnic groups, Gabon has escaped the strife afflicting other West African states.

===Climate===
Tropical; always hot, humid. During the months of June to September, the climate is a little cooler (20-25°C).

===Terrain===
Narrow coastal plain; hilly interior; savannah in east and south. Highest point is Mont Iboundji at 1,575 metres.

===Important holidays===
'''Independence Day''': 17 August 1960 (from France)

'''National holiday''': Founding of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG), 12 March (1968)

[http://www.lietuva.lt/en/ '''Lithuania'''] (''Lietuva'') is a [[Baltic states|Baltic country]] in Northern [[Europe]]. It has a Baltic Sea coastline in the west and is surrounded by [[Latvia]] to the north, [[Belarus]] to the east, [[Poland]] to the southwest, and [[Russia]]'s exclave, the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], to the west.

Lithuania has been an active member of the European Union since 1&nbsp;May&nbsp;2004 and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 29&nbsp;March in that same year. 

Lithuania is the only Baltic country with more than eight hundred years of statehood tradition and its name was first mentioned one thousand years ago, in 1009. Wedged at the dividing line of Western and Eastern civilizations, Lithuania battled dramatically for its independence and survival. Once in the Middle Ages (15th century), Lithuania was the largest state in the entire continent of Europe, where crafts and overseas trade prospered.

In 1579, Vilnius University, an important scientific and education centre of the European scale, was opened. In the 16th century, Lithuania adopted its First, Second and Third Statutes. The Statutes were not only the backbone of the legislative system, they also had a major impact on the legislation of other European states of the time. Despite losing its independence, Lithuania managed to retain its Third Statute in force for as many as 250 years, which was instrumental in the preservation of national and civic self-awareness. The Constitution of Poland-Lithuania together with the French Constitution, both adopted in 1791, were the first constitutions in Europe (The Polish-Lithuanian constitution was adopted a few months earlier than the French).

===Climate===
Transitional, between maritime and continental with wet, moderate winters and summers.

===Terrain===
Lowland, many scattered small lakes, fertile soil. The fertile central plains are separated by hilly uplands that are ancient glacial deposits. 30% is covered in forest. The highest point is[http://www.virtualmountains.co.uk/esc/Lithuania/LI_Info.html Aukštojas Hill] at only 294m (967&nbsp;ft), about 24km southeast of [[Vilnius]] and lying just off the main highway to [[Minsk]] and within sight of the [[Belarus]] borders.

===History===
[[Image: Aerial view of Medininkai Castle.jpeg|thumb|Medininkai Castle: the upper construction of the walls was wooden and it was badly damaged by a major fire in the late 15th century.]]
Lithuania, first formed in the middle of the 13th century, was a huge feudal country stretching from the Baltic to the Black sea in the middle ages and in 1569 entered into a union with Poland to form a commonwealth.

Lithuania was part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth until the Polish Partitions in the 18th century when it became part of the Russian Empire.

===Independence===
Modern Lithuania gained its independence from Russia in 1918 following World War I and the dissolution of the Czarist monarchy. However, in 1940 Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but this proclamation was not generally recognized until September 1991, following the abortive coup in Moscow. The Soviet Union recognized Lithuania's independence on 6 September 1991. A constitution was adopted on 25 October 1992. The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently has restructured its economy for integration into Western European institutions.

===National Holidays===
There are State Holidays which all are days off by law, and there are red letter days which usually are regular weekdays honored or celebrated in different ways.

====State Holidays====
*'''New Year's Day''' (1 Jan) — typically starts in the evening of previous day (the last day of a year) like a private party; then, closer to a midnight, people go to the street or square to "meet the New Year" in a crowd. Depending on whether the winter is cold or mild, celebration is either enthusiastic or rather formal. The rest of day is spent like a regular weekend.
*'''Independence Day''' (16 Feb) - independence from Russian Empire in 1918 following World War I. Officially celebrated with all the ceremonies.

Various events are organized, especially in Semigallia and eastern Samogitia. Most of events take place near and on the hill forts which are common places alloted for such kind of events all over the country.

==Regions==
Regional differences of Lithuanian culture reflect the complicated historical development of the country. Since the thirteenth century five ethnographic areas, or regions, have historically formed in the current territory of Lithuania:

}}

These ethnographic regions even today differ by dialects, ways of life and behaviour styles, while until the turn of the last century there were pronounced differences in dress and homestead styles as well as village planning.

Lithuania is justly proud of its unfailing treasures of folklore: colorful clothing, meandering songs, an abundance of tales and stories, sonorous dialects and voluble language. This ethnographic heritage is nourished by ethnographic and folklore companies and barn theatres. Recent years have witnessed the revival of ethnographic crafts and culinary traditions. Folk craft fairs and live craft days are organized during many events and festivals.

==Transportation==
[[Image:Non-Schengen sector at Vilnius airport.jpeg|thumb|Non-Schengen sector at Vilnius airport]]
{{Schengen}}

===By plane===
Most airlines arrive at the main [http://www.vilnius-airport.lt/index.php?lang=en Vilnius International Airport] and some at the smaller, seaside [http://www.palanga-airport.lt/en/ Palanga Airport], while budget carriers such as [http://www.ryanair.com/ Ryanair] land in [http://www.kaunasair.lt/index.php?lang=2&m=2&p=210 Kaunas International Airport]. Kaunas airport also has a direct link with [[Warsaw]] by LOT. 

For destinations in Northern Lithuania, [[Riga]] Airport is an attractive option.

===By train===
There are train connections to [[Vilnius]] from [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]] and [[Kaliningrad]]. 

There are weekend trains from [[Kaunas]] to [[Białystok]] that are also connected with trains to [[Vilnius]] and [[Warsaw]].

[[Image:Via Baltika Kaunas.jpeg|thumb|Via Baltica passing Kaunas' suburbs]]

===By car===
Major "[[Via Baltica]]" road links [[Kaunas]] to [[Warsaw]] and [[Riga]]/[[Tallinn]]. The Baltic road, which links Vilnius to Tallinn, was just reconstructed. It is a very easy and pleasant route.
Overall, the major roads between the cities are of decent quality. Be extremely cautious when getting off the main roads in rural areas, as some of them may contain pot holes and general blemishes which could damage a regular car if you go too fast.
While driving between cities there are usually cafes and gas stations with bathrooms and snacks.

==Get around==
[[Image:Lazdenai railway stop.jpeg|thumb|Lazdėnai train stop at the edge of Neris Regional Park, an outdoor recreation area]]

===By train===
[http://www.litrail.lt/ Litrail] has services to major cities in Lithuania as well as to some small towns and villages which are difficult to reach by other public transport (eg popular holiday/weekend destinations in Dzūkija and Aukštaitija National Parks, Neris Regional Park and, [[Kretinga]] town, a final stop for those who are travelling to [[Palanga]] seaside resort by train). Fares are low compared to Western Europe: Vilnius-Kaunas costs about €5.20, with Vilnius-Klaipėda at approximately €15.

[[Image:Marijampole railway station.jpeg|thumb|Marijampolė railway station (built in 1924)]]
Many of the long distance trains have compartments which can accommodate six seated passengers or four sleeping passengers. The headrest can be lifted up to form a very comfortable bunk bed, which can be used while people are seated below. The seats themselves form the other pair of beds. As some journeys are quite long (about 5h in the case of [[Vilnius]]-[[Klaipėda]]), it is common to see people sleeping on the upper bunks during daytime journeys as well.

Generally the railway network is not considered as an alternative to the road network as it does not exactly duplicates the roads. As a result some places are more convenient to reach by train, some other places by bus, even if the railway and the highway are not far apart. Examples of the destinations which are more convenient to reach by train: Ignalina, a main point where the trip to Aukštaitija National Park begins; Kaunas' eastern part around the dam where several recreation areas and tourist objects are situated (one have to get off at Palemonas suburb). This makes the question "which one is better, train or bus?" rather hard to answer because it depends on the specifics.

[http://www.siaurukas.eu/ Narrow Gauge Railway] in Anykščiai offers short trips to a near-by lake. In summer it runs on  regular schedule, rest of the time tours must be booked in advance.

===By thumb===
[[Hitchhiking]] in Lithuania is generally good. Get to the outskirts of the city, but before cars speed up to the highway speeds.  The middle letter on the older licence plates (with Lithuanian flag) of the three letter code usually corresponds with the city of registration (V for Vilnius, K for Kaunas, L for Klaipeda, etc.). Newer licence plates (with EU flag) are not bound to city of registration in any way.

===By bus===
[[Image:Lithuania bus stop road signs.jpeg|thumb|Bus stop road signs for the three types of buses that provide passenger transport services between cities.]]
In Lithuania it is easy to move by buses and in practice, all the bigger even a little places can be reached with buses. The buses usually run more slowly than where a Western has got used due to if it is not a question of Ekspresas, the bus stops at every stop exactly. To be more precise, there are two types of bus lines (see below) and three types of the bus stops: "red" stops for "Ekspresas" buses (very few, the journey with "Ekspresas" is quick), "yellow" stops for the regular intercity buses, and the "blank" stops for suburban buses (very frequent, the journey is slow). The color is a color of a road sign for the bus stop. For example 40km the trip by suburban bus can last thus an hour. Some buses are old cars that have mainly been brought from the Nordic countries, some are new ones, it is not predictable which one you will get. Practically, when you travel the time is most important factor and the best decision is to take the closest bus which runs in the right direction. 

There is usually its own bus company on every town (district centre) and more than one company in the largest towns. Just to name few, [http://www.toks.lt/ TOKS] (long distance routes) and mini bus company [http://www.minibus.lt/tarpmiestiniai-marsrutai/ Transrevis] which will drive turns between [[Kaunas]] and [[Vilnius]], are based in [[Vilnius]]; [http://www.kautra.lt/ KauTra] (Kaunas Transport) additionally specializes in bicycle transfer service, though luggage compartments vary in size and not all types of bicycles always can fit in. The company offers the option to transport the bike to the agreed stop by the next bus with capacious compartment, informing you about the delivery by the short message to your cell phone. However, during the high season in summer popularity of this service is enormous, one should have that in mind if planning the trip by bicycle. [[Šiauliai]] company [http://www.busturas.lt/ Busturas], in addition to the regular routes, offers the tours to and from [[Riga]] ([[Latvia]]) via [http://rundale.net/en Rundale] which otherwise is inconvenient to visit from Lithuania. [http://www.klap.lt/ Klaipėda Bus Fleet ''(Klaipėdos autobusų parkas)''] is based in [[Klaipėda]] and serves mostly the routes in the Western part of the country as well as some international routes. There are also several smaller intercity and suburban bus companies in all the cities mentioned above.

For university and college students with Lithuanian student ID or EU ISIC (international student card), bus companies grant 50% discount.

The bulk of Lithuania's [http://www.autobusubilietai.lt  bus routes] and turns have been listed in an address from which you also can reserve the tickets for certain routes. However, pay attention to the fact that the payment system supports only some of the Lithuanian banks for the present and the credit card at the moment does not suit. 

The list above is only for the intercity buses, which generally is sufficient. There are two types of bus lines in Lithuania: intercity (''tarpmiestiniai'') buses and suburban (''priemiestiniai'') buses. This is reflected in the structure of the bigger bus stations, for example [[Vilnius]] bus station has two sections, a suburban "blue" one (blue color dominates in the timetables, destination plates on buses are written in blue) and a intercity "red" one (red colour dominates in the timetables, destination plates on buses are written in either blue or red). Thus, for example, "Trakai" direction has two platforms, a "red" one where intercity buses leave directly towards [[Trakai]], and a "blue" one where suburban buses leave to Trakai but run different routes, zig-zagging from village to village and finally arrive to Trakai. Similarly, at the Trakai bus station there are two platforms for "Vilnius" direction: blue one and red one. It is important to know that the "red" (intercity) bus always is faster. At the same time, intercity bus does not stop everywhere, for example the bus stop near the Hill of Crosses is for suburban buses only, if you wait there you can see many buses passing by but they won't stop there, you have to wait for a "blue" (suburban) bus. Schedules for suburban buses usually are put up separately from the schedules for intercity buses.     

For buses and trolley-buses on routes within towns and cities it is usual to buy the ticket from the driver. Recently the electronic ticketing has been introduced in major cities, but still the ticket can be obtained from the driver, though the types of tickets vary from town to town, for example in [[Vilnius]] you have to validate (stamp using one of the punches for paper tickets) the ticket obtained from the driver (thus you can buy several tickets and use them later), in other cities you get a one-ride ticket which already is valid for this particular ride. Inspectors periodically check tickets and will issue a fine if you cannot produce a correctly punched ticket or your electronic ticket is not valid. The bus is exited by the middle door and it is important to head for the door ''before'' the bus has stopped - it can be impossible to leave once people have started boarding; and if the driver sees that the bus stop outside is empty and nobody waits to leave the bus, the bus can skip the stop.

In addition to common buses run by municipality, many towns have private minibuses which usually operate express routes.

===By taxi===
Taxis run on a meter and can be booked by the phone numbers shown on the door of the taxi. Taxis are relatively cheap compared to western Europe. Some companies may not be as honest as others, common sense will keep you safe in this regard. It is common to ask about the approximate price to your destination in advance before boarding the taxi. If the answer does not satisfy you, you are not obliged to board this vehicle. Therefore, Lithuanians prefer to call the taxi by phone in order to know the price and the time of journey, and at the same time to be sure that the driver who will take them is aware of destination and the agreed price. However not all operators speak fluent English, nor drivers. On the other hand, people typically know more than one or two languages and know how to explain the relevant information without being fluent, this applies to drivers and passengers as only a minority of travellers from abroad are native English speakers.  

Taxi can also be booked online. Be aware that some inaccuracies may occur as the infrastructure construction and renovation works are carried out in all largest cities, the works affect the traffic. Depending on your destination there may be a necessity to choose a longer way, compared to that which was calculated. If you suspect some dishonesty you must know all circumstances for sure before starting the dispute with company or driver, otherwise it is common that you will be simply ignored as unreliable customer.

Each company has different prices, but roughly expect to pay around 30-75 cents/km. All taxis have also a fixed boarding fee in addition, so one should have that in mind before reaching any final conclusions.  

Taxi prices are highly dependent on fuel price which is constantly increasing recently, therefore all the figures above should be interpreted as approximate.

===By bicycle===
[[File:Bicycle path along the old road to Trakai, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|Bicycle path along the "Old Road" to Trakai.]]
Cycling in Lithuania is quite popular, however it depends on the exact location as in major cities pavements usually will have a bicycle pathways with numerous signs, although getting around by bicycle in rural areas might become a bit of a challenge. Two international [[EuroVelo cycling routes]] across the country, [http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-10/countries/lithuania EuroVelo No&nbsp;10] and [http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-11/countries/Lithuania EuroVelo No&nbsp;11], the former one equipped with quality signs and is of excellent quality, the latter one requires to have a map. 
* '''EuroVelo-10''' leads along the coast from [[Curonian Spit]] in the south to [[Latvia]]n border in the north. Keep in mind that only on several occasion you are able to see the sea from the bikepath: usually you have to do a short detour to the beach itself in order to see the water. The beach is sandy, the sand is very fine and often powdery that makes riding the bicycle rather difficult or impossible. There are no roads or paths on the beach, the coast itself is a natural value and under the State protection, there are various restrictions on the development of infrastructure. Therefore the beach all along the sea retains its natural, sometimes genuinely pristine characteristics and appearance. The bike path is constructed slightly away from the sea, softly winds across the dunes and forests allowing to see the most interesting corners of the area.
* '''EuroVelo-11''' crosses eastern part of the country from south to north, with the capital city [[Vilnius]] in the middle. The southern end is at Lazdijai border crossing point (N54°9'25.88" E23°28'21.84"); after entering the country you soon have to make a sharp turn to the south (before the lake, N54°10'5.67" E23°28'39.13") and ride along the border down the unpaved border track. This one was a part of Soviet Union external border zone infrastructure, now not in use for its intended purposes. There is a possibility to make a shortcut using a recently recreated ancient connection between Berżniki (PL) and Kapčiamiestis (LT) villages, border crossing point at N54°2'46.49" E23°31'31.32" (road No 2505) in the middle of a large Dzukian forest . You soon cross the same border track and proceed to ride to Kapčiamiestis.

Northern end of EuroVelo-11 bikepath crosses Latvian border at N55°40'30.59" E26°34'59.98" just before ''Grivočka'' hamlet on Latvian side.  Before the border the path is meaningfully winding across the pleasant environment among the lakes and hills and leads you through the town of ''Visaginas'' and village of ''Tilžė'', both of unusual history, towards Latvian city [[Daugavpils]]. 

Keep in mind, that although it is possible to get from Vilnius to, say, [[Riga]], taking a road A2 which leads directly from Vilnius towards Riga, there hardly can be worse and more senseless decision as the road is designed specifically for cars across the flat and boring environment, away from any object that can distract the driver. It is equally true about all the other main roads.

When staying in the country it is more common and reasonable to get to the certain region or area and explore it in more detail, rather than cycling across from one end to another. In the latter case, the most of time would be spent on roads that are friendly for cars and not very healthy for cyclists; distances between the outdoor recreation areas are rather long and not too scenic, whilst recreation areas, in contrast, are quite diverse and often puzzling. This adds attractiveness to recreation areas, but requires more time and flexibility, also some basic knowledge about the place itself.

State Department of Tourism has issued a booklet for domestic needs with a description of 16 most attractive cycling routes all along the country. A downloadable [http://www.lithuania.travel/uploads/files/dir35/dir1/3_0.php English version of a booklet] introduce you to them and also supply with the maps of all of them. 

''Essential tip: don't leave your bicycle outside without locking it in, unless you are riding outside the settlements. Within any city or a smallest village always lock your bicycle, even if you are going to the store for cigarettes, even if you know for sure that your bike will constantly be in a field of view.''

More detailed information and help can be provided by the international bicycle project [http://www.balticcycle.eu BaltiCCycle]. It also can give you ideas about the other and more sophisticated routes in different regions of the country or within the cities that are not described in the booklet or elsewhere. Lithuanian version of this website, [http://velovilnius.lt/veloland/marsrutai/ Veloland.Lt], can be investigated using online translator – what you need to find there is the detailed maps of the routes (you have to select the region first from a drop-down menu ''“Maršrutai”''). Many of the routes are remote but, surprisingly, often accessible quite easily and are no less attractive than more popular ones. For example, [http://velovilnius.lt/veloland/files/2013/02/3trasa.pdf this downloadable map] describes a 35km/5h route in a very attractive area of Dzūkija forest: the starting/ending point is in Marcinkonys village which can be reached from Vilnius by train, the bikes can be brought with you or hired in advance at Marcinkonys itself.

Lithuanian traffic moves on the right and, as with most of the world, all distances are posted in km.

Headlights are mandatory and must be kept on at all times when driving.

Wearing the seat-belt is mandatory for both driver and passengers.

A vehicle is required by law to stop at a zebra crossing if there is a pedestrian who obviously is going to cross the street but still didn't step from a sidewalk.

The alcohol limit is up to 0.4‰ for the drivers who have at least 2 years of driving experience of category B vehicle; 0.0‰ for others.

The road network in Lithuania is fairly good, especially the motorways. The quality of road surface on minor roads can vary. The improvement work hampers traffic in many places. The [[Via Baltica]] road goes through Lithuania from south ([[Poland]]) to north ([[Latvia]]). Other important roads are the A1 (Vilnius-Klaipėda) and the A2 (Vilnius-Panevėžys).

The A2 (European route code E272) road has motorway status with 130km/h speed limit during summer and 110km/h during winter, the road length is 136km. There are 6 spots along the road where the speed is reduced from 130 to 110 km/h: the U-turns with separate deceleration lanes are constructed there. These are needed for sparse local inhabitants and emergency services, while regular traffic is not supposed to use them.

The A1 (European route code E85) is the longest (311km) highway in the country, completed in 1987. Its western section between Klaipėda and Kaunas has motorway status with 130km/h speed limit during summer and 110km/h during winter, and its eastern section between Kaunas and Vilnius has expressway status with 120km/h speed limit during summer and 110km/h during winter. It is planned that this section too will be given the status of the motorway in c. 2018, when the installation of connecting roads and overpasses and the reconstruction of individual stretches of this section will be fully completed. There are two relevant U-turns left on this road: one at the western edge of Vilnius, another one at the western edge of Kaunas.

Most of the other highways and regional roads have 1+1 lanes and a 90km/h speed limit outside settlement limits. Within settlement the speed limit usually is 50km/h.

Moving domestic animals and roe animals may cause dangerous situations on the rural roads. The motorways are almost entirely fenced up to protect from wild animals, secondary roads have the signs warning about possibilities of such collisions. Drivers who are not used to that must be ''very'' alert as collisions with elks, although rare, may be lethal. Potentially the most dangerous time, when even the fence can succumb, is in May and October, between 18:00 and 01:00.

Fixed speed cameras are frequent along country roads and motorways, usually near crossroads or pedestrian crossings, and in cities. These are usually announced by a sign. Many of them appear to be designed to be turned around from time to time, watching the opposite direction.

Roundabouts are a feature of the Lithuanian road network, particularly in the cities. Recently many small (or "midi-") roundabouts were installed at the crossroads of regional roads. Visitors from countries where this type of junction is uncommon or not used at all, may find the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout Wikipedia article on roundabouts] useful.

'''In the cities:''' unlike many European countries, but similar to North American practice, turning right at a red traffic light is allowed ''where indicated by a "green arrow"'' (square white sign next to the red light, containing a green arrow indicating the permitted direction), after a full stop and provided that it does not endanger pedestrians and other traffic. Be aware that the absence of such a sign means that turning right on red is not allowed, and the police will stop any driver seen breaking this rule. It is scheduled to remove all "green arrows" until 2020, while gradually installing the smart traffic lights. 

Many bigger city junctions have a separate green light for traffic turning left, but no red light. The green light for the other directions shows arrows going straight and to the right, but you need to look closely to make them out.

Traffic rules equally apply to both pedestrians and drivers, therefore the pedestrian violator has no advantage over the vehicle driver. This especially is relevant in cities: if you walk on a carriageway part of the street, you have to be alert and leave this part of the street if the car is approaching, otherwise it's your fault if accident happens.

'''Driving:''' on two- or three- lane roads, it is polite to move out of the right-hand lane (if safe to do so) when you intend to travel straight ahead; this keeps the right-hand lane clear for right-turning traffic. When moving back to the right hand lane watch out for fast-moving vehicles approaching from behind.

On 1+1 lane highways without barrier be careful of the overtaking cars: the driver behind you may suddenly find the oncoming car is coming too close and decided to get back to your lane - you have to predict that. You are supposed to keep the speed and move a bit to the right so that the car behind could see what's in front of him clearly, and he will overtake you when it's feasible. When driver overtakes you, he wants to get back to the lane as fast as possible, and this may seem as if he is tailgating you. Keep calm, it's not hostility.

==Talk==
The official language of Lithuania is [[Lithuanian phrasebook|Lithuanian]], making up one of only two languages (along with [[Latvian phrasebook|Latvian]]) on the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family. Despite the kinship of Lithuanian to many other European languages, the archaic nature of its grammar makes it hard for foreigners unfamiliar with the language to form even basic sentences. 

English is generally well spoken and preferred foreign language by the younger generations. The older generations might have just the very basic spoken English skills and it be especially difficult for them to understand strong English accents (written English might help). Most people of the older generation know Russian (this is not necessary the case amongst the youth, who might know only very basic Russian), especially in Klaipėda, Vilnius and eastern districts of the country. Polish is somewhat understood in certain areas of Vilnius as well as south-east and southern districts of the country. German is spoken or understood better than elsewhere in Klaipėda, Neringa, Palanga and Šventoji. Keep in mind that all this is just a generalization and should be not applied blindly. For example, if you're in Vilnius and the young person you try to talk to in English language can't understand you and shakes his head, it does not mean that information provided above is inaccurate. You can't know all specifics: this young person may be a student who arrived from the northern district of the country where the French traditionally is taught as a foreign language at schools. He may not know English or can't understand your pronunciation. There may be elderly person just next to you who may be fluent in English only because he or she worked in UK for several years. This applies countrywide: communication skills in foreign languages depend on the person and vary greatly. Differences and specifics by regions and cities are provided above, it means that chances to communicate in one or another language are greater in a corresponding region or city. Whether you will be understood depends on concrete person and your pronunciation. Those travelers who learn a few basic phrases of the local language are always amply awarded with good will and appreciation for their efforts, however sometimes it may be tricky: if your accent makes those local phrases unrecognizable you probably will be awarded blank face and a shy smile. 

In case you managed to master some spoken Lithuanian, it may be extremely beneficial if you have any long-term or deeper interests. Just be prepared, that you will be learning the so called Standard Lithuanian, understood by all. However if local people respond in a local dialect you may understand nothing, especially outside the largest cities. You have then to say: I'm from city, I have only learned the "city Lithuanian" - and the wide smile on local person's face will testify that you are on a right way.

In case you're quite indifferent to national identities, simply remember that you are in Lithuania, not in a Russian colony and no longer in the Soviet Union: Lithuanians won't appreciate your efforts to stress your indifference.

The most southern of the Baltic countries, Lithuania's historic heritage sets it quite apart from the other two. Visiting this small but colourful country today, few travellers might guess that this was once the largest nation in [[Europe]]. A few monuments remind of those golden ages, when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania stretched out far into modern day [[Russia]], [[Poland]] and [[Moldova]], but even fewer are still inside the Lithuanian borders. The archeologic site of '''[[Kernavė]]''', long ago a medieval capital, is now a World Heritage Site and has historic hillfort mounds as well as a museum. The '''Trakai Island Castle''' in [[Trakai]] is sometimes called "Little Mariënburg". It's located on an island and was one of the main strongholds in the prime days of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Although it was severely damaged in 17th century wars with Muscovy, the castle was beautifully restored in the 20th century and is now a popular tourist sight. '''Kaunas Castle''' in [[Kaunas]] is even older, but only a fourth of the original building remains.

The country's lovely capital, '''[[Vilnius]]''', is a small but pleasant place with a UNESCO listed historic centre. It's the perfect place to admire a range of '''architectural styles''', as it boasts a mixture of gothic, renaissance, baroque and neoclassical buildings. Stroll through the narrow streets and cosy courtyards and kick back for a coffee in one of the many cafés on Pilies Street. Then, walk down Gediminas Avenue, the town's main street lined with governmental buildings and theatres, towards the old neighbourhood of '''Žvėrynas'''. With some 65 churches, the famous '''Gediminas Tower''', the '''Cathedral Square''', the '''Royal Palace''', the '''Presidential Palace''' and many other monuments and museums, you won't run out of things to see in Vilnius any time soon.

For a day at the sea, the popular seaside resort of '''[[Palanga]]''' is the place to be. Although it gets crowded in summer, it has some great beaches and beautiful sand dunes. Sand dunes overgrown with pine forest is also what you'll find at the almost 100km long '''[[Curonian Spit]]''', which separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea coast. It's a World Heritage Site shared between Lithuania and Russia and is best explored from the large port city '''[[Klaipėda]]''', though there is a possibility to stay on the Spit itself in one of the four fishermen villages. Not far from Klaipėda is the village of Juodkrantė, which is famous for its '''Hill of Witches''', decorated with sculptures from the country's legends and tales. Farthermost on Lithuanian half is the fishermen's town of [[Nida]], it is praised for its shores, ancient ethnographic cemetery and high sand dunes in vicinity. Klaipėda is also a good hub to other seaside resorts on the Baltic Coast, less known but equally cosy, such like Karklė. Nice bicycle path stretches north and south from Klaipėda, as well as along all Curonian Spit. 

A few kilometers from the northern city [[Šiauliai]] you'll find the remarkable '''Hill of Crosses''', which is an extraordinary and popular pilgrimage site. Over a 100.000 crosses - small, huge, simple and exuberant - have been placed here by faithful from far and wide. On the other side of the country, in the very south, you'll find the popular and classy spa resort town of [[Druskininkai]], surrounded by largest pine forest in the country.

Like it's Baltic neighbours, Lithuania has a lot to offer for '''nature''' lovers. Dense forests, hills, beautiful blue lakes and rivers are the main base. The forested '''Aukštaitija National Park''' is perhaps the most popular of the country's national parks for its balanced diversity of natural and cultural values. Its forests are home to elk, deer and wild boar. Some of the pines you'll see here are up to 200 years old and the park is a safe haven for many plants and birds that are endangered in the rest of the country. The 126 lakes and countless streams in between them make the park a great place for water sports activities and the villages in the park have some interesting wooden churches. Southwest from the national park lies a one of the largest forests, famous Labanoras Forest, which is a part of [http://labanoras.am.lt '''Labanoras Regional Park'''] - and there is more rare plants, more rare birds, including Black Stork, Capercailye, Crane and few species of eagles, more rare animals like Lynx and Wolf, 285 lakes (70 of them swimmable), mysterious swamps and numerous rivers and streams suitable for canoeing. No surprise that its popularity among holidaymakers exceeds even popularity of its neighbor Aukštaitija National Park. 
Another favorite regional park, especially among the birders, is the [http://www.nemunodelta.lt/ '''Nemunas Delta''']. The vast wetlands around the place where Neman River reaches the Baltic Sea are a popular eco-tourism destination and an important bird habitat.

===Natural scenery===
Lithuanians describe their land with the help of poetry. Poetry and songs are filled with romantic images of gently rolling hills, vast valleys and meandering rivers, somber forests rich of animals, meadows full of butterflies and the birds singing in the sky. This embodies what the Lithuanian is looking for and is happy when he finds it. This is what the Lithuanian is willing to promote and defend. And when Lithuanians abroad begin to feel homesickness – this is homesickness for all such scenery and everything else related to it. This is, according to many Lithuanians, the highest value of the country. Consequently, if you are after all this, you can experience more than you had expected, however this can be quite a challenging experience. You have to be well prepared and probably to rent a car. You can see, hear and touch everything that is described in Lithuanian poetry and songs, but how you will perceive it depends on you and circumstances, which often are unpredictable. And this is a part of modern Lithuanian myths and urban legends as well: unpredictable circumstances. One of the first things that travelers from the West notice is the lack of infrastructure and facilities in the recreation areas. And there is no reason to expect any improvements or changes in this respect in the future: Lithuanians tend to make the difference between the "urban habitat" and the "visits to the nature", the latter is supposed to be a rough experience, a visit to the natural, not necessarily pristine or well maintained, but naturally strong and lively environment without the attributes of urban life, it should contrast with the daily routine of the city resident. Visiting the nature is supposed to be a way of gaining vital energy. Therefore you must to "pave your path" through the woods as if you were a pathfinder – each time again and again – so that ultimately you are affected by elements of nature even against your will or laziness. Locals would tell you that if you don’t want to make any effort you don’t deserve to step outside the city. But if some effort is not a big trouble to you, all those gently rolling hills, vast valleys and meandering rivers, somber forests, meadows full of butterflies and the birds singing in the sky are almost every time guaranteed.

*'''Regional Parks''': there are 30 [http://www.qrz.lt/lyff/regioniniai%20parkai_eng.htm Regional Parks] in the country total. Some of them are mentioned in the text above, some can be found below. Regional and National Parks represent most valuable environments of the country and are popular outdoor recreation destinations among people of Lithuania and neighbouring countries. Some territories and areas within those parks have additional restrictions of various degree (nature reserves and preserves), like well-known Čepkeliai Bog and [http://www.visitneringa.com/en/main/places?id=58949  Nagliai Nature Preserve] (also known as Dead or Grey Dunes), or lesser known ones like [http://viesvile.lt/zemelapiai.html Viešvilė State Nature Preserve]. Some parks are more oriented to the visitors in sense that the lower restrictions and characteristics of environment itself allow to install some kind of infrastructural, recreational and entertaining objects; some other parks prefer to leave the visitors on their own without the comforts of civilization. Visitor is supposed to be able to make a choice. This part may be difficult for people from the countries where the visitors should be offered.

*'''Scenery and the roads'''. Traveling down the main roads is dull and boring. The roads, among other features, are treated as the objects that damage and pollute the natural environment; therefore the modern roads are built across the former pastures and agricultural lands, bypassing smaller settlements at "respectable distance", which means that you can barely see them from the road. Older roads, with reconstructed pavement, are also in use. For example, the motorway A1 [[Kaunas]]-[[Klaipėda]] loosely duplicates the Samogitian Highway ''(Žemaičių plentas)'' which was opened in 1939, and which can be recognized as a winding secondary road connecting all the district centres slightly north of the road A1 on the section that begins before [http://www.ariogala.lt/miestas-2/ Ariogala] (NW of [[Kaunas]]) and ends up after [https://www.facebook.com/gargzdai Gargždai] near [[Klaipėda]]. To some extent such secondary roads are more diverse and more interesting, however the speed is lower and the time costs are higher. Some objects of interest are easy to miss, some others are still away from the road. Traveling by train reduces opportunities of sightseeing to a minimum: the rows of trees are planted along the railway tracks to form a green barrier in order to separate the railway infrastructure from the surrounding space. The rare breaks between the trees let to enjoy the scenery for several seconds or minutes. 
:There are several roads in the country that are scenic and pleasant to drive. Regardless of what objects are or are not on these roads, they can be treated as a separate objects of interest: all you need is just to relax and drive. Lithuania is not a country of outstanding beauty or extraordinary objects; its natural beauty is soft, unpretentious and relaxing. The scenic roads are:

*'''[http://www.piliakalniai.lt Hill-forts]'''. This is the one of most common objects of interest and type of landmarks for Lithuanians. If you want to go “somewhere” other than the lake or river for the outdoor recreation purposes and nothing comes to mind as “where to go”, there always is a hill-fort or its surroundings suitable for leisure pursuits. Total number of the hill-forts, or ''piliakalniai'' (nominative plural), in Lithuania is 840, the latest one was indentified in 1997.
:There are several types of early hill-forts that date from the Bronze Age BC to 13th century AD, they all have flattened hilltop defensive positions; and two types of hill-forts built for defensive purposes against the raids of German Crusaders between 13th and 15th centuries, their hilltop defensive positions are irregular. The latter type of two is motte-and-bailey castles, for example the [http://www.piliakalniai.lt/piliakalnis.php?piliakalnis_id=123 Second Hillfort of Veliuona], now partially washed out by Nemunas river. Construction of castles and other elements of the fortifications were made of wood and stone, nothing has survived to date. Later the few brick castles were built, but by that time the firearms and new methods of warfare made such type of castles unsuitable for defensive purposes, they were abandoned and eventually only the hills remained. The scenery of Lithuania has changed: the settlements have “climbed down” from the hilltops to the foothills and hid in groves. This is what you see driving through the rural areas: the road winding among the scattered groves, several farms here and there in a distance, and eventually you see the steeple of the church above the grove, betraying the presence of town still hidden behind the trees. Somewhere aside an old hill-fort marks its previous location. You can climb it up and the view that unfolds before the eyes often (but not always) is a literal embodiment of Lithuanian songs and poetry.
:On the country’s and regional maps the hill-forts are marked with an icon resembling the shape of some kind of a mound from the side or from above. The map legends are typically bilingual or multilingual, in Lithuanian language only the one term is used, ''piliakalnis'' (nominative singular), and English translations vary: hill fort, mound or castle hill means one and the same, the hill-fort. 

:Several notable hill-forts are widely known throughout the country, their names conclude the names of organizations, schools and companies, and of course they are in the spotlight of vacationists and organized excursions:

* '''Cow's Cave''' ''(Karvės ola)'' - a well-type almost round funnel-formed sinkhole, the most notable one out of 9,000 sinkholes that have been identified in the area of Biržai district, Northern Lithuania. At the top its diameter reaches up to 10m, the depth is about 19m, of which 7m is under the water. In the bottom of the sinkhole at the depth of 9.5m there is an underground cavity opened instead of melted gypsum; this cavity splits up into several caves that were explored by speleologists and cave divers from [[Kaunas]] in 1973 and 1978. There are five caves: ''the Wet Cave (Šlapioji ola)'', ''the Narrow Burrow (Siauroji landa)'', ''the Bat Burrow (Šikšnosparnių landa'' - several bats have been found here), ''the Toad's Cave (Rupūžės ola)'' with a small underground lake of about 1.5m depth and ''the Lustrous Cave (Blizganti ola)''. The water level in the bottom of underground cavity is variable, the water temperature reaches 4.5°C. In 2007 the joint expedition of Lithuanian caving club "Aenigma" and caving club "Sokolniki-RUDN" from Moscow explored the Cow's Cave in detail and discovered a new hall, 15m in width. It was noted that cave diving in sinkholes is extremely complex and requires a high level of professionalism, this also means that average cave diver with good skills can't get a permit to explore this sinkhole.

The bottom of the pit is walkable, however it is rather soft as that what looks like a bottom is a top of 9.5m height peat layer which is still in early stage of formation. A light fog, supposedly slightly toxic, tends to form early in the morning and in the evening. It is not recommended to stay for a long time at the bottom as you may start to feel yourself a little weird, though there is no official statistics or researches about the consequences of such an effect. Research conducted by Physics PhD's reveal that "This is especially active place where intersects the structures of strong and diverse geological biofields". Around and inside the pit there is a number of virtually healthy trees with the growth anomalies. The pit is ready for visits; there is an observation deck at the edge and a path leading around and inside it. Devil’s Pit has been declared as geological monument since 1964.

* '''[[Urbex|Urban Exploration]]'''. 31&nbsp;Aug&nbsp;1993 the last Soviet soldier left the territory of Lithuania. Vast areas that have been used for military purposes, has been abandoned. Thereafter Lithuanian military took over some objects and territories, redesigned and reconstructed them to meet NATO standards, and this represents about 40% of the territories and objects previously used by Soviet military. Some 60% of enemy's military bases were left to decay. Today, all of them yet to be explored, but the ruthless effects of time and Mother Nature are already clearly visible. The sites suitable for Urban Exploration consist of 2 main groups of the former Soviet military objects and territories: ''1'' - KGB object in Linksmakalnis and its affiliate, and ''2'' -  properties of Soviet 58th Missile Division (HQ in Karmėlava) and 29th Missile Division (HQ in Tauragė, later in Šiauliai) of 5th Missile Army. Some of the former firing grounds were converted into the biosphere grounds and recreation zones suitable for the eco-tourism.

::* '''Linksmakalnis''' aka '''Lustberg'''. It was a former manor estate turned into the KGB radio intelligence center which was served by the secret military unit 71272. One non-combat subunit was responsible for the infrastructure, three combat subunits were responsible for political and economical intelligence in West Germany and Scandinavia. Preconditions for the existence of such a center were created by Europeans themselves: in order to save the state budget it was decided for confidential communications not to use the separate wireline channels (very expensive), but to use the ordinary commercial channels instead, encoding messages with a special chip. However, the chip did not become an obstacle. In 16&nbsp;Jun&nbsp;1993 the secret unit was moved to the new unknown location and changed its subordination and number.

* <see name="Mythological stones" alt="" address="" directions="" lat="" long="" phone="" tollfree="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price=""> Are probably most tangible witnesses of the pagan past that survived until modern times. It is known about the 600 mythological stones in the country. Their origins, shapes, purposes and associated legends vary. Lithuanian soils are unevenly podzolized, mostly fertile and cultivated, while sandy soils cover about one-fourth of the country’s territory – you are supposed to make sure that Lithuania has no rocks, and even stones are rather rare birds. Majority of them partially or entirely rest beneath the ground, some protrude outward. And some are quite sizeable. These are well known and held in respect just as a cool natural phenomena, but among them there are stones which are something more than just that. Even in 19th until the middle of 20th century during Christian religious holidays many people used to gather by the mythological stones in large numbers, sacrificing various items and money, praying for health and happiness. Even today you can wing the sacred ''Bradeliškės Stone'' in ''Airėnai'', Vilnius district, and you will always find the coins left on it. All regional maps have an icon “mythological” or “prominent stone” in the legend’s section “objects of interest”; the more detailed is the map, the more of mythological stones are marked on it. During short one or few days trips Lithuanians like to visit country's famous and mysterious places, and stones here go without saying. Such trips are done by combining various modes of transport, also on foot. Some even famous stones are quite remote or just are hard to locate, so attempts alone to find them are quite an adventure. 

<br/>'''There are different types of mythological stones'''; all of them have their given names. There are several large stones in different locations, called ''Mokas'', the name’s meaning is a cross between a soothsayer and a scholar. It is supposed that the sorcerers and priests used to gain certain knowledge from them. Stones named ''Mokas'' possess some ancient wisdom, so what Lithuanians do is just visit them, or, like they say, “see them”. You don’t need to do anything, ''Mokas'' will do what must be done, that is, your biofield will be (or will be not) affected in certain way, and whether you gain something entirely depends on your inner self. Apart those large stones there are many slightly smaller ones with attributed healing powers, it is supposed that healing effects can occur when there is a necessity. 

<br/>'''There are stones with pits'''. During 14-17 centuries the pagan shrines had in their sites the stones of cylindrical shape with engraved flat-bottomed bowls which gathered sacred water. It is supposed that the stones were also used to stoke a sacred fire. Later were prevailing the midsize flat surface stones with the pointed-bowls, it is believed they had to safeguard the grain, livestock and happiness of home. They now are sparsely scattered everywhere across the country, some can be found in the churchyards.

<br/>'''A separate group is foot-printed stones'''. The truth is that they are lacking of scientifical data. Their origins are usually associated with minor goddesses and gods, such like woodland fairies - the ''Laumės'' (nom., plur., feminine) and devils - the ''Velniai'' (nom., plur., masculine). Other Baltic deities and elementals also may be involved, depends on particular stone and location. The ''Laumės Akmuo'' (Woodland Fairy Stone), for example, has several indentations of supposedly not artificial origin: the smaller ones remind the footprints of the fairy and the baby, the largest one, although sometimes is called a “cow’s footprint”, is shaped rather like a devil’s footprint. Here it is worth mentioning that Baltic devils were rather common creatures living in the woods and swamps throughout the country, you should not be mistaken by other definitions. One of the stories tell that the intendation was left by cow who managed to imprint it, another tale tells rather standard story about the devil who carried a stone and lost it. People were witnessing the woodland fairies washing clothes near the stone in the river, not only at night but even in day time. Once a local hireling girl saw a soldier who suddenly disappeared as soon as she crossed herself. Near the ''Laumės Akmuo'' on the other side of the river there is a Christian site of Lourdes, installed supposedly on the pagan sanctuary. The stone is located approximately 300m to the west of ''Kartena'' hill-fort with archaeological site of the ancient settlement which dates back to 600-1100 AD. Coordinates 55°54′38″N, 21°28′15″E, easily accessible by the A11 highway.

<br/>'''Finally, there are cursed and turned to stone humans'''. Some of them probably are the echo of romanticized love stories, some others – who knows now - may be the outcome of the actual curse… At first the curse causes a sudden death, the next moment an actual sorcery comes into force: the inner self of a man is trapped into something solid that crystallizes and acquires the appearance of something that visually reminds a hard piece of the earth's crust. Lifeless body is buried in the cemetery or outside it, while the fate of trapped soul remains uncertain. Sometimes it haunts, sometimes it moves, and sometimes everything calms down.

Concerning religion, Lithuanian rulers were very flexible. Some tended to Catholicism, others to Orthodox, and some were changing religions like clothes depending on trend. Finally, on 19 April 1389, Pope Urban VI recognized the status of Lithuania as a Roman Catholic state. A direct consequence of this was that German Orders lost any legal reasons to continue their crusades to Lithuania. Some say that Lithuania was forced to accept Christianity, some others can say that Christian Europe was forced to recognize Lithuania, but if the measure of progress is human life, then it was beneficial for all.

* '''[http://www.hubertus.lt/ Hunting and fishing]''' — Commercial hunting and fishing is allowed, popular, well organized and under control, and virtually does not make damage to nature. Poaching is strictly illegal, though still happens, even to the extent of organized crime. However it has a very negative attitude among entire society, intolerance to such kind of crimes is constantly increasing.

* '''Water tourism''' in warm season is one of the most popular forms of leisure activities among lithuanians. Depending on place, chosen water route and preferences you can choose specifically canoeing, kayaking, boating or rafting.  

[[Image:Canoeing in Minija2009-06-16.jpeg|thumb|Canoeing in Minija river near Raguviškiai, Kretinga district.]]

:Lithuanian terms:
::'''raft''' – ''plaustas'' (nom., sing.) or ''plaustai'' (nom., plur.);
::'''boat''' – ''valtis'' (nom., sing.) or ''valtys'' (nom., plur.);
::'''kayak''' – ''kajakas'' (nom., sing.) or ''kajakai'' (nom., plur.);
::'''canoe''' – ''baidarė'' (nom., sing.) or ''baidarės'' (nom., plur.).

:'''Rafting''' usually involves using inflatable rafts and is popular among lovers of passive recreation: fishermen who spend their time angling in the lakes, and groups of holidaymakers who are travelling down the largest rivers (''Nemunas, Neris, Nevėžis'' and ''Žeimena'') in a low pace. 

:'''Boating''' is common everywhere in the countryside in all water bodies; homesteads of countryside tourism typically are equipped with boats that allow the visitors to enjoy the lake and scenery by slowly rowing the boat. This activity doesn't require much effort, is safe and suitable for all family members.

:'''Kayak''' in Lithuania is mostly comprehended as a ''one seater whitewater kayak'' specifically. It is used for creeking in the fast-flowing rivers, particularly during spring tides. For example, river ''Dūkšta'' (incline 12&nbsp;m per&nbsp;km) every spring becomes almost like a mountain rivulet and is used by extreme sports enthusiasts to exercise before more serious expeditions. The list of other rivulets suitable for creeking in high tide period: ''Tenenys, Veiviržas'' (both tributaries of ''Minija''), ''Luknė, Kirkšnovė, Gynėvė''  (all 3 are tributaries of ''Dubysa''), ''Alovė, Armena, Lapainia'' (all 3 are tributaries of ''Nemunas''), ''Širvinta'' and ''Rausvė'' (tributaries of ''Šešupė''), ''Anykšta, Armona, Indraja'' (all 3 are tributaries of ''Šventoji''), ''Plaštaka'' (tributary of ''Siesartis''), ''Bražuolė'' and ''Saidė'' (tributaries of ''Neris''), ''Nedzingė'' (tributary of ''Merkys''), ''Šventelė'' (tributary of ''Žeimena''), upper reaches of ''Venta''.

:'''Canoeing''' is a most common and universal type of water tourism in the country. A short explanation of Lithuanian general name of a boat ''“baidarė”'', and how it differs from ''“kanoja”'', may have some practical value if you are going to rent the one. The name ''baidarė'' comes from the ''Aleutian kayak'' and applies to both racing and recreational kayaks, and to both frame and inflatable kayaks. It is a name of a narrow two seater boat which has a cockpit. The other Lithuanian name ''“kanoja”'', it is ''canoe'',  applies exclusively to ''"sit-on-top" kayaks''. Therefore the names “canoe” and “canoeing” is used here as a general term in order to distinguish it from  the “whitewater kayak” which is not common in Lithuania. 
:There are many different companies across the country that offer canoe rental, usually you can choose from several different types and models. Pay attention that English translation may be rather loose and the name ''“baidarė”'' may be translated differently on different websites. You should focus on the pictures and decide whether you need a “two seater cockpit kayak” (''baidarė''), "sit-on-top" kayak (''kanoja''), or a proper “one seater whitewater kayak” (''kajakas'').

[[Image:Ula river, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|Canoeing in Ūla River, Dzūkija National Park.]]

:Since canoe rental is a seasonal business, some companies switch to the ski rental during the winter time and appear with a different name next spring. You may want to search for canoe rentals independently, so here below are the four main key words to search in Lithuanian language and their literal English equivalents which may differ from what you are used to:

::: ''baidarės'' (canoes), 
::: ''baidarių nuoma'' (rent of canoes), 
::: ''baidarės nuomai'' (canoes for rent),
::: ''vandens turizmas'' (water tourism).

'''Places to go canoeing'''

Usually every rental company offers the certain routes in certain rivers. You can choose the desirable region or a concrete river or lake and arrange your stay in some larger town there, the boats will be delivered to the agreed point and taken back after your journey. Alternatively, if you plan to stay in the certain city and have no concrete idea about the rivers, there always is some suitable water route not so far away from any city, just ask the company for suggestions.
If you want to plan the trip yourself and need something to start with, one of the practical ways is to select your river or lake route using [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Vandens-turizmas-%C5%BEem%C4%97lapi%C5%B3-serija-baidarininkams/134840009892174 series of the 9 water-proof/tear-proof maps] issued specifically for canoeists: you will know for sure that you have a map, you’ll be sure that all of those nine places are the most popular places for such kind of activities, and you’ll know where exactly you have to start and where you are supposed to finish.

===Pilgrimages===
Pilgrimage places define the geographical area within which the place is known and from which pilgrims are drawn. The location of nature objects, such as mounds, forests, trees, stones and water embodied the network of sacred places in the pre-Christian Lithuania. The ancient Balts had their own center of pilgrimage Rickoyto ''(Romuva)'', its geographical locality is still unknown. It is, that the trinity of Baltic gods – ''Perkūnas'' (Thunder God), ''Patrimpas'' (Fertility God) and ''Pikuolis'' (Underworld God) – were venerated under the old and high-powered oak at that place.
The 16th-17th centuries are the formative period of the network of Christian pilgrimage places in Lithuania. [[Trakai]], Šiluva, Gate Of Dawn ''(Aušros Vartai)'', Samogitian Calvary ''([[Žemaičių Kalvarija]])'', [[Vilnius]] Calvary were the main pilgrimage centers as well as Vilnius Cathedral (veneration of Saint Casimir). The new pilgrimage places refreshed the network in the 18th–19th centuries, the Hill of Crosses, an ancient [http://www.piliakalniai.lt/piliakalnis.php?piliakalnis_id=512 hill-fort of Jurgaičiai], became one of them when after uprising of 1831 and 1863 the crosses had been built in the memory of dead.
The places of apparitions of Virgin Mary complement the network of pilgrimage places in the 20th century exclusively. The obstruction for pilgrimage to the sacred places either places of apparitions was evident in the soviet era; several places (Vilnius Calvary, The Hill of Crosses, Janoniai Spring in Anykščiai district ) were destroyed physically.
The 23 main catholic pilgrimage places can be grouped at the present time. Most of them are bound with the cult of Virgin Mary (12 – the worship places of images of Holy Mary, 3 – places of apparitions, 1 – the place of coronet image and apparition). The second groups – Calvaries (5 places, the Samogitian Calvary has the miraculous image too), the places of saints and cult of holy persons (4 places, the Cathedral of Vilnius has the coronet image of Holy Mary too), the worship places of Cross (2 places) and holy spring (Mažučiai Spring 2&nbsp;km away from Alksnėnai village, Vilkaviškis district).
 
The main and most popular places of pilgrimage today are included into the tourist routes.

Motor vehicle transport is one of the forms of travel mode to the most pilgrimage places in Lithuania (individual cars, shuttle or charter buses). Pilgrimage is travelling on foot too, this is popular among youth. Directions of traveling on foot can be divided into 3 large areas: 
[[Image:Sarcophagus of Saint Casimir at Vilnius Cathedral.jpeg|thumb|Sarcophagus of Saint Casimir at Vilnius Cathedral.]]
:'''1 – in Samogitia:''' Samogitian Calvary ''([[Žemaičių Kalvarija]])'', Beržoras;
:'''2 – in Central Lithuania:''' Šiluva, the Hill of Crosses ''(Kryžių kalnas)'', Krekenava (28.60&nbsp;km south-west of Panevėžys), Pažaislis ([[Kaunas]] suburb);
:'''3 – in Dzūkija:''' Gate of Dawn ''(Aušros Vartai)'' in [[Vilnius]], [[Trakai]], Pivašiūnai (23&nbsp;km north-east of Alytus). 
*Pilgrimage by foot from the Hill of Croses to Šiluva is organized by [http://siauliai.lcn.lt/ Šiauliai Diocese] annually in the beginning of September.

===Sport===
Lithuanians are proudest of one thing: Basketball. To them it is not just a sport, but a symbol of freedom. Lithuanians had been oppressed by the Russians for a long time, kept fighting against them and were the first to declare their independence from the Soviet Union. Basketball finalized this process when the newly independent country of Lithuania participated in the World Olympics in Barcelona: they barely managed to raise enough money to send the team to the tournament, but they returned as heroes because they came back with a bronze medal after besting the Russian team for it. This victory was even more meaningful because, in previous Olympic games, Lithuanian athletes had been forced to play for the Soviet Union, winning a gold medal for the Soviets in the 1988 Olympics. Lithuania also has the highest number of NBA players per capita of any country, and is consistently one of the top-ranked countries according to The International Basketball Association (FIBA).

Lithuania is as basketball-mad as the British are with football or New Zealand with rugby.  Lithuania is one of the most successful teams in international competition, winning medals in three out of four Olympic tournaments, (bronze), and finishing fourth in 2008.  Major domestic clubs are [http://www.zalgiris.lt/ BC Žalgiris] from [[Kaunas]] and [http://bc.lrytas.lt/ BC Lietuvos Rytas] from [[Vilnius]].  Basketball is so popular in Lithuania that you are sure to find a basketball court in almost every park and playground.

Be careful if some people challenge you to a basketball game. Common Lithuanians are very good in basketball, and you might just embarrass yourself.

Arvydas Sabonis is a legendary basketball player that earned a spot in Basketballs Hall of Fame.

Artūras Karnišovas is all time leading scorer for Lithuanian national team.

Swimming is also a sport that is gaining a lot of attention, especially after Rūta Meilutytė won olympic gold medal in women's breaststroke.

Žydrūnas Savickas is another person that Lithuanians are proud of. He is considered as the strongest man in the world.

Knowing Lithuanian sports will definitely help you win their hearts.

==Buy==
{{Euro}}
Lithuania adopted the euro on 1 January 2015, replacing the litas.

===Shopping===
Lithuania has a lot of shopping malls for so few inhabitants but there isn't a big difference between Lithuania's shopping malls and those in other parts of Europe.

[[Vilnius]] recently became a shopper's paradise when plenty of massive shopping centres were opened all over the city. [http://www.akropolis.lt/ Akropolis] (a chain of shopping malls in Lithuania) is one of them and definitely worth visiting if you are a shopping malls maniac, as it houses an ice skating rink, bowling lanes and a cinema.

Shopping centre [http://www.helioscity.lt/ Helios City] in Savanorių Avenue offers to have dinner, to take a cup of coffee and to go shopping under the one roof. On the first and the second floors of the Helios City restaurants, cafes, small shops, beauty salon, dry cleaning and other service companies are located. The centre of the city or the Old Town and the new leisure and service centre are separated by less than 1.5km. It is convenient to access the Helios City from any place of the city – either by public or proper  transport.

[http://www.gariunai.lt/ Gariūnai] is the Baltic's largest open air market, located on the western edge of [[Vilnius]]. Thousands of merchants can be found there on a good weekend, from not only Lithuania, but also from as far away as Ukraine. Clothes, shoes, and even music can be bought there. Counterfeit goods still can be found, and it was a serious issue several years ago. But since it's illegal the demand has decreased significantly, and as a consequence profits decreased as well, therefore merchants are not really interested in such trade even without an effort of authorities. Overall, a low price is guaranteed, quality is not.

[[Kaunas]] is also a city of shopping centres, and the centre of the city, ''Laisvės'' avenue is a pedestrian thoroughfare. The main shopping centres in [[Kaunas]] are: Akropolis, [http://www.mega.lt/ Mega], [http://www.molas.lt/ Molas], [http://www.savascentras.lt/ Savas], HyperMaxima, and [http://www.urmas.net/ Urmas shopping area]. There is even that symbol of "mall culture", which is new to Lithuania, ''Akropolis''. Actually, Mega has the biggest aquarium in whole Europe that could be find in a mall. It has more than 800 fishes from every ocean and various seas. It is more than worth seeing.

[[Klaipeda]] is a major shopping centre for people from [[Latvia]] and Kaliningrad. The main shopping centres are: Akropolis, Arena, [http://www.studlendas-klaipeda.lt/ Studlendas] and [http://www.big-klaipeda.lt/ BIG]. Many people coming to the city on cruise ships shop in [[Klaipeda]], due to the good value and price combination.

Amber shops are very popular in Lithuania, which is found in the [[Baltic Sea]]. 

The cost of living in Lithuania is cheaper than Western European Countries, some of the other Baltic Countries have similar prices, with some being even cheaper.

==Eat==
Lithuanian dinners usually include meat, potato, vegetables and sometimes a curd sauce of some sort. Case in point: the ''cepelinai'', or zeppelins, which are meat filled potato-starch based zeppelin-shaped masses traditionally slathered in a sauce of sour cream, butter, and pork cracklings. Pork is traditionally eaten, beef much less so. Needless to say, vegans will have a hard time eating out, although some large restaurant chains will have vegetarian dishes on the menu.

Some fast food in Lithuania, such as Kibinai, (from the Karaim people) small turnovers usually filled with spiced lamb, and Cheburekai (a Russian snack), large folds of dough with a scant filling of meat, cheese, or even apples, can be found around the city. 

Many restaurants have menus in English (usually in the Lithuanian menu) and to a lesser extent, Russian. Though use caution as sometimes menus in other languages may have inflated prices, although this is a rarity, and won't be found in [[Vilnius]], or the better known chains such as Čili Pica (Chili Pizza).

If you are traveling to Lithuanian shore from the eastern part of Lithuania and you are passing through Karmelava you must try Cepelinai. The Restaurant is called Briedžių Medžioklė (address Vilniaus street 54, Karmėlava) and they have the biggest size Cepelinai in the whole country. Usually, 3 or 4 homemade Cepelinai call fill up a big person. To eat 2 Cepelinai at Briedžių Medžioklė is a huge achievement. Usually Lithuanians make the stop at Karmėlava because in their eyes a trip to shore is extremely long and across the country, even though it lasts only a little bit over 2 hours.

==Drink==
Lithuania is a beer drinking country, with the most famous brands being Švyturys, Kalnapilis, Utenos, Horn and Gubernija. A visit to a kiosk will show that there may be more than 50 different brands of beer in this small country.  Alcohol percentages are displayed on the label, and usually range from 4 to 9.5 percent.  Compared to other European countries, beer is usually affordable, in shops starting from 1 € per half litre, in bars approx. 2,5 to 4 € per half litre (beer is sold by the half or full litre, a full litre being found rarely). The beer tastes excellent, putting global brands to shame and it can be said that Lithuanian lager is of at least equal quality to Czech, Slovak, German, and Polish lager. A request for a Lithuanian beer always generates goodwill, even in a Chinese or other foreign-themed restaurant.

When you visit a bar or restaurant without intending to eat, try one of the bar snacks, which are very popular among Lithuanians. The most popular of these snacks consists of a bowl of pieces of garlic bread covered in cheese.

In addition to beer, rather cheap but high quality vodka (or "degtinė" in Lithuanian) is consumed, but not to the extent usually associated with this part of the world. Also, every region has its own home-made speciality of which "Samane" is most famous/notorious and is best avoided. The larger supermarkets have an incredible variety of vodka from all the main vodka-producing countries.

Lithuanian mead, or ''midus'' is a beverage produced exclusively under government control.  It is commonly made from all sorts of Lithuanian flora, from leaves and berries to some tree bark. Alcohol percentages range from 10% to 75% (considered medicinal).

For tourists, quality sparkling wines, such as ''Alita'' or ''Mindaugas'', and local liqueurs are popular choices to bring back home.

Keep in mind the law that came into effect from Jan 2009 that prohibits selling alcohol in shops between 10PM and 8AM (bars, cafes, restaurants etc. are exempt from this).

In shops and cafés different tea and coffee qualities are widely available. The selection in coffee ranges from northern European brands to French ones. In coffee houses, you should expect to pay up to 1.50 € for your coffee. Some cafés offer also a variety of special coffees with more or less special prices. Many cafes (kavinės) still make "lazy" coffee, which is simply coffee grounds and boiling water, unfiltered, with grounds at the bottom of the cup, often surprising the drinker - ask before you buy! Tea is usually sold at 50% of the price of coffee. Some of the wonderful drinks such as the Marganito are great for fun filled party drinks and rated one of the top kinds of wine in the country, perfect for weddings.

Unlike restaurants, or pubs aimed at tourists, bars ''(Baras)'' may be frequented by heavy drinkers and can therefore be somewhat rowdy. Nevertheless a visit may still be very rewarding, especially if you accept an invitation to participate in karaoke.

A law banning smoking in cafés, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, discotheques and other public establishments was passed in May 2006, and came into effect on 1 Jan 2007. However, many nightclubs have internal smoking rooms, which have a degree of ventilation.

Tap water is suitable for drinking in many parts of Lithuania. In other areas, local people prefer to purchase bottled water or to run tap water through water filters. If you need to buy bottled water, a 5 litre bottle is not much more expensive than a one litre bottle. Where in doubt about the tap water, seek local advice. 

Mineral water is also offered in restaurants, cafés and shops, although it's a bit more expensive than tap water. Some popular brands are ''Rasa'', ''Tichė'' and ''Vytautas''.

==Sleep==
There are two main clearly distinguished types of accommodation in Lithuania: “urban style” accommodation and “countryside style” accommodation. Roughly the former type is called ''Viešbutis'' (Hotel), and the latter is called ''Sodyba'' (Homestead). Which one belongs to the actual hotel or hostel, or B&B, or some other standard international category depends on how the owners' marketing policy is aimed at foreign visitors. Domestically it is considered that the actual difference is only in those two types of accommodation and price. For example, the range of “urban” type of accommodation may be called by locals a luxury hotel, budget hotel, a cosy hotel, and a motel – those all versus the “homestead”, which can range from a cosy little farmhouse style hotel to mini-resort. This may be very useful to know if you want to move around without pre-booking accommodation or just in unusual circumstances: you’ll be able to understand locals if they say that “there are no hotels, only one farmstead (homestead) nearby”, and you won’t try to insist that “there must be a B&B, I know that for sure”.

===Hotels, motels, hostels, apartments=== 
There are several international hotel chains in the major Lithuanian cities, and a variety of local hotels. Many hotels and motels are members of [http://www.lvra.lt/ ''Lithuanian Hotel and Restaurant Association''], some hostels are members of [http://www.lha.lt/ ''Lithuanian Hostels Association''].  Hotels, hostels and motels are ranked by stars (1 to 5 stars). The price of accommodation depends very much on the place. For instance, in [http://www.joniskis.lt/ Joniškis] (Northern Lithuania), you can get a good hotel room for about €30 whereas an equivalent room might be as much as €60-90 in [[Vilnius]]. 

Some hotels in [[Neringa]] and [[Palanga]] may be similarly or more expensive as in Vilnius because of highly acclaimed location. In this case the price may seem high and hotel itself overrated, but it all is determined by location. It especially applies to Neringa which is a more expensive place in all respects.

Most hotels do have web home pages, but some do not. Nevertheless, the Internet helps considerably in planning. 

You will find the hotels of every town in their own articles. However, remember that this is a service maintained by the volunteers and you should not wait for current prices let alone that there would be all the possibilities listed.

Most large cities such as Vilnius or [[Kaunas]] have an abundance of hotel options from €15 and up. When travelling to a popular vacation spot in the summer and around the New Year (like Palanga or [[Druskininkai]]) make sure to book a room in advance because demand may outnumber supply. Additionally, some of the cafes on the main highways between cities also have rooms to rent.

Hostels, usually called ''Svečių namai'' (Guest Houses), provide simple, budget accommodation. They may be good places to meet other travellers and wrong places if you expect to deal with locals. 

If you want to rent the apartment, the prices will be usually from €200 a month. In the biggest towns there are companies which rent apartments "to the long-time tourist or worker". In these you complete on good conditions the apartment furnished and cleaned by the cleaner from €300. 

If you are looking for an apartment for a shorter period (from a few days onwards), do a Web search for ''"trumpalaikė butų nuoma"''. This will give you some portals or sites of companies, though not all of them are available in English – some are, however, available in other languages such as German, Polish or Russian. Also you can use option of online translation, it often is sufficient.

===Countryside tourism homesteads===
[[File:Miego Klinika, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|Cottages of [http://www.miegoklinika.lt/ ''"Miego Klinika"'' ("Sleep Clinic")] homestead in ''Kurtuvėnai Regional Park'', Kelmė district]]
Homestead (''Sodyba'', nom., sing. or ''sodybos'', nom., plur.) is a common name of the separate tourism industry branch. One of the key features is that homesteads typically are not related to agriculture, but usually are associated with short-term and long-term recreation places. They are a type of accommodation in the countryside. Homesteads which are members of [http://www.atostogoskaime.lt/en/apie-lkta/about-association ''Lithuanian Countryside Tourism Association''] are ranked by storks (1 to 5 storks). The official website of the Association [http://www.countryside.lt/ Countryside.lt] offers the shining catalogue for accommodation alternatives and you find nearly all the countryside targets and a reservation system from there. 

There are 10 official types of activity; each homestead is focused on one or several of them. Here is a list of all ten types of activity you can choose from their website: Quiet recreation, Culture recreation, Active recreation, Holidays for Families, Culinary Heritage, Environment-friendly Homestead, Wellness Homestead, Family Celebrations, Business events, Agrotourism. 

Currently the association has over 400 homesteads, most of which provide Quiet recreation services (around 200 homesteads). The Family Celebrations are in second place, and the third is the Holidays for Families with children. Culinary heritage homesteads are scattered throughout the regions and offer services related to the traditions of the concrete region.

The popularity of Celebrations service can answer the question where the Lithuanian urban youth go to celebrate: the further from city the better. You have a whole house with all equipment and a territory with ponds and saunas on your own... and everything is surrounded with a large forest. This is a striking difference compared to the Westerners who come to the Baltic cities to get drunk. It may give you an idea why locals sometimes express a very negative attitude to the foreign visitors and insist that they are inappropriately behaving in the inappropriate place. You should know and accept that the forest is an appropriate place in such situations. Homestead that is focusing on Celebrations provides a far more adequate service than some luxury hotel or a restaurant in a city can offer. 

The styles of homestead range from very simple “sleeping with the grandmother" to large mini-resorts. Three homesteads listed below are not only deserving attention, but also distinctly represent three different styles. They all are conveniently situated near the main roads, but at the same time conveniently secluded. The first one is almost in the middle of the country, Samogitia region; the second one is in the centre of the country not far from Kaunas and Via Baltica, Aukštaitija region; and the third one is closer to the capital and situated on the edge of Aukštaitija and Dzūkija regions.

===Camping===
[[Image:Road signs in Lithuania - accommodation.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.7|Road signs: different types of accommodation.]]
There are two kinds of camping in Lithuania: wild camping at the appointed place where you have a right to park your car and set up the tent - and “civilized” camping at the camp site suitable for camper vans.

Most of the latter camp sites are the members of [http://www.camping.lt/ Lithuanian Camp Site Association ''(Lietuvos kempingų asociacija)''], they have at least  the basic facilities of shower/toilet blocks, and often offer a range of useful additional facilities. Camp sites are ranked by stars (1 to 4 stars). Most of camp sites are in recreation areas and very few are near the main roads. There are about 25 camp sites that are members of the association, and several that are not. Lithuanians consider this kind of business not profitable. If there is a need for a camp site it is very common to look for the homestead instead: many homesteads allow to stay with the camper vans or just to set the tent in their territory, some have the parking sites specifically for campers, separately from the car parking lots. All facilities are available, living comforts vary in accordance with the rank (storks) of the homestead. Therefore it is impossible to come across the camp site incidentally just driving down the main road (e.g. Via Baltica) if you don’t know its location beforehand or don’t  look specifically. In this case one should also pay attention to the road signs of homesteads.

Camp sites by the main roads:

The other kind of camp sites, plenty of which are marked on the regional maps with an icon resembling a tent (specified on bilingual legend: ''stovyklavietė'', en. transl. ''campsite'', in contrast to the camp sites suitable for camper vans: ''kempingas'', en. transl. ''camping''), are just a small plots of meadow in the depth of the forests and by the rivers. Some of those icons indicate the presence of homesteads that specialize in countryside tourism industry and offer a certain zone where the canoeists and bicyclists can stay in their tents overnight for the small fee. Typically such sites are surrounded with impassable thickets; scarce wild meadows are either swampy or full of formicaries and unsuitable for rest, the private land is the only salvation. The sites that are in public recreation zones usually are free of charge and have no facilities except some rugged wooden furniture (benches and tables) typical for Lithuania.

==Learn==
Lithuania has one of the best educational systems in the World. Many universities participate in student exchange programs. Most popular international college in Lithuania is [http://www.lcc.lt/ Lithuania Christian College], LCC, in [[Klaipėda]]. The best universities of Lithuania are [http://www.vu.lt/lt/ Vilnius University ''(Vilniaus Universitetas)''], VU, [http://www.vgtu.lt/ Vilnius Gediminas Technical University ''(Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas)''], VGTU, and [http://ktu.lt/ Kaunas University of Technology ''(Kauno Technologijos Universitetas)''], KTU.

In [[Kaunas]], apart the biggest technical university in the country, KTU, there are a [http://www.lsmuni.lt/ Lithuanian University Of Health Science] ''(Lietuvos sveikatos mokslų universitetas)'', [http://www.lkka.lt/ Sports University] ''(Sporto universitetas)'', the [http://lmta.lt/  Academy of Music and Theatre] ''(Muzikos ir teatro akademija)'', [http://www.asu.lt Aleksandras Stulginskis University] (former Agriculture University), and multidisciplinary [http://www.vdu.lt/ University of Vytautas Magnus]. 

[[Klaipėda]] and [[Šiauliai]] also has its own universities. In the country several lower educational institutions which go with the name ''kolegija'' (engl a college) also are found. 

The course supply hangs very much from the university and there also are somewhere programmes for English. However, pay attention to the fact that Lithuania's official language is Lithuanian and in the law it has been prescribed that the Lithuanian student has a right to study in Lithuanian in Lithuania. Especially all the courses of the candidate level will be thus in Lithuanian and in the Master of Arts programmes in English the bulk of the courses is in English. Depending on the rules of the university the courses must have a certain number of foreign students before it must be in English (it touches courses in English) and if this limit is not exceeded, the lecturer may lecture, if desired, in Lithuanian. Because the employment of universities has been lowered last year about 20% and the addition which is paid for the courses in English in some universities to the lecturers was removed, many lecturers choose the easiest road preferably for them to themselves. Then the foreign students can take the course by writing either essays or based on personal meetings. 

The grading system in Lithuania is generally 1-10 in which 5-10 correspond to the accepted performances. The local students usually have to keep their average very high and still a higher one in order to get the scholarship in order to guarantee free studies. There is no financial aid for studies.

==Work==
There are now many work options in Lithuania. Any EU national can work and live freely in Lithuania. For non-EU citizens residence permits must be obtained, and employers must prove a lack of competent workers in Lithuania for such employment, which can be difficult. 

In Lithuania you need the residence permit and a registered address for the working for non-EU citizens. The immigration authorities will usually be fairly fluent in English, otherwise either Russian or Lithuanian is useful. One seldom manages working life without control of the language. 
 
In Lithuania the worker pays 21% of an income tax 6% for health and unemployment insurance which is about 3%. The taxes take about 20% of the salary, irrespective of income. Minimum wage is about 300&nbsp;Euros and average wage is approaching 850&nbsp;Euros.

==Stay safe==
In general you should take basic safety measures:

* Take care when visiting potentially dangerous neighbourhoods at night. After dark it is safer to walk along main roads, than to take a short cut through a park or apartment complex, as these areas often have very poor lighting. Take a taxi if you are nervous. A thing to watch out for is bicycle theft, and it is advisable not to leave valuable things in your car. 

* As with eastern Europe in general, openly gay behaviour such as holding hands or kissing may result in a violent confrontation from an onlooker. Suspicion of homosexuality may also cause problems; two male visitors to a straight nightclub should sit a respectable distance apart, even if they are heterosexual. Overall, if you are a man that prefers other men over females you should not be open about it. Usually, the ones that are proud about it get harassed. On the other hand, lesbians are not typically attacked.

* Members of ethnic minorities, (particularly those of African descent), may experience some form of racism. This is not tolerated by the authorities and racist attacks are rare. However non-whites may at least have to get used to being stared at by locals, especially in rural areas. More often than not this can be out of pure curiosity rather than malice. The issue of race relations, the history of slavery and civil rights are relatively unknown. That said, the presence of several Afro-American basketball players in the Lithuanian league does help and means that racism is perhaps not as big a problem as in other eastern European countries. The best way to overcome any minor issues is to maintain a dignified air and understanding that for many Lithuanians living in a homogeneous society, they may not have had any previous contact with a person of color. Therefore, if you are a dark skinned, do not be surprised that they whisper to each other. You might hear them saying something similar to "nigger". They do not say it because they mean to disrespect you. They do not understand why it is a wrong thing to do, since they hear this word in movies and music in a language which is foreign to them.

* Driving in Lithuania is considered dangerous according to European standards. Lithuania's rapidly expanding economy has lead to an increase in traffic density, thus accident rates are high. As a pedestrian, take great care when crossing the roads, as pedestrian crossings may be ignored by cheeky drivers. When driving be careful of aggressive, quickly going and irresponsible drivers. It's better to pass them even if they are flouting rules. Keep in mind that traffic police could be corrupt. Mind the forest roads, collisions with wildlife animals can easily occur. 

===Natural danger===
* If bitten by a dog or a wild animal, seek medical attention immediately; ''emergency phone number:'' '''112'''.
*In some parts of the country, particularly in pastures, forest outskirts and meadows with a high grass, there is a low risk of contracting tick-borne encephalitis. Vaccination is advised at least 2 weeks before you plan out-door activities in a wild nature. Risky areas (mostly agricultural areas of pastures with some woodland) are annually updated on the [http://www.erke.lt/s/show/6/Erkinio-encefalito-paplitimo-žemėlapiai map of the prevalence of encephalitis-infected ticks]. The risk of Lyme disease is similarly low, vaccination is not available. Prevention: avoid high grass areas and wear long trousers and appropriate shoes.
* The main wild animals that transmit rabies are raccoon dog and red fox. All occurrences of this horrible disease are FATAL, but a prior course of vaccination and proper emergency prophylactic treatment may buy you 12 hours before proper its onset. Plan your activities in the forest accordingly. Oral vaccination of wildlife is regularly carried out since 2006 up to date. According to [http://vmvt.lt/ State Food and Veterinary Service] the number of infected animals has significantly decreased; all infected animals occur in the eastern districts of the country, supposedly from Belarus. State Food and Veterinary Service regularly informs that if rabies vaccine bait is found, leave it alone and do not touch it.
* There is a one species of poisonous snake, the European adder, which has a distinct dark zig-zag on its pale back. Poisonous insects are bees, wasps and bumblebees. The only poisonous plant is Sosnowsky's Hogweed, an invasive plant which appeared in Lithuania in c.&nbsp;1950. Since 1990 it has quickly spread all over the country and in 2001 it was included in the list of malicious animals and plants. The plant is 3–5&nbsp;m in height, the leaves are 50–60&nbsp;cm long and its all parts are extremely toxic; skin contact causes severe chemical burns (up to 3rd degree) and skin necrosis.

==Stay healthy==
[[Image:Pharmacy in Vilnius Old Town.jpeg|thumb|Official logo of Lithuanian pharmacies resembles the Rod of Asclepius shaped like the letter "V", green graphics on a white background. The "V" stands for "Vaistinė", lithuanian for Pharmacy.]]
No inoculations are needed to enter or leave Lithuania. In the winter only influenza can cause you a considerable inconvenience.

==Respect==
[[Image:Baltic Cross.JPG|thumb|Prechristian Baltic Sun and the Moon cross at the top of wooden monument. Christian and pagan traditions are very intertwined in Lithuanian culture]]
[[Image:All Saint's night in Lithuania.jpeg|thumb| All Saint's Day, one of the most significant annual events: time to remember loved ones. Don't be annoyed if bars seem rather deserted this day, remember that you are the guest in this country.]]

Lithuanians are a Baltic nation; however, it's common for tourists to think that they are somehow connected with Russians. 

Lithuanians form their own distinct ethnic group and speak their own language (Lithuanian), which is one of the most archaic Indo-European languages, belonging to the Baltic ('''not''' the Slavic) branch of Indo-European languages.

It is a notoriously difficult language to master, but learning how to greet locals in their own language can go a long way. They will appreciate your efforts in Lithuanian.

Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union from the end of World War II until 1991. You should also try to remember that the Lithuanian capital is [[Vilnius]], not Riga, which is the capital of neighbouring [[Latvia]], a common mistake for travelers and an annoyance to locals.

Because of war time occupations by Tsarist Russia in the 19th century, the Soviet Union in the 20th century and the territorial disputes with Poland in the early 20th century, conversations revolving around disputes with neighboring countries are not a good idea for those not from the region. Be careful when mentioning Lithuania in the context of the former USSR. Any praising of Soviet practices is very unlikely to be understood or appreciated by the Lithuanians. Talking about World War II or the Holocaust is not something to talk about either. This is because this is a very touchy subject to many Lithuanians.

Lithuanians may appear at times nationalistic; however, it is with good reason that they are a proud nation as they have fought to maintain their cultural identity through dark times, and this has kept them a unique and in general a warm and charming race. Although most Lithuanians officially are Catholics, native (pagan) Lithuanian religion is still alive in traditions, ethnoculture, festivals, music etc. 

Lithuanians may appear sad, depressive (suicide rates in Lithuania are among the highest in the world), a little bit rude and suspicious, so talking about your good health, wealth, and happiness could be sometimes taken negatively. Smile at a Lithuanian in the street and most likely they will not respond in kindness. Smiling in Lithuania is traditionally reserved for friends; smile at a stranger and they will either think you're making fun of them and there's something wrong with their clothes or hairdo, or that you must be an idiot. Furthermore, an automatic Western smile is widely regarded as insincere.

Women are traditionally treated with utmost respect. Female travellers should not act surprised or indignant when their Lithuanian male friends pay their bills at restaurants, open every door in front of them, offer their hand to help them climb down that little step or help them carry anything heavier than a handbag - this is not sexual harassment or being condescending to the weaker sex. Male travellers should understand that this is exactly the sort of behavior that most Lithuanian girls and women will expect from them, too.

It is considered somewhat impolite for men to eat or drink with their hat or cap on while sitting at the table. This does not apply if the head must be covered for religious reasons (Judaism, Sikhs, etc.) or eating while walking on the street.

==Contact==
In Lithuania, internal area codes consist of a zero mostly followed by 2 digits for the town, followed by 6 digits for the local subscriber number. Smaller towns have a zero and then 3 digits and the 5 digit local subscriber number. Vilnius has 7 digit numbers and just ''5'' as the city code. The national number's total length is always 8 digits if one excludes the initial zero (as one must, of course, when dialling from abroad).

To call abroad from Lithuania, the international access code is 00
 
International and roaming calls are expensive. To reduce your bill you can:
:* buy "phone cards" for international calls;
:* talk over the Internet.
  
===Land line phones===
There is monopoly operator for land line phones - [https://www.telia.lt/privatiems/ Telia], a subsidiary of Sweden (Telia) and Finland (Sonera). Land line phones are easy to find in all country. Public phone booths are used with cards, which you can find in kiosks, "Telia" or newspaper stands, however this service is left mostly in hospitals, dorms and some other institutions, as well as at the relevant points in the largest cities, for example in Vilnius bus and train stations. So far existing rules does not allow to refuse this service, but Telia, which is responsible for maintenance, will do that in the nearest future at the first opportunity. There is no data of how much and whether at all it is useful for people who come from abroad.  
     
===Mobile phones===
Numbers begin 06nnn, where the three digits "n" indicate the original network provider.
There are three mobile phone operators in Lithuania: [https://www.telia.lt/privatiems Telia], [http://www.bite.lt/ BITĖ Lietuva] and [http://www.tele2.lt/ TELE 2]. About 97% of the country's surface is covered by the standard European GSM 900/1800 MHz network, the remaining 3% are non-walkable forests.

===Internet===  
If you're bringing a laptop, Wireless LAN Hot-Spots are available in distinct places (mostly [https://wifi.telia.lt/ "Telia Wi-Fi"]), sometimes free, otherwise not very cheap. Best chances of finding one are at airports, railway stations, in cafés, shopping malls, universities, various places. You can ask in your hotel, but be prepared to pay. For those who need to connect at an Internet cafes, major cities do have internet cafes. You can get free wireless Internet in [[Kaunas]] main pedestrian street -  Laisvės Alėja. Average internet speed in Lithuania is actually better than American internet speed. Average fixed broadband download speed reaches 70.2 Mb/s, while upload speed is 62.2 Mb/s. Keep in mind that the internet service that provide such speeds are not free.  

With your mobile phone you can use: CSD, HSCSD, GPRS or EDGE, but the cost may be unattractive. UMTS is only available in some bigger cities. If your phone is not SIM-locked, you may consider purchasing a pre-paid SIM card designed for data access. 

If you want to communicate with your friends or locals using internet, you'll need two programs Skype or ICQ. The most popular chatting program is Skype, all of which can be used in English as well. As well in Lithuania social websites are quite popular. Facebook is the most popular; such websites like LiveJournal, Draugas.lt are rather unevenly popular, Myspace exists, but is not widely used, Twitter somehow does not fit.

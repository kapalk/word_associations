'''Cape Verde''' [http://www.anv.cv/] (Portuguese: ''Cabo Verde'', Kriolu: ''Kabu Verdi'') is a country in [[West Africa]]. It comprises a group of [[islands of the Atlantic Ocean]], west of [[Senegal]].  It is part of the region of Islands collectively known as Macaronesia.

Despite its remoteness in elevation with all but 3 islands being mountainous, the lack of natural resources, its isolation from many other countries, and devastating famines in the later 20th century, Cape Verde has won a positive reputation in promoting what is considered the most stable democracy in Africa, a standard of living higher than most African nations, and one of the most politically liberal nations on the continent, and in the world. 

==Understand==
Cape Verde (pop. 506,000) is located 500 km from the west coast of Africa.  The once uninhabited islands were discovered and colonized by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in the 15th century; they subsequently became a trading center for African slaves and later an important coaling and re-supply stop for whaling and transatlantic shipping. Independence was achieved in 1975.

Most Cape Verdeans have both African and Portuguese antecedents. 

===Climate===
Cape Verde’s climate is tropical, with a warm, dry summer. As a part of the greater Sahel region of Africa precipitation is meager and falls between the months of June to February, peaking in September.

Some islands see almost no rain, these are Sal, Boa Vista and Maio; these are arid. The islands with the most rain fall are Santiago, Fogo and Santo Antao, but are nonetheless semi-arid.

===Holidays===
The national holiday is the 5th of July, Independence Day.

==Regions==

Cape Verde is formed by 10 main islands and about 8 islets. The main islands are (clockwise from northwest):

Royal Air Maroc[http://www.royalairmaroc.com/] fly from [[Casablanca]].

===By boat===
There are only infrequent, expensive connections to the mainland.

==Get around==
Timetables in Cape Verde are not to be taken too seriously - don't be too surprised if that boat departs ''ahead'' of schedule . This is important to consider if you decide to do some island-hopping. Due to weather and other conditions flights may be delayed or canceled. Carry your toothbrush with you and build in some buffer time to your planning especially if you need to meet an international connection.

===By plane===
TACV Cabo Verde [http://www.flytacv.com/] airlines has regular flights between the majority of the islands.

*TACV Air Pass [http://www.flytacv.com/promo.html]
*TACV (German Site) [http://www.tacv.de/]
*Cabo Verde Express [http://www.caboverdeexpress.com]

===By boat===
There are ferry services between the islands.  Depending on the distance between the islands you are going from and to, flying can be significantly shorter but also significantly more expensive.

Private Yacht. Cape Verde is a popular transit stop off for yachts that cross the Atlantic Ocean bound for the Caribbean.  In November the ARC+ rally and the Cornell Odessey all arrive at the marina in Mindelo whilst those not part of an organised rally anchor locally.  Requirements for entry of private yachts is relatively easy with immigration and customs offices in Mindelo and Praia.  Special permission is required to visit some islands, obtained from the local Police.

===By taxi===
Nice, new taxis are available in the major cities and are metered.  

''Aluguers'', which are usually either open back pickup trucks with bench seats or 15 passenger Toyota vans, tend to travel between more rural destinations, particularly on Santo Antão. Also called ''hices'' (due to its model, Toyota Hiace), they work as a collective taxi: they drive by the main streets, usually near the city market, and they announce the final destination from the window, gathering passengers. They depart when they are full, which may take some time.

==Talk==

The official language is '''[[Portuguese phrasebook|Portuguese]]''', used in all official publications and announcements as well as in business, media and schools, but the local language is '''Cape Verdean Creole''' (''Kriolu kabuverdianu''), a Portuguese-based creole language with 95% of the words from Portuguese and the rest mainly from West African languages. It is divided into 9 dialects spoken on various parts of the country. Even though Kriolu is comprehensible to a skilled Portuguese-speaker, almost all people can also ''speak'' Portuguese as a second language. French is also known by many, and some people also speak English.

It is a good idea to know some Kriolu or at least Portuguese, since even though young urban people are often quite proficient in English, this does not apply to old and rural people, and even those who can speak English will highly appreciate any attempt you do to speak Kriolu or Portuguese.

==See==

==Do==
* Game fishing
* Kite surfing
* Jetskiing and other water sports
* Canyoning in Santo Antao

===Currency===
The official currency of Cape Verde is the escudo, abbreviated CVE and indicated with a cifrão (a symbol similar to the dollar sign, but with two vertical strokes instead of one) after the amount. The currency is fixed against the euro at 110$ per euro.

In the resort islands of Sal and Boa Vista, euros are commonly accepted, although you might receive change in escudos.

Money can be changed from all major currencies at the international airports at Sal and Praia. Bank branches at larger towns will also change money. Larger towns also have ATMs that will take Visa, MasterCard and Maestro.

High end hotels will accept credit cards. Other hotels will expect cash although many mid-range ones will accept euros at a reasonably exchange rate (slightly worse than the banks). For everything else, expect to pay in escudos.

===Costs===
Since most goods are imported, the cost of living is moderate to high. On the island resorts of Boa Vista and Sal, the cost of living oftentimes can be compared to their Caribbean counterparts. The island of Santiago is reasonably the least expensive.

==Eat==
Cape Verde has fantastic fresh seafood. Tuna is common, as is Wahoo - a white fleshed fish with similar texture.

*'''Lagostada''' – a lobster dish

*'''Cachupa''' - the national dish made with maize and potato. Fish or chicken commonly added for flavor.

*'''Tosta mista''' - common toasted ham and cheese sandwich.

European food is common on all the islands.  Italian is especially popular on Sal.  Vegetarians can ask for omelets or salads.

==Drink==
* '''Beer''': Strela is a Cape Verdean beer, produced by the Sociedade Cabo-verdiana de Cerveja e Refrigerantes (SCCR).
* '''Grogue''', also known as grogu or grogo (derived from English grog), is a Cape Verdean alcoholic beverage, an aguardente made from sugarcane. Its production is fundamentally artisanal.
* '''Ponche''' is a Cape Verdean cocktail which includes grogue, lime and molasses.
* '''Caipirinha''', from the Portuguese caipira for hillbilly, is a cocktail popular throughout the former Portuguese colonies. Made with cachaça (white lightning), sugar and lime. Specifically with cachaça, the alcohol results from the fermentation of sugarcane juice that is afterwards distilled
* You can easily find international beers and other drinks, including some from Portugal.
* Local '''wine''' from Fogo: Ch&atilde; (red, white, rosé), Saudade, Manecom
* '''Bottled water''', most of the islanders drink desalinated water, for those who have a hard time adjusting to this bottled water is available. Please recycle.

== Sleep ==
 
There are plenty of hotels and guest houses throughout the archipelago. Though the largest hotels are based on the islands of Sal (Riu Funana and Garopa hotels--1000 rooms combined), and Boa Vista (Riu Touareg--881 rooms).

In the last decade a number of private villa resorts have been developed across the Islands, most notably on Sal, however with the 2008 property crash now subsiding a number of new private villas, townhouses and apartments in luxury resort communities have come onto the holiday rental market with many of the new resorts now on islands other than Sal.  [http://www.capeverdeprivaterentals.com Cape Verde Private Holiday Rental Villas]

==Learn==
There are 10 universities including institutes in the country. The largest universities are: University of Cape Verde and Jean Piaget University of Cape Verde.

==Work==
The Cape Verdean economy is largely service-based, i.e., most Cape Verdeans work in industries, hospitals, transportation and tourism related activities.

==Stay safe==
Crime rates are relatively low. 

Be careful in lonely areas. Don't showcase jewelry, expensive watches etc.
Mostly you are secure in an attendance of a local guide of your trust.
 
The emergency number is 132.

==Stay healthy==
In the resorts, the tap water is usually desalinated and safe to drink. In other areas, bottled water is cheap and commonly available.

==Respect==
People are mostly polite and friendly. 
Senegaleses immigrants will try to sell you something. If you refuse, they will invent stories about the hardship of their families. It is your decision to buy something, but important to bargain.

==Contact==
The telephone system is effective and improving. There is mobile phone coverage in all cities and most towns. Check with your provider as to the roaming costs.

Consider whether a local SIM-Card is benifical for you because of exorbitant roaming costs.

The country also has Internet service provider. 

You will be friendly helped to prepaire you device for telephone and internet in the telephone shop.

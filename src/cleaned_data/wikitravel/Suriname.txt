[http://www.surinametourism.sr/ '''Suriname'''], formerly the colony of ''Netherlands Guiana'' or ''Dutch Guiana'', is a country in Northern [[South America]]. It has a North Atlantic Ocean coastline in the north and is surrounded by [[French Guiana]] to the east, [[Brazil]] to the south and [[Guyana]] to the west. It is the smallest independent country on the South American continent.  The relatively small population lives mostly along the coast.

===History===

Independence from the Netherlands was granted in 1975. Five years later the civilian government was replaced by a military regime that soon declared a socialist republic. It continued to rule through a succession of nominally civilian administrations until 1987, when internal and international pressure finally forced a democratic election. In 1989, the military overthrew the civilian government, but a democratically-elected government returned to power in 1991.

==Regions==

[http://www.srnieuws.com/ '''Suriname's'''] 10 administrative districts can be grouped into three regions:

==Get in==
If you want to visit Suriname and you are not a citizen of one of the following countries, you have to ensure that your visa papers are in order. If you want to apply for a visa please contact one of the Suriname Consulates listed in Contact.

Citizens of the following countries do not need a visa to enter Suriname:

[[Antigua and Barbuda]],
[[Bahamas]],
[[Barbados]],
[[Belize]],
[[Brazil]],
[[Chile]],
[[Costa Rica]] (for holders of diplomatic and official passports only),
[[Colombia]] (for holders of diplomatic and official passports only),
[[Cuba]] (for holders of diplomatic and official passports only),
[[Dominica]],

Note that in most cases you will receive a single-entrance visa. So you only will be able to enter Suriname one time with that visa. In most cases this is no issue, but it can become an issue if you want to combine your trip to Suriname with a visit to for instance Guyana or French-Guiana. As of december 2010 single entry was 45USD and multiple entry 50USD in Georgetown for EU citizens.

When you arrive in Suriname it is important that you inform the authorities where you are staying. Therefore you must go to the foreigners registration office in the 'Nieuwe Haven' within a week after your arrival. The customs-official will remind you of this.

New rules April 2015. All European Union citizens can get the tourist card on arrival . As of November 2011 citizens of the following countries can obtain a single entry 90 day tourist card for $25USD or €20 (cash) at The Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport, at Schiphol Amsterdam airport (two hours before scheduled flights to Paramaribo) and at embassies of Surinam in Georgetown (Guyana) and Cayenne (French Guyana):
[[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Norway]], [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[United States of America]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Uruguay]], [[Venezuela]]. See The Suriname Embassy in The Hague [http://www.consulaatsuriname.nl/] for more details.


===By plane===

====Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport====
({{IATA|PBM}}, {{ICAO|SMJP}}) Formerly called Zanderij International Airport, it is located 45km south of Paramaribo.

From Amsterdam you can get the daily KLM flight. Surinam Airways [http://www.slm.nl/?EN/1] also offers flights from Amsterdam and various caribbean destinations.

From the United States, airline service is available via Surinam Airways and Caribbean Airlines [http://www.caribbean-airlines.com], with a stopover in Trinidad. Besides the daily connection to the [[Netherlands]], there are weekly direct flights to Suriname from [[Trinidad]], [[Brazil]] ([[Belem]]), and [[Curacao]].

From there you can take the taxi or bus into town.  A taxi (if private one) will cost around 80SRD.  However, prices will vary between drivers.  Make sure to arrange and set a price with the driver '''before''' going anywhere. in June 2014 a taxi from the city to the airport cost 150 SRD (if taken from the street up to 200 SRD). A (tourist) bus service cost 60 SRD or 15€ if you prefer to pay in €. This bus will pick you up at your guesthouse or hotel. The local bus cost 2,15 SRD, but is not reliable if you want to arrive at the airport in time. It leaves from the bus station at Heiligenweg in the center of Paramaribo.

====Zorg-en-Hoop Airfield====
({{IATA|ORG}}, {{ICAO|SMZO}}) A small airfield located further from Paramaribo which is for a few private charter companies and primarily local/domestic flights. The following companies have a few daily flights from/to Ogle Aerodome in [[Georgetown_(Guyana)]]: 


* <listing name="Gum Air" alt="" directions="" address="Doekhieweg 03, Zorg-en-Hoop Airport, Paramaribo, Suriname" phone="+597 433830" email="info@gumair.com" fax="+597 491740" url="http://gumair.com" hours="M-Sa" price=""></listing>

===By train===
There are currently no trains in Suriname, however a plan has been announced to reopen the line between Onverwacht and Paramaribo Central Station. The completion date for phase one is hoped to be 2016 and the intention is for the line to be extended onto Paramaribo Adolf Pengel Airport.

===By car===
Guyana has road access to Suriname. In Guyana, Georgetown inquire in for mini-buses traveling to Suriname. Note that entering Suriname, Nieuw Nickerie by water travel from in Guyana is illegal. Buses leave Georgetown for the Surinamese border daily. Ask for Berbice car park.
In the west(Guyana-Suriname border) there's a regular river ferry between [[Guyana]] and Suriname.

There's a possibility of traveling from French Guiana by car (there a small car ferry between Suriname and French Guiana).
In the east there are small boats and small ferry between Albina (Suriname) and St. Laurent ([[French Guiana]]) The price is usually around SRD 10,-  or €5,- p.p.

===By bus===
For around SRD 30,-  or €10,-  you can take the bus from [[Albina]] (bordering [[French Guiana]]) to Paramaribo.

From [[Georgetown (Guyana)|Georgetown]], [[Guyana]], take minibus #63a to Moleson Creek in eastern Guyana just across the river from Suriname. 

Ferries between the Guyanese and Surinamese sides of the river depart at 9am and 1pm. Minibuses typically depart Georgetown at 4am to arrive in time for the 9am ferry. The cost is approximately $US15 to the border however tickets for the whole trip through to Paramaribo are available for approximately $US30 - $US35. Ask at hotels for the numbers of drivers who will pick passengers up from their residences/hotels in Georgetown between 4:00am - 4:30am. There are also a number of drivers who depart Georgetown to meet the 1pm ferry although these are less common. 

Travelers will need to arrive at the border at least one hour before the scheduled departure to clear customs which is open from 6:30am - 8:00am for the 9am departure and 10:30am - noon for the 1pm departure. A one way fare costs approximately circa $US 10 payable in local currency.  

The actual ferry ride takes about 30 minutes. From there you can get a minibus into Paramaribo. Again the trip takes at least 3 hrs and costs ~US$15.

It is better to change GYD to SRD on the Guyanese side of the border where rates are more competitive. Opportunities to change money on the Surinamese side of the border are seemingly scarce and those desperate to change GYD there must be willing to accept a circa 20% loss in value upon exchange as opposed to circa 10% on the Guyanese side. Money changers typically only deal in GYD and SRD (US dollars or Euros are scarce).

===By boat===
In the east there are small boats and small ferry between Albina (Suriname) and St. Laurent ([[French Guiana]]) The price is usually around SRD 10,-  or €5,- p.p.

In the west there's a regular river ferry between [[Guyana]] and Suriname.  Most minibuses from Georgetown and Paramaribo make sure they arrive in time for catching the 11 AM ferry. However there are ferries during the day (depending on traffic). The return fare is 68 SRD (15€) and valid for a period of 21 days. Most minibuses do not cross the Corantijn river, though this would be possible as the ferry carries private vehicles.

==Get around==
Since not many tourists visit Suriname yet and the inner-land is not within easy reach, the expenses of travel are higher than you might expect. Tourist attractions can be more expensive than in Europe or the United States. It is expected that this will change in future since there is an annual increase visible in foreign tourists, creating the necessity of working on better roads as well as other ways of cheaper transportation. 
The best way to go around in Suriname is by boat or car. There are not that many roads going into the country. At every riverbank you can charter boats at reasonable prices. It is wise to travel with a tour guide.

It is also an option to rent a car, although some rental companies don't allow you to go into the forest with their cars. Always rent a four-wheel drive. Suriname traffic drives at the left side of the road.

Alternatively you can travel by bus. Most places of some significance are linked by a system of minibuses that are privately as well as state owned. The national bus company's [http://www.nvbnvsuriname.com website]. Their reputation is 'cheap and slow'.

===By air===
There are two local airlines providing private connections with the innerland. Bluewing Airlines [http://www.bluewingairlines.com/] and Gumair [http://gumair.com/].

==Talk==

'''[[Dutch phrasebook|Dutch]]''' is the sole official language, and is the language of education, government, business, and the media. Over 60% of the population speaks Dutch as a mother tongue, and most of the rest speak it as a second language. Only in the interior of Suriname is Dutch seldom spoken.

[[Sranan phrasebook | '''Sranang Tongo''']] - an English creole language - is the native language of Creoles and much of the younger population, and is often used as a lingua franca between different ethnic groups. It was suppressed by the Dutch for many years, but it is now the most widely used language in Suriname other than Dutch. It was previously called ''nengre'' or ''negerengels'' (Dutch, "Negro English"). There is very little written material in Sranang Tongo. It is not too hard to learn.

Other languages spoken in Suriname include Sarnami (a dialect of Bhojpuri), Javanese and Chinese (Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese). 

Most locals in Paramaribo speak English to varying degrees of fluency. English usage in rural areas is less common.

==See==
With almost a third of the country being declared '''national reserves''', Suriname's main tourist attraction are its vast natural lands and the diversity of flora and fauna in them. Head to the beaches of [[Galibi ]] and [[Albina]] to witness the impressive breeding process of large '''Leatherback sea turtles''', or book a helicopter ride to one of the more remote beaches to see the same, with fewer people around. Spot river dolphins on the way and see the typical '''mangrove forests''' between the ocean and the rain forests. The Amazon rain forests cover most of the Surinam surface and is home to thousands of birds, reptiles, monkeys and even a handful of jaguars. As tourism develops, guided tours and resorts in the heart of the jungle are popping up and make a comfortable option if you want to spend a few days spotting wildlife or plants, including the rubber tree, spike-footed palms, plenty of orchids and cactusses. Daytrips are an option too. The [[Central Suriname Nature Reserve]] is the most popular of the reserves and is home to the '''Raleigh waterfalls''' and mount '''Voltzberg'''. [[Brownsberg Nature Park]] is home to one of the largest man-made lakes in the world: the '''Brokopondo Reservoir'''. Visit '''Tonka Island''' to see the eco-tourism project that Saramaccaner Maroons have set up there.

'''Maroon and Amerindian villages''' are found deep in the forests, but many of them also lie on the riverbanks. A boat trip down the Marowijne river, with [[French Guyana]] just on the other side, is a great way to see the best of the forest, visit some villages and and do some border hopping on the go. For a less adventurous day, try swimming in [[Cola Creek]], a black water (Blaka Watra) recreational park some 50 km from Paramaribo and popular with Suriname families. On the way back, make sure to stop at the [[Jodensavanne]] (Jews savanna), where the Jews were allowed to settle in the 17th century. Now, only the ruins at this important historic place remind of those days.

'''[[Paramaribo]]''' itself is a pleasant place and its historic inner center is a Unesco World Heritage sight. The capital has many characteristics of a large village community and although there are few real landmarks and sights, is a nice place to spend some time. Linger on the '''Waterkant''', the water side street with its old wooden, colonial houses and grab a bite from one of the food stands there. Go shopping at the Central Market and gaze at the Jules Wijdenboschbrug. Stroll to '''Fort Zeelandia''', through the Palm tree garden and the Independence square. Make sure to include the Roman Catholic '''Saint Peter and Paul Cathedral''' in your walk, since it is the largest wooden building in South America.

'''Former plantations''' will take you back to colonial times, when coffee and sugar where produced here. Some of the plantation houses have been renovated, and a few are even in use to make coffee and dry shrimp. Bike through the quiet and green area, between the banana plants, to visit former plantations with names like Einde Rust (''End of Rest''), Worsteling Jacobs (''Struggle Jacobs''), Zorgvliet and Zeldenrust (''Rarely Rest''). Peperpot (''Pepper pot'') not far from Paramaribo on the other side of the Wijdenbosch bridge even has a 3,5 km trail with signs and explanations about what you see (entry 18 SRD).

==Do==
You will much enjoy the entertainment there like music and watching Association Football.  Surinamese songs are called "pokoes" in Sranang Tongo. They have a great variety of music, because of the different cultures.

=== Central Suriname Nature Reserve ===

The Central Suriname Nature Reserve (CSNR) protects some of the most remote, ancient, and pristine wilderness on Earth. It comprises more than 1.6 million hectares of primary tropical forest. The Reserve forms a corridor linking the three most important protected areas in central Suriname: the Raleighvallen Nature reserve in the north, and the Tafelberg and Eilerts de Hann Gebergte Nature Reserves in the central and southern portion of the corridor. The area —an area the size of New Jersey—  protects the watershed of one of Suriname's most important river systems, the Coppename River, where there are countless varieties of flora and fauna, many of them endemic. The Raleighvallen Nature Reserve is one of the most important protected areas in South America. Vegetation there consists mostly of moist highland forest, the same forest that covers approximately 80 percent of Suriname. The Tafelberg Nature Reserve is in a remote area that includes the geographic center of suriname. This area is made up of primary rainforest and savanna ecosystems. The Eilerts de Hann Gebergte Nature Reserve has no human populations living within or around its boundaries. This reserve includes parts of the Eilerts de Hann Gebergte mountain range and is made up of primary tropical rain forest and savanna ecosystems. Since there has been very little exploration in this Reserve, very little is known about is flora and fauna. The Central Suriname Nature Reserve is an important precendent in protecting large blocks of undisturbed tropical wilderness. But it is only a first step. The challenge for Conservation International and its funding partners is to continue these efforts to protect the ecological viability of the world's last remaining tropical wilderness areas. Conservation International has been active in Suriname since 1991, using an integrated approach that draws on both the knowledge and expertise of highly trained Surinamese conservationists as well as CI's on-the-ground experience in twenty-two other countries of the world. 

Rather than sell the country's forests to the highest-bidding timber companies, the Surinamese government made a commitment in 1998 to protect the forests and explore the long-term economic benefits of sustainable development and ecotourism. Conservation International (CI) joined Suriname to help design, fund, and promote this effort to carefully blend biodiversity conservation and economic opportunity.

Seven years later, the uniquely constructed tourist facilities on Foengoe Island—tucked neatly within the CSNR—are poised to become a premier destination for ecotourism in the Guayana Shield, the massive, two billion-year-old geological formation that underlies five countries in northeastern South America.

=== Raleighvallen Nature Reserve ===

This nature reserve has an area of 78,170 ha and is situated along the Coppename River. It can be reached by airplane (less than an hour) or by car (120 mi) to be followed by a 3-4 hour boat ride. The reserve headquarters and the tourist lodges are located on Fungo Island in the middle of the Coppename River.

Raleighvallen (Raleigh Falls) is the name for the extensive set of rapids near Fungo Island in the upper Coppename River.

The reserve is internationally known as a bird and monkey paradise. You'll see toucans, macaws and parrots and 400 other species. Hanging from the tree branches on and around Fungo Island you'll notice the pendulum-shaped nests of the weaver birds (oropendulas) which are large, colonial nesting birds with yellow outer feathers. These nests can be close to a meter long.

Another interesting feature is the Voltzberg. This granite sugarloaf mountain can be reached on foot in about three hours by jungle trail from Foengoe Island. The Voltzberg rises about 150 m (375 ft) above the forest canopy. The night can be spent in a hammock in a simple jungle camp at the base of the mountain. During the night you will be surrounded by the sounds of monkeys, tree frogs, and other creatures from the tropical rainforest.

The reserve is also the home of the spectacular and rare cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola rupicola).

There is the possibility, as well, of encountering deer, tortoises, tinamous, and several species of monkey on the 7 km (one-way) hike to the mountain. The trail is good but the damp climate of the rainforest, and the steep climb up the Volzberg, make it a heavy trip, especially for the out-of-shape hiker.

=== Brownsberg ===

This park is situated 130 km (90 mi) south of Paramaribo, and can easily be reached by car. The park headquarters and tourist bungalow/lodges are situated on the cool, 500 m (1500 ft) high Mazaroni Plateau. At several places on the plateau there is a beautiful view over the Brokopondo Reservoir. And trails lead to creeks, waterfalls and lookouts, giving spectacular panoramic views of the interior. Except for the park staff, there is no permanent habitation in the park itself. The Brownsberg is known for its rich flora and fauna. The Brownsberg is also a paradise for birdwatchers. Of the 650 birds known for Suriname, more than 200 can be found here. Some of the birds are rarely seen because they live in the forest canopy, although their songs and whistling are heard regularly. Irenevallen is a waterfall of about 10 m high in the Brownskreek. It is about an hour's walk from park headquarters. After a heavy rain it is wonderful to stand under this natural shower. Witikreek is a secluded rushing stream at the foot of the Brownsberg. You can walk to it in about a two-hour downhill hike. Once there you can swim, nap in a hammock, and have a picnic.


=== Galibi Nature Reserve ===

Galibi Nature Reserve  is world famous as a nesting site for endangered sea turtles. Four species come ashore to lay their eggs between February and August. The nearby Amerindian villages of Christiannkondre and Langemankondre can also be visited, giving you an opportunity to purchase Carib indian artwork. This is a wonderful place to relax for a few days. Here are undisturbed sea turtle nesting beaches, where you have the best chance to observe different species of turtles: the green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas), the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), and the olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea). Eilanti Beach is the only beach where mass nesting aggregations (arribadas) of the olive ridley are known to have occurred in the Atlantic region. The hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) nests only sporadically in Suriname with rarely more than twenty-five nests per year for all of Suriname.

The Galibi Nature Reserve is situated in the Northeast corner of Suriname, at the mouth of the Marowijne River, bordering French Guiana. Because the saline oceanic Guiana Current and the freshwater flow of the Marowijne River collide along the east and north borders of the reserve, it is exposed to many different environmental factors. This results in a great biological diversity characterized by the Suriname coast.

The Galibi reserve and the nearby Amerinidan villages are accessible only by boat, about 1 1/2 hours downstream from the drop in point, Albina. The villagers are allowed to use the reserve for fishing, hunting, plant collecting and small-scale agricultural activities.

=== Upper Surinam river ===

This is the most easily accessible way to go far inland. The road south from Paramaribo branches off just before Brownsberg to the south of the Brokopondo Lake. This branch is as of 2010 still under the process of being surfaced. It ends at Atjoni, where the Upper Surinam river begins and where many boats can be found around noon to take you upstream. These regular boats go as far south as Djuumu, where the river branches into Gran Rio and Pikin Rio. In between, the river is littered with guesthouses, way too many of them, so there is plenty of choice and there is generally no need to book ahead.
Minibuses for Atjoni leave Paramaribo from Saramakka street early moring between 6 and 7 A.M for a 4 hour bumpy ride over unpaved jungle road (bauxiet road).

The culture here is quite different from the coast and misunderstandings are to be expected. For example, a surgarge on the agreed price is often added upon leaving for use of the kitchen. So make sure beforehand if this is the case. And since that can be a relatively high surcharge (eg 10 srd on top of 40 srd for the room), it might be advisible to bring your own cooker. Also, an improptu forest walk with the owner can later turn out to cost 100 srd. On the other hand, if you go paddling in a dugout you are not likely to be charged for that (although it never hurts to ask). And one traveller wasn't even charged anything when during such a trip he ran the boat onto a rock, resulting in a total-loss.

=== Nature Resort Kabalebo ===

Kabalebo Nature Resort lies in the unspoiled west of Suriname. This area is completely uninhabited, allowing one to rightfully speak of "untouched nature".  
Within a circumference of hundreds of kilometers, you will see nothing except for the flora and fauna of the splendid Amazon rain forest. Where playful monkeys leap through the treetops, the colorful parrots glide above your head and unusual fish leap and quickly swim away down a secluded creek...

Besides the numerous unusual birds, colorful butterflies and many dazzling types of fish, you may also come across a member of the cat family, the jaguar. You may spend hours on exploratory trips together with your guide. But you may also see many animals even if you decide to remain in the vicinity of the lodge.

=== Other locations ===
* [[Awarradam]]
* [[Palumeu]]
* [[Kasikasima]]
* [[Nickerie / Bigi Pan]]
* [[Colakreek]]
* [[Matapica]]
* [[Blanche Marie Falls]]
* [[Berg en Dal River Resort]]
* [[Danta Bai]]
* [[Nature Resort Kabalebo]]

==Buy==
Suriname uses the '''Suriname dollar''' (SRD) as currency, which is roughly a third of a US dollar. One can exchange currency at all banks as well as most cambio's. Automatic teller machines (ATM) are also available in Suriname. The atm's of the RBTT bank accept most international bank cards.
Accommodation and food is relatively on the cheap side. Retail prices for clothing, gifts, etc. are similar to most of United States of America. 

Things which are well worth buying are:
* Handcrafted jewelery
* Tropical flowers
* Perfumes

==Eat==
Because of the ethnic diversity there is a variety of exotic food available.
Indian (specially roti with chicken), Chinese, Javanese (Indonesian), Creole.

=== Javanese ===

Although Indonesian food might be appropriate, the Indonesian people we have in Suriname are mostly if not all from the island Java. And Java has its own cuisine  distinct from the rest of Indonesian food. Furthermore as you might have guessed the food has evolved to a more Surinamese culture and is thus (very) different from food you'd find in Java. Nevertheless it tastes great and you should try it. The most popular places where you would find such food is in ''''warung's'''' Lelydorp on your way from the airport to [[Paramaribo]], or Blauwgrond in Paramaribo, and since recently near the bridge in [[Commewijne]].

=== Chinese ===

Chinese food tastes great everywhere in the world. Suriname is no exception. Good restaurants can be found in [[Paramaribo]]
Also try visiting the Chinese market on Sunday and many of their Dim Sum restaurants

=== East-Indian ===

East Indian food is less spicy compared to original Indian food, but still a well appreciated meal.

=== Other ===

International menu are available in the more expensive downtown restaurant and hotels in [[Paramaribo]].

==Drink==

Suriname wouldn't be the tropical paradise it is without its a wide variety of great '''fruit juices'''. Even the well known orange juice is a sensational taste, but do not hesitate to try great tropical fruits like passion fruit (known locally as 'markoesa') or  soursap, better known as Guanábana (locally known as 'zuurzak'). Since locals have an appetite for sweet, sugar is added to most juices you buy in bottles. For pure juice it is best to ask for fresh made juice. 

The Javanese have a pink (and occasionally green) colored drink called '''dawet''', which consists of coconut milk.

Try to get a local 'east-indian' to make you a glass of lassi if you have the chance.

=== Alcohol ===

Beer: Try the local ''''Parbo-beer'''', which when comes in 1 liter bottles is called a ''''djogo''''. In 2008 Suriname finally got Parbo beer in a can, which was somewhat of a major event in the country. Guinness is a popular import beer, and for that reason Parbo also brews a very decent own stout variant: Parbo Stout. Of course imported beer is also available.
Rum: Borgoe and Black Cat.

==Sleep==

There are several good [[hostels]] and guest-houses available in [[Paramaribo]] and [[Nickerie]]. See the appropriate page for more information. When going into the rainforest it is best to buy a hammock in Paramaribo. Some guest houses in the forest provide hammocks, but these tend to be less hygenic, since washing machines are not available in the forest.

==Learn==
The University of Suriname
Universiteit van Suriname [http://www.uvs.edu/]

However, it should be noted that students wishes to pursue education here must have a working knowledge of Dutch as classes are only instructed in Dutch.

==Work==

Working as a foreigner in Suriname without a work permit is illegal, though granted, there is not much of a force to stop you.  However, relations do exist between the Netherlands and Suriname for work exchange programs and extra labour, especially those of skilled classes.

==Stay safe==
If you are concerned about safety try to avoid venturing at night alone.  Try using a bike when possible.  When in Paramaribo at night, avoid the Palm Garden as this is a well known crime site where much drug trade is done.  The police force is only so large and can only protect you to a certain extent.  Therefore, stay where you know police protection is offered. So please, use common sense when venturing outside downtown, which in itself can have problems.  Do NOT venture to the bush (binnenland) alone.

==Stay healthy==

To enter Suriname there’s no need for any special kind of vaccination, though some are recommended (see below).
If you plan a jungle-trip, which is highly recommended, it is possible that you may want to take precautions against malaria, depending on the area you are planning to visit. There were 729 confirmed cases of malaria in 2013 according to the WHO World Malaria Report.
Be sure to check with BOG, or your local pharmacist or health clinic what prophylaxe you should take. The bigger threat nowadays comes from dengue, also spread by mosquitos, for which there is no prophylaxe, nor any cure. Travelers diarrhea can also potentially be a problem.

Yellow fever vaccination is recommended. (Required to get into Brazil afterwards!)
Tetanus-diphtheria vaccination is recommended.
Hepatitis A vaccination is recommended.

The Adult HIV/AIDS prevalence is reaching '''2%''' or 1 in 50 adults, which is 3 times higher than the US and 9 times higher than the Netherlands. Be sure to practice safe sex.

==Respect==
Be respectful when taking photographs. Like everywhere else, one should respect the environment and the culture. For example the inland-people consider certain trees and spots holy and it is likely you need consent before taking a photograph. Your local guide will usually also indicate so. Ask for consent when you think it is appropriate as you would anywhere else.

[http://www.dominica.dm '''Dominica'''] is a [[Caribbean|Caribbean island]] country between the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, about one-half of the way from [[Puerto Rico]] to [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It is often known as '''"The Nature Island of the Caribbean"''' due to its spectacular, lush, and varied flora and fauna, which are protected by an extensive natural park system.  The most mountainous island of the Lesser Antilles, its volcanic peaks are cones of lava craters and include Boiling Lake, the second-largest thermally active lake in the world.
''Should not be confused with the [[Caribbean|Caribbean nation]] of the [[Dominican Republic]].''

==Understand==
It has rugged mountains of volcanic origin rising to the highest point of ''Morne Diablotin'' at 1,447m

===Climate===
Tropical; moderated by northeast trade winds; heavy rainfall.  Flash floods are a constant threat; destructive hurricanes can be expected during the late summer months. Great for long walks on the beach.

===History===
Dominica was the last of the Caribbean islands to be colonised by Europeans, due chiefly to the fierce resistance of the native Caribs. France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia Charles, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.

==Regions== 
[[Image:Dominica Map.png|thumb|upright=1.7|Map of Dominica]]
Dominica is too small for Wikitravel to need to divide it up into separate regions, but it is administratively divided into the 10 parishes of Saint Andrew, Saint David, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Joseph, Saint Luke, Saint Mark, Saint Patrick, Saint Paul and Saint Peter.

==Cities== 
*[[Roseau]] — capital
*[[Portsmouth (Dominica)|Portsmouth]] — the second largest city in Dominica.  Ross University, a large American medical school is situated nearby.
*[[Scott's Head]] — beautiful village at the end of the road on the southwest corner. Scott's Head wraps around the lip of a gently curved bay that happens to be the ancient crater of a volcano. Luckily for divers you can bring your own snorkel or scuba gear and walk out and admire what remains, a 160m deep coral lined hole that stretches for hundreds of metres.  Several quaint shacks serve decent fare for decent prices.  Villagers are curious as visitors are few.  The main road ends at a small point on a  hill that provides stunning views of both Scott's Head below and Roseau to the north. 

*[[Calibishie]] — Stretching from the rugged mountains of Pennville, through the picturesque fishing village of Calibishie to the crashing surf of the Marigot beaches, the Calibishie Coast is one of the few areas in the world where you can travel from the seashore to the littoral forest to the rain forest in little more than a mile. Experience palm-fringed beaches, freshwater rivers with secluded bathing pools, tumbling waterfalls and the soft wonder of the rain forest with its exotic birds and lush vegetation, all in a days' walk.


==Other destinations==
*[[Melville Hall]] 

*'''Toucari Bay''' [http://www.toucaribay.com/] — Toucari is a small fishing village located on the northwest coast of Dominica. The calm caribbean bay boasts some of the best snorkeling and dive sites in the country. A sunken wreck off the bay is said to be a World War I German vessel, which is popular with divers. The “Trou Quarre” was the French name for the sandy cove north of Douglas Bay, but today it is written as Toucari. It is the site of the establishment of the first Roman Catholic chapel in the north of Dominica by French missionaries early in the 18th century. In an advisory to British sailors it was noted as the first bay of shelter for ships sailing from the north or east of the island.

*'''Waitukubuli National Trail''' [http://www.waitukubulitrail.com/] — A 115-mile (184km) hiking trail from the southern tip of the island (in the town of Scots Head) to the Cabrits National Park (near Portsmouth) in the northwest.  Generally well-marked in yellow and blue, it includes sections that overlap roads, as well as well-marked wilderness trails.  It is divided into 14 segments of varying (but generally moderate) difficulty, most of them estimated at about 6 hours to complete.  Much of the terrain is lush rainforest and/or steep mountain trails, but some parts are on roadways. It goes through the Carib territory.  It is conceived as being walked from south to north -- the markings are sometimes a little less intuitive if you're going the other way (ie starting at a segment boundary and walking backwards).  

*[[Morne Trois Pitons National Park]] — A [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], it contains many attractions such as the Boiling Lake, the Freshwater Lake, Boeri Lake and Middleham Falls. Boiling Lake is a 12 mile round trip hike (8 hours), very steep mostly on steps and switchbacks.  A guide is recommended for inexperienced back country hikers, the terrain is rough especially when wet (which it almost always is).  The trail is well marked most of the way.  The trail is indistinct in the Valley of Desolation but picks up again where vegetation begins. The hike is stunning and the bare volcanic mountain tops make for unforgettable views of rolling mountain tops and steamy volcanic vents.  Trail ends at the Boiling Lake, a 100 metre wide lake that is being heated by a volcanic vent and is boiling.

*'''Champagne''' —  A snorkelling spot on the southern coast, underwater volcanic vents emit continuous streams of bubbles making the place feel like a giant glass of champagne. The fish and coral are slightly below average. 

*'''Glassy''' — An incredible and short 2-3 hour day hike in the southeast of the island.  The trail begins nicely enough through some farm land and then plunges into a deep jungle valley then approaches the coast skirting steep cliffs to one side (not for those with vertigo). The trail ends on an old volcanic flow that juts into the ocean, waves roll all around crashing on all sides, little ponds collect some of the water from the crashing waves and some coral and fish make the ponds their home.  When approaching the edges of the cliffs be aware waves have been known to throw people against the rocks or worse yet pulled them into the ocean to their certain death.
[[Image:Dominica boiling lake.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|250px|The Boiling Lake.]]

*'''Jaco Steps''' —  Ford the creek in Belles and hike into the a rain forest up the side of a nearly inaccessible forest plateau. In 30 minutes you will reach the Jaco Steps.  These steps were constructed by escaped slaves (maroons) under the leadership of the African-born Jaco many decades ago.  Their inaccessibility protected Jaco's maroon camp from the authorities for 40 years. To do a circular route by following the river upstream will add a hour at least to your journey and will involve multiple crossings of the river en route.

*'''Central Region''' —  The lushly forested and hand-farmed central region is sparsely populated and considered by many to be the most beautiful region.  It consists of several villages:
:*'''Belles''' 
:*'''Penrice'''
:*'''Dleau Gommier'''
:*'''Wet Area'''
:*'''Stone Hill'''
:*'''Jacco Estate''' Currently a rain forest with a few small farms, previously a coffee plantation and prior to that, the headquarters of the Maroons.

==Get in== 

'''All''' foreign nationals, except those from the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[Haiti]], may enter Dominica visa-free for a stay of up to 21 days or more. Travellers should check with Dominica immigration before travelling.

===By plane===
There are two airports in Dominica, '''Douglas-Charles''' (formerly known as Melville Hall) ({{IATA|DOM}}) and '''Canefield''' (DCF). Most commercial flights land at Douglas-Charles. However, the airport is not able to accommodate jet aircraft.  Night Landing has been approved starting at the beginning of October 2010; however, many airlines have not yet adjusted their itineraries to accommodate the added landing hours.  The island can be accessed through [[San Juan]],  [[Antigua]], [[Barbados]], [[St. Maarten]], [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] and other Caribbean hubs.  

===By boat===
From Martinique and Guadeloupe ferries on most days of the week. Arrival in Roseau. [http://www.express-des-iles.com/index.cfm?lng=en]

Cruise ships increasingly visit.  A large pier serves many directly in front of the downtown area.  If already occupied, ships dock at the industrial port about 1.5 miles away.

==Get around==
As far as freedom of movement and exploration a car can be invaluable.  Though small the island's tightly turning mountain roads make for relatively long journeys and a hair-raising experience.  Driving is on the left hand side of the road and there are various car rental agencies at both airports.

*Honk horn on hairpin turns especially during the day.
*Beware of large lorries as their width forces other drivers off the road.
*Watch for large pot holes and crumbling asphalt as roads can be in very poor condition.
*Ask directions if lost, the locals are very friendly and informative.
*When in mountains in torrential rains, consider stopping for a bit or at least going very slowly.
*A compact is sufficient for most situations but a small 4x4 might also be nice.  A large 4x4 would be cumbersome on the small streets.

Other travel options include buses. If you are on a low budget and have plenty of time then the bus will be fine (except on Sundays, or weekdays after the early evening, when the only bus running goes between Portsmouth and Roseau), although sitting in a bumpy bus for long trips on winding mountain roads is not the most comfortable thing to do. However, these buses are generally safe and timely; the local drivers know the roads well and are used to all the usual weather conditions. Buses are owned and operated privately and therefore do not have to adhere to any timetables and come and go whenever they are filled to the driver's satisfaction– ask around for approximate departure and arrival times, but know that they vary day to day. Most villages have three to ten buses (Portsmouth is the primary exception– it has dozens, possibly hundreds, of buses that perpetually shuttle passengers to and from Roseau) that go to Roseau (or Portsmouth, if they are from a village in the far north– ask the driver, though most of the buses that are advertised as terminating in Portsmouth actually will go all the way down to Roseau, operating as service from Portsmouth to Roseau) in the morning to drop off students or employees, and return in the afternoon with these same people returning home. In Roseau, all villages have designated bus stops that may or may not be marked by a large, red sign. Whether they are marked or not, all shopkeepers and pedestrians you are likely to encounter know the exact location of the stop for your destination. In stark contrast, in the villages, where there is only one bus route (to and from Roseau, or Portsmouth), buses leave from the owner's garage and tend to drive aimlessly around town until the drivers have collected enough money from bus fares to make the trip profitable. However, when they drive around town, they oftentimes circle back to a shelter, awning, or public area that the locals refer to as "the bus stop." Occasionally, they'll just remain stationary there. 

If they are not full (they usually are), buses will pick people up anywhere along their route, so long as they can feasibly pull over and let them onboard. Generally, there are shelters along the routes, either in towns that the bus passes through or at major intersections, where hitchhikers gather. If this shelter is along a bus route, you may get lucky and a bus with an empty seat will stop for you. Be prepared for some competition in claiming this seat. Likewise, buses stop anywhere within reason along their route. Though the hitchhiking shelters are preferred, asking the driver to stop will usually net an opportunity to get out whether there is a shelter there or not. 

When taking the bus, remember:

*Keep an eye on your belongings. Dominica is highly safe and crime is minimal, but there are pickpockets everywhere.
*Don't overpay. The only thing about these buses that are regulated by the government are the fares. Ask the other passengers what they paid; upon seeing a foreigner, the operator may try to squeeze some extra money from you.
*Ask the locals about the bus. Buses from every village operate somewhat differently in terms of trip duration, departure and arrival times, pickup points, and the location of their stop in Roseau. 
*Be prepared. Taking the bus is quite the experience; you will oftentimes be packed in like a sardine, and those that don't like to be touched (which is inevitable on a Dominican bus) or are claustrophobic should consider hiring a car. 
*Don't complain about the music on the radio, the close quarters, or any uncomfortable seating arrangements you find yourself in. Not only will the driver take personal offense to this (it's ''his'' personal car), but he usually won't do anything about what you say. Plus, the other passengers tend to laugh at you. 
*Know a real bus from a fraud. All licensed taxi and bus operators drive vehicles have license plates that start with the letter H. 
*Get on early. Before they go, buses will wait (either at their designated spot in Roseau, or somewhere in town when leaving from another town) to fill up. The best seats are usually the first to go, so grab them before somebody else does. 
*Talk! Foreigners don't tend to take the bus, so your fellow passengers will inevitably be curious. Don't force conversation, but answer questions politely and follow them up with questions or comments of your own. 

Taxi is more comfortable than the buses and may not be expensive, particularly if the fare is shared with 2+ travelers. Whether you use the bus or taxi, make sure that you clearly agree to the destination and price before you start the trip.

==Get out==
Visitors departing through the airport are required to pay a departure tax. As of early 2015 the departure tax is EC$59 or US$23 per person and cash is the only accepted form of payment. Note that if you do not have the exact amount any change given will be in EC dollars, regardless of which currency you used to pay the departure tax. 

==Talk== 
Nearly all Dominicans (including the totality of people you are likely to encounter– taxi and minibus drivers, shopkeepers, restaurant and hotel personnel, and government employees) speak serviceable English with a heavy Caribbean accent. It is understandable, though many travelers for whom English is a non-native language may have a difficult time navigating the native articulation. However, North American and British people generally have little to no problem understanding the local dialect. The native accent is less noticeable among the educated persons of Dominica, such as government employees and tourism industry personnel. The most widely spoken language, though somewhat frowned upon by the government and schools, is a creole of French origin. This creole is the primary language of Dominica and is the language of choice for interactions between natives. French, given Dominica's location between the French territories [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Martinique]], is taught in schools and is a vital trade language for Dominicans. However, due to varying degrees of fluency, French is generally not considered a viable option outside of hotels and major cities such as [[Roseau]] and Portsmouth. Although the island is reasonably close to [[Venezuela]], [[Puerto Rico]], and [[Cuba]], little to no Spanish is spoken on the island, though imported South American products do often bear Spanish text.

All those who are proficient in English should have no issues in Dominica. French speakers should expect to have to speak a little English or attempt to decipher the local creole, which is mostly French in its origin.

==See==
The capital of [[Roseau]] has many restaurants, small shops and wonderful views of the mountains (to the east) and the Caribbean Sea (to the west). The town hums with the sounds of vehicles, Caribbean accents, and minor commerce (e.g. pavement BBQs, vendors selling clothing in street stalls).

An old British Fort is located on the north-west coast at Portsmouth. A small fee may be charged. Expect to spend 1-2 hours at the site.

Scotts Head is a small isthmus on the southern tip of the island. It is also the name of the small community located there. It takes about one hour to drive from Roseau each way. Scotts Head is a great place to hike up the steep outcrop, which offers a wonderful view of the south-west coast of Dominica and the Caribbean Sea (and even the island of Martinique to the south).

==Do==
Snorkelling is particularly good at Champagne, south of [[Roseau]], and at [[Scott's Head]]. Scuba Diving, waterskiing, jet skiing, kayaking or other water sports are also possibilities.  Note that kayaking or canoeing provide an alternative to the ocean and lets you experience the rivers and inland bodies of water throughout Dominica. 

Whale watching, dolphin watching, or boat tours can be arranged from [[Roseau]].

Dominica's waters are also home to three species of marine turtles (Leatherback, Hawksbill, and Green turtle), and these gentle giants can be seen coming in to nest on shore during the months of April to October. Protected viewing sites are set up throughout the island, such as at Mangrove Bay on the Woodford Hill beach in the north east, or on the beaches of Portsmouth in the north west.

Hiking trip, biking, ATV tours, or zip lining are popular in forest areas.  Hiking is one of the best ways to see Dominica and there are many wonderful hikes around the island of easy to challenging.

* <do name="Middleham Falls" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">The waterfall is a wonderful reward at the end of this moderately difficult hike. Be careful on the trail as it can be a bit challenging in parts. The start of the trail is a fair distance north-east of Roseau so expect to spend about an hour driving each way. The hike may take about an hour each way. You'll want to spend at least 30 minutes enjoying your reward for the hike at the Middle Ham falls and pool.</do>

* <do name="Valley of Desolation/ Boiling Lake" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="" email="" fax="">Make sure to leave yourself time to travel to/ from this destination in addition to the lengthy/ challenging hike. Expect to take a at least 8 hours round trip (including driving) - but it's worth the effort. Stunning scenery.
Hire a guide. Not because the path isn't easy to follow (if you're a hiker, it's not that hard), but because small rivers become big torrents when raining... scary to cross.</do>

*<do name="Syndicate National Trail" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">A 30-45 min walk to see easily the parrots, in a beautiful tropical rainforest. 2h walking on a farm road before getting to the trail if you do not have a car, but hitch hiking works quite well with farmers.</do>

*<do name="Trafalgar falls" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">After a very short walk, you can see two big falls in the same point of view. But it is (very) difficult to reach to the bottom of the falls for a swim. However, you can bathe in natural pools of hot sulfured waters, just next to cold rivers ! So much better than artifical pools in Soufrière.
You need a pass to access this site (5 US$).</do>

*<do name="Waitukubuli National Trail" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" url="http://www.waitukubulitrail.com/" hours="" price="" lat="" long="">Crossing Dominica, from the south to the north, this trail is well indicated everywhere. You can do some short easy walks, as well as harder hiking, to the Morne Diablotin for example. 
Around 15 days for the entire trail.</do>

* <do name="Screw's Spa" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="http://screwsspa.com/Screws_Sulfur_Spa/Welcome.html" hours="" price="$10 US for 1 hour for non-Dominicans">Delightful hot spring spa with pools of several temperatures for your soaking pleasure.  A lunch counter is available, as well as higher-priced wraps and rubs, etc.  This is popular with the locals, as well.  In the village of Wotton Waven, outside Roseau</do>

* <do name="Sari Sari Falls" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">Located on the east side of Dominica in La Plaine. The hike to this tall (125 ft.) rainforest waterfall takes 45-60 minutes one way. The route is not terribly long, but it does involve multiple river crossings which can be very slippery. Some wading is required to get to the pool at the bottom of the picturesque falls. Most visitors go for a swim in the pool but be prepared for very chilly water!</do>

* <do name="Victoria Falls" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="" email="" fax="" url="" hours="" price="">One of two waterfalls on the east side of Dominica (the other being Sari Sari Falls), the parking area and trailhead are well-signed thanks in part to the Victoria Falls Tavern. It takes approximately 45 minutes to hike to the falls. The terrain is relatively flat, but you do crisscross the White River several times. The relatively temperate pools at the base of the 165 ft falls are a popular place to take a swim.</do>

Dominica rock climbing and canyoning is an encouraging and motivating experience.  It tests strength and agility while experiencing some of the most breathtaking views of Dominica. 

Dominica is known for their many island events and festivals. The Caribbean Islands love food, music, and celebration. Whether it’s a cultural gathering or a music festival Dominica offers it.

Many of Dominica’s resorts offer spa vacation services on the premise for a convenient way to get rejuvenated for the next day of activities.

* <do name="The Kalinago Barana Autê" alt="" address="" directions="" phone="1 767 445 7979" email="kbamanager@cwdom.dm" fax="" url="" hours="opened daily from 9AM to 5PM" price="Entrance fees are US$10 per person for a 30-45 minute guided tour">This site shares history and traditions of the Kalinago people (caribs) from hundreds of years ago. It is located along the banks of the Crayfish-River near the Isukulati Falls in the Carib Territory of Dominica. The site consists of a reception center, snack bar and gift shops. To begin your tour, a footbridge crosses the river and gives way to a circular trail leading to a series of small huts throughout the village. There is a Karbet which is used for cultural and theatrical performances. Kalinago (carib) traditional activities at the village include canoe building, cassava processing, basket weaving and herb collection and preparation. The kalinagos (caribs) are the indigenous people of Dominica.</do>

==Buy==
[[File:Roseau Dominica Street.JPG|thumb|250px|A craft vendor in Roseau]]
The best local handicrafts are '''Carib made baskets'''.  The earth tone colours come from burying the fibres in the ground for different lengths of time.  All visitors need to ensure that the materials from which they are made allow them to be taken back home.

Dominica is also '''well known for its music''', so be sure to buy some local music while you are on the island.  Genres range from jazz, reggae-dancehall, calypso & soca, to '''Cadence-lypso''' and '''Bouyon''' and  which are popular Dominican genres. Visit during the last weekend in October and be treated to the World Creole Music Festival [http://www.worldcreolemusicfestival.dm] or if you can't make it, ask for the best local artistes, and be aware of pirated copies!

Many kiosks and vendors line the shore at the main cruise ship dock.  One excellent leather store faces the dock on the other side of the road.  Just a short block inland lies a packed, open-air market with perhaps the island's best selection of souvenirs.

Look out for cacao sticks to make cocoa tea as a nice souvenir to take back home.

==Eat==

==Drink==
[[File:Kubuli Beer.JPG|thumb|250px|Kubuli Beer]]
Freshly squeezed grapefruit is ubiquitous and is perfect with every meal. Coconut water is cheap and readily available by the side of the road. Another local speciality is sorrel. This red refreshing drink is brewed from the flowers of an hibiscus specie common also in Jamaica. The popular locally brewed beer is Kubuli.  Ask your hotel to set up a tour of the brewery.

There are many vendors of fruit juice in Roseau.  Almost without exception this is non-pasturised fruit juice with water and sugar added.  The added water is usually chlorinated tap water.
A juice vendor known as Pal sells his juice by the area where one can find a bus to Portsmouth.  Pal is one of the most enthusiastic and knowledgeable fruit vendors on the island.  He sometimes has juice from rare fruits.

Quenchi is a local soft drink which comes in many different flavours. It can be found in every village (with diet varieties at the IGA in Roseau).

Sorrel, known as the Christmas drink for its red colour (and because it only flowers around Christmas) is made from boiled flowers. It tastes heavenly.

Avocado pear juice can be purchased in some small cafes and is certainly worth a try. Other flavours include soursop, passionfruit, grapefruit, orange, lime, beetroot.

The coffee is usually not very good, as most locals seem to prefer tea and juice, with the occasional exception. There are also a few coffee shops around the major towns.

Take usual precautions when travelling around Dominica. Although rare, petty crimes are most likely to happen around Roseau. Elsewhere the island is [http://www.traveldominica.net/dangers-and-annoyances/ extremely safe]. 

Swimming in the Atlantic Ocean is not generally recommended because of strong currents. Popular Atlantic beaches are generally safe enough for cautious swimming, but random strips of sand on the Atlantic side are generally subject to extreme undertoes and big waves. As a rule of thumb, swim where the locals swim!

Swimming in rivers is pretty safe. There are no creatures in the rivers that will cause you serious harm, but, as always, there are pests such as leeches. Flash floods, while uncommon, do happen. If you notice the water change color, this may be because of dislodged sediment and thus could be an indicator of an imminent flash flood.

==Stay healthy==
Tap water is safe to drink, but since it is sometimes drawn straight from Dominica's many rivers, it has a tendency to turn brown after heavy rainfall.  It's better to drink the bottled water available almost anywhere.

Basic healthcare is available at '''Princess Margaret Hospital''' in Roseau.

North Americans moving to Dominica often experience boils for the first time and fingernail and toenail fungi.  Stomach problems are rare among travellers.

Towns are sprayed with insecticides periodically to control the mosquitoes responsible for spreading Dengue fever.  However, the spraying may not be done at the scheduled time and pesticides may drift into your home if the windows are open.

==Respect==
In the high lands and uninhabited central regions water is gathered at roadside springs. Sometimes the bus will stop and passengers will fill their water bottles. Locals prefer the taste of this water to bottled water.

Public water is bacterially safe to drink due to heavy chlorination and has the expected chlorine flavour.

LGBT travellers should be aware that "buggery" (a term used for homosexual sex on the island) is illegal in Dominica, as indicated by the 2012 arrest of two male Americans who were seen having mutually consensual sex on the balcony of their cruise ship while it was docked. The two men did not serve jail time, but paid a USD900 fine.

==Contact== 
Area code is 767 and is part of the North American Numbering Plan.

[http://www.digicelgroup.com/group/ Digicel] is a local cellular company which provides prepaid plans for those visiting for short periods. Cable & Wireless and Orange also provide cell service.

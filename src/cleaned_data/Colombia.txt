[http://www.colombia.travel/en/ '''Colombia'''] - Twice the size of [[France]], and with a diversity of landscapes and cultures that would be hard to find even in countries five times its size, Colombia should by all rights be one of the world's top travel destinations.

Pick a climate, and it's yours—if you find the light jacket weather of Bogotá cold, drive an hour down through the mountains and sunbathe next to the pool of your rented hacienda. If you don't want to sit still, head off into the Amazon or any of the country's other many inland jungles, snow-capped volcanoes, rocky deserts, endless plains, lush valleys, coffee plantations, alpine lakes, deserted beaches. 

For culture, intellectual '''[[Bogotá]]''' might lead the rest of Latin America in experimental theater, indie-rock, and just sheer volume of bookstores, but you could also get a completely alien education in an Amazonian ''malocca'', or you could delve into the huge Latin music scene of salsa and cumbia, with the most exciting dance display being the enormous Carnival of '''[[Barranquilla]]'''. 

For history, wander the narrow streets of [[South America]]'s original capital in Bogotá, check out old Spanish colonial provincial retreats like '''[[Villa de Leyva]]''', trek through the thick jungle-covered mountains of the northeast to the '''[[Ciudad Perdida|Lost City]]''' of the Tayrona Indians. Walk the walls of '''[[Cartagena (Colombia)|Cartagena]]''''s achingly beautiful old city, looking over the fortified ramparts upon which the colonial history of South America pivoted. 

For nightlife, hot '''[[Cali]]''' is today's world capital of salsa, claiming that competitive distinction even over Colombia's other vibrant big city party scenes, which keep the music going long into the small hours of the morning. 

For dining, you'll find everything from the ubiquitous cheap, delicious Colombian home-style meals to world-class upscale and modern culinary arts in the big cities, with cuisines from all corners of the world represented. 

And for relaxing, there are gorgeous tropical beaches along Colombia's [[Costa Norte (Colombia)|Caribbean]] and [[Pacifica (Colombia)|Pacific]] coasts, but you can find even more laidback and peaceful retreats on the idyllic and unspoilt Caribbean island of '''[[Providencia]]'''. 

The political violence has subsided substantially throughout the majority of the country and savvy travelers have already flocked here from around the world—come before everyone else catches on!

==Understand==
Colombia is the only country in [[South America]] with coastlines on both the North Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea as well as the country with the world's second most biodiversity. Lying to the south of  [[Panama]], Colombia controls the land access between [[Central America|Central]] and South America.  With Panama to the north, Colombia is surrounded by [[Venezuela]] to the east, [[Brazil]] to the southeast, and [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] to the south west. The country was named in honor of Christopher Columbus, following the Italian version of his name (Cristoforo Colombo). Although Columbus never actually set foot on the current Colombian territory, in his fourth voyage he visited Panama, which ''was'' part of Colombia until 1903.

Each day tourism grows, traveling in Colombia is definitely worthwhile.  Colombia has diferents kinds of ecosystems, so you can choose the places to visit depending on which "season" you want to stay. From '''Bogotá''' at 2640 m.a.s.l, with an average temperature of 14 degrees Celsius with a temperate climate, to '''Sierra nevada del cocuy''' an ice cap at 5380  m.a.s.l. Just a drive of one or two hours North, South, East or West can take you to landscapes which are as diverse as they are beautiful. To historic city centres and towns, modern and energetic party cities, oriental plains which stretch out far beyond the horizon with little modulation. rugged contours of the higher Andean region, the Guajira peninsula and its desert, idylic beaches, the tropical jungle of the Amazon and the Choco with abundant flora and fauna, snowy peaks and volcanoes, ancient ruins, the Magdalena River valley and its hot weather, beautiful coral reefs and an abundant underwater marine life together with pleasant relaxed tropical islands, and the ability to rest and relax in a privately rented ''hacienda'' that lets you have and enjoy these treasures to yourself. Such a diversity comes in with an equal diverse amount of traditions and foods. 

===Climate===
Take your pick, really. Colombia is an equatorial country with amazing variance in altitude, so it's going to be pretty whatever temperature you like best all year long somewhere! The climate is tropical along the coast, eastern plains, and Amazon; cold in the highlands with periodic droughts. Lacking the usual seasons, Colombians normally refer to rainy seasons as winter—but the differences in terrain and altitude mean the rainy seasons are different in every corner of the country! 

The one downside to all this climactic diversity, though, is that you'll have to bring a fair amount of different clothes if you plan to travel extensively. Cities in the center like Bogotá and those to the north in '''[[Boyacá]]''' can potentially reach temperatures below 0° Celsius, so bring a coat. Some mountains are also covered in snow year-long. Cities along the Caribbean coast like '''[[Cartagena (Colombia)|Cartagena]]''', '''[[Barranquilla]]''', and Santa Marta are hot and humid, while some cities at mid-altitude in the Andes like '''[[Medellín]]''' (the City of Eternal Spring), '''[[Manizales]]''', and other cities in the Coffee Triangle region have beautiful temperate weather always.

===Terrain===
Flat coastal lowlands, central highlands, high Andes Mountains, eastern lowland plains

[[Image:San Felix surroundings.JPG|thumb|Countryside in the Andes]]
'''Natural hazards''': highlands subject to volcanic eruptions; occasional earthquakes. Recent volcanic disaster occurred in Armero, 1985. 25,000 people were buried by lahars that the Nevado del Ruiz produced.

''Highest point'': Pico Cristobal Colon 5,775&nbsp;m (18,950&nbsp;ft) of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, curiously not part of the Andes. The mountain is part of the world's highest coastal range. Nearby Pico Simon Bolivar has the same elevation.

===History===
Colombia was originally inhabited by numerous, major indigenous cultures like the '''Muisca''', the '''Tayrona''' and the '''Quimbaya'''; some groups of indigenous people as the Caribs lived in a state of permanent war, but others had less bellicose attitudes. The area that now is Colombia was conquered by the Spanish through alliances with some indigenous groups when America was invaded by Europeans. The process of conquest and colonization radically altered the social structures of the areas, the indigenous populations shrank dramatically in size and their share of the population has declined ever since. The Spanish Empire brought European settlers, while most of the population in the colony was of mixed Spanish and Indigenous ancestry. In the 16th century, Europeans began to bring slaves from Africa. The Spanish empire didn't engage in the slave trade directly, the Spanish empire relied on the asiento system, awarding merchants (mostly from other countries) the license to trade enslaved people to their colonies and the majority of these traders were Portuguese, French, English and Dutch.

Colombian independence from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 the "Gran Colombia" Federation was dissolved. It was one of the five countries liberated by Simón Bolívar (the others being Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia). The success of the Independence movements across Latin America was made easier by the Napoleonic Wars that left mainland Spain with two rivaling governments. What is now Colombia and Panama emerged as the Republic of New Granada. The new nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858), and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. The United States of America's intentions to control the Panama Canal led to Panama becoming a separate nation in 1903.

Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America. Slavery was abolished in the country in 1851. The years following independence were marked by several civil wars, the legacy of these conflicts combined with state repression against leftist militias in rural areas and world polarization caused by the Cold War culminated in a communist insurgent campaign in 1964 by the FARC and the ELN to overthrow the Colombian Government. The years during the conflict were marked by heavy fighting between the communist guerrillas, the Colombian state and military, right-wing paramilitaries and several drug cartels. In the years following 2005 the safety has been improving throughout the country. As part of a difficult peace process the AUC (right-wing paramilitaries) as a formal organization had ceased to function, and in 2012 the government and the FARC started peace talks aiming at bringing the 50 year old Civil War to an end once and for all. Colombia is currently in a process of recovery with an rapidly improving economy. Ending the conflict, wealth inequality and rebuilding the nation are some of the issues that confront the country. In October 2016, President Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in bringing the country's five decades of civil war to an end. Now Colombia is becoming a '''tourist hotspot''', each month arrives several amounts of tourist, and is becoming safer, actually is safer than some places in United states.

==Get in==

===By plane===
There are regular international flights into major cities including [[Bogotá]], [[Medellín]], [[Cali]], [[Barranquilla]], [[Bucaramanga]], [[Cartagena]], [[Pereira]], [[Cúcuta]], [[Armenia]] and San Andres Island as well as to other smaller cities in the borders with Venezuela, Ecuador, Panamá and Brazil.

There are daily direct flights to and from the U.S, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Venezuela, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.

Beware that [[Medellín]] is the only Colombian city served by 2 airports: International and long-range domestic flights go to ''José María Córdova'' International Airport ({{IATA|MDE}}) while regional and some other domestic flights arrive in ''Olaya Herrera'' airport ({{IATA|EOH}})  [http://www.aeropuertoolayaherrera.gov.co/ppal.php].

Bogota has two airport terminals: Puente Aereo and El Dorado. Outside the airport, be aware of enterprising men who will help you lift your bags into a taxi or car, and then expect payment. It is best to politely refuse all offers of help unless from a taxi driver you are about to hire.

Taxis are regulated, reasonably priced and safe from the airports. A taxi ride from the airport to the central business district in Bogota, takes approximately 20 minutes.

===By car===

* Enter from [[Venezuela]] by the [[San Cristobal]]-[[Cúcuta]] or [[Maracaibo]]-[[Maicao]] pass.

* Enter from [[Ecuador]] by the [[Tulcan]]-[[Ipiales]] (Rumichaca) pass. Or through [[Lago Agrio]] - [[Mocoa]]

* Since Colombia is surrounded by 5 countries one imagines road travel from/to neighboring countries is easy: far from reality. There are no major roads coming from Panamá, Brazil and Perú. There are no roads at all from Panamá (yes, North and South America are not connected by roads), and there are tiny roads between Colombia and Perú or Brazil, but they do not lead to major cities or regions.

===By bus===

====From Venezuela====

Connections can be made from the Caracas main terminal to most cities in Colombia. From the main terminal, Maracaibo (Venezuela) you can find buses that run to the cities (Cartagena, Baranquilla, Santa Marta) on the coast. The border at Maicao provides a relatively easy, straightforward entry into Colombia from Venezuela.

You can also enter from Venezuela via the busy [[San Cristóbal (Venezuela)|San Cristóbal]] to [[Cúcuta]] route, which passes through the border town of San Antonio del Táchira.

====From Ecuador====
It is very straightforward to enter Colombia from Ecuador. Travel to Tulcan, where you can get a taxi to the border.  Get your exit stamps from the immigration offices and take another taxi to Ipiales.  From there you can travel further to Pasto, [[Cali]], [[Pereira]], Bogotá.

From [[Lago Agrio]] to [[Mocoa]], check the [[Mocoa]] page.

====From Panama====
You can't cross from Panama to Colombia by bus—the Darien Gap begins at Yaviza, where the Interamericana runs out. Consider using the boat crossing instead.  There are often yachts that will shuttle you between Colombia and Panama and offer a stop in the gorgeous San Blas islands.
Airlines with flights between the two countries are: Avianca, COPA, VivaAir, AirPanama and Wingo.

Several bus sites serve the region. Fronteras also called ContinentalBus or Bolivariano [http://fronteras.com.co]. BusBud [https://www.busbud.com/], PinBus [https://pinbus.com].

===By boat===
Enter from [[Panama]] by the [[Puerto Obaldia]]-[[Capurganá]] pass. From [[Capurganá]], another boat ride takes you to [[Turbo]], where buses take you to Medellín and Montería.

If you enter from [[Brazil]], there are weekly boats from [[Manaus]] to [[Tabatinga]]/[[Leticia]] through the Amazon River. It takes around six days to go from Manaus and just three days to come back (the reason of the difference is the current of the river). There are also weekly motorboats which are more expensive, but cover the route in less than two days.
Once in Leticia you have daily domestic flights to several cities, including [[Bogotá]].

From Santa Rosa [[Peru]] (an island in the middle of the Amazon river), across from Leticia, you can take a fast (10hr, US$ 75 or 200 PEN) or slow (2-3 days, ~US$20-25, bring a hammock, plate and spoon - food is provided) boat to Iquitos in Perú.

The link in the lower pacific neighboring Ecuador is too rough for regular passenger boats.

===Visas===
Citizens of most western countries, including most [[Europe]]an countries, all [[South America]]n nations, [[Panama]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[Mexico]], the [[United States of America|United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Indonesia]], [[Brunei]], [[Philippines]], [[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], [[Bhutan]], [[Japan]], [[Russia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Singapore]] don't need a visa, unless they are staying for more than 90 days. Irish citizens no longer need to apply for a visa. Canadian citizens are now required to pay a reciprocity fee of COP 171,000 at arrival, except for those staying in San Andrés Island and Santa Catalina, as well as those arriving via charter flight into Cartagena.[http://www.migracioncolombia.gov.co/index.php/prensa/comunicados/comunicados-2014/diciembre-2013/1473-pago-por-reciprocidad-canadienses?highlight=WyJyZWNpcHJvY2lkYWQiXQ==]

Colombian authorities will stamp passports from the above countries giving permission to stay for a maximum of 30 to 90 days. Immigration officials at any of the international airports of the country will usually ask you the intended length of your trip, giving you a determinate number of days that will cover it, which you can extend to 90 by going to any immigration services office. 

====Extending your stay====
You can apply for a 90-day extension to your stay at an Asuntos Migratorios office in some of the major cities, which costs around 40.00 USD. You need two copies of your passport's main page, two copies of the page with the entrance stamp, two copies of a ticket en route out of the country, and four photographs. The procedure takes some time and includes taking your fingerprints. For visitors, the maximum length of stay can not exceed 6 months in 1 year.

==Get around==

===By plane===
The most important domestic carriers in Colombia are :
* '''[http://www.avianca.com Avianca]''' (main airline in Colombia)
* '''[https://www.latam.com/es_co/ LATAM Colombia]''' (formerly Aires)
* '''[http://www.easyfly.com.co  EasyFly]''' (Regional prop planes)
* '''[http://www.satena.gov.co/ Satena (Servicio Aéreo a Territorios Nacionales)]''' (Operated by the Colombian Air Force to provide transport to remote regions of Los Llanos, Amazonas & the Pacific coast from Bogota, Cali and Villavicencio)
* '''[https://www.vivaair.com/co  VivaAir]''' (Former VivaColombia, a low-cost, Ryanair-like airline).
* '''[http://www.ada-aero.com  ADA (Aerolinea De Antioquia)]''' (new Medellin based carrier offering regional flights in Antioquia and adjoing regions)
* '''[http://www.aexpa.com.co  AEXPA]''' (Primarily a charter carrier to and along the Pacific coast.)

Air travel is popular inside Colombia, most cities look not far from each other in the map but the curvy roads in the Andes make for long trips. A typical 35-min flight from Bogotá to Medellín can take more than 8 hours by car. There are around 40 non-stop flights a day in that route making it one of the most travelled in the Americas.
The airlines have well-kept fleets and regular service to major towns and cities in Colombia. The major Colombian airports have been certified as "Highly Safe" by international organizations. 

Please be aware that the online payment process of some domestic airlines is complicated: For example Easyfly does not accept international credit cards. Payments can be done at the airport or official ticket offices. Also, when you are in Colombia, for most airlines you can make a reservation online and get a 'code' so you can pay within the next 24 hours at a bill payment office (Usually Effecty, ServiEntrega. Similar to Western Union).

===By train===
There is no passenger train service in the country.

===By car===
Driving is on the right hand side of the road-most cars have standard transmissions. Colombia's fleet is composed mainly of cars with 4-Cylinder engines that are of European, American and Asian brands.
Foreign visitors may drive if they show an international driver's license (a multilingual endorsement card issued by automobile and driver's clubs around the world).

Insurance is cheap and mandatory.

The speed limit in residential areas is 30&nbsp;km/h (19&nbsp;mph), and in urban areas it is 60&nbsp;km/h (37&nbsp;mph). There is a national speed limit of 80&nbsp;km/h (50&nbsp;mph) with a few portions of 100 km/h (only when marked accordingly).

The country has a well-maintained network of roads that connect all major cities in the Andean areas, as well as the ones in the Caribbean Coast. 
There may be significant landslides on roads and highways during the rainy season (November to February), by which traffic gets interrupted. This usually is resolved within 6 hours to 4 days.
There are many toll crossings; the fee is between COP 8,000 and 12,000.
There are also plenty of dirt roads of variable quality.
International land travel is only possible to Ecuador and Venezuela.

===By bus===
Travel by bus is widespread and has different levels of quality. Long-distance trips rarely cost over COP 150,000 or US$50 (one way). When acquiring tickets for the bus, the local custom is that the passenger comes to the terminal and buys the next available bus going to the desired destination. Depending on the company or terminal, it may be even not possible to purchase a ticket 1 or several days in advance! Therefore, it is recommendable to know at least when a particular service starts and ends in a day. Long distance bus travel tends to be very slow because main highways are two-lane roads with lots of truck traffic. For any distance more than 5 hours, you may want to check into air travel. For low-cost fares [https://www.vivaair.com/co VivaAir] is the best option.

Other companies that goes to the south part of the country: [http://www.bolivariano.com.co/ Bolivariano], [http://www.expresopalmira.com.co/ Expresopalmira], [http://www.coomotor.com.co/ Coomotor].

Online tickets are now available at most of these websites.

===By urban bus===
Around the turn of this century urban centers in Colombia saw the development of a highly efficient and neat bus transit systems that are spreading to other countries. In Bogotá you can find the '''Transmilenio''', in Medellin el '''Metroplus''' [http://www.metroplus.gov.co], in Cali el '''Mio''', in Barranquilla '''Transmetro''', in Bucaramanga '''Metrolínea''', in Pereira the '''Megabús'''.
It is still recommended that you keep an eye on your belongings and that you do not carry valuables, excess cash (more than $20,000 COP visible) or unnecessary items. Never accept food or drinks from strangers. Avoid talking to strangers at bus stops or terminals. It is possible you may be stopped at police check points. A calm attitude is the best key to avoid inconveniences.

===By metro===
The only metro system of Colombia is in [[Medellín]], in the Department (state) of Antioquia. It connects the outlying suburban towns with the barrios of Medellín - Line A departs from La Estrella to Barrio Niquía, Line B from Barrio San Antonio to Barrio San Javíer. The metro system also has one electric streetcar and four cable car lines, a unique experience as passengers travel up the mountains in gondolas. One of the cables rides up to Parque Arvi (costs an additional COP 6,000), and after a 20-minute trip in the gondola carts you reach an altitude of 2,500 meters above sea level. [https://www.metrodemedellin.gov.co/en]

===By taxi===
The taxi networks in big cities such as Bogota are extensive and very cheap. A (bright yellow) taxi journey across Bogota, can take up to a day but cost less than US$15.

If you order a taxi by phone the company will then give you the taxi registration number. Then the taxi will be waiting at the given address. You may need to give them a three or four digit code given to you when you book the taxi. During the day some taxi ranks outside hotels, office buildings and government offices will only allow certified drivers and companies and will also take your name and details when you board the taxi. Taxis from city to city are easy to arrange by phoning ahead and agreeing the price, it will still be cheap by western standards and is safe and quite agreeable.

The meter in all taxis starts at 25, and then increases over distance. The number it arrives at corresponds to a tariff that will be on display on the front seat of the cab. Taxi and bus prices increase on Sundays, public holidays, early in the morning and late at night. There are also extra charges for baggage and for booking in advance by telephone.

Unlike many other countries it is not customary to tip the taxi driver.   It's up to the individual.

Many taxis are not allowed to travel outside of Bogota due to boundary restrictions with their licences.  You should always make arrangements to travel outside of Bogota by taxi ahead of time.

In some locations (Las Aguas in the Candelaria district of Bogota for example) you may find an individual acting as a tout for taxi drivers - they will offer you a taxi and lead you to a particular cab. They then recevie a small tip from the driver.

Taxis (and much else besides) are much more expensive in Cartagena than in other cities.

Uber is another alternative, relatively cheap in comparison to taxis and generally available in Bogota and Medellin. Be advised, Uber is illegal in Colombia so the drivers are hesitant of meeting at the Airport layby or popular spaces with Police near and may opt for you to meet them in a more discreet location.

===By cable car===
Since most of the Colombian population lives in the Andes, '''cable car systems''' are becoming popular for both commuting and tourist transportation.  You can ride the 5 different cable lines in Medellín or the ones in Manizales, Cali and beginning 2019 at the south of Bogotá; meanwhile one in Pereira is under construction. The ones in Medellín are integrated in the Metro system [http://www.medellininfo.com/metro/metrocable.html], in the other cities to the bus systems.

There are several cables in rural small towns of [[Antioquia]]: [[Jardín]], Jericó, Sopetrán and San Andrés de Cuerquia. Also enjoy the magnificent view of the new cable car above the Chicamocha river canyon in [[Santander|Santander (Colombia)]].

==Talk==
The official language of Colombia is '''[[Spanish]]'''. 

Besides the standard Spanish, 68 ethnic regional languages and dialects are recognised. English also official in the San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina Islands. Some indigenous tribes in rural areas continue to speak their own languages, though almost all people from those tribes will be bilingual in their indigenous language and Spanish.

If you've recently learned Spanish, its a relief to know that the Bogota dialect is clear and easy to understand. The Spanish does vary, however, from Cartagena to Bogota to Cali. Generally the Spanish on the coasts is spoken more rapidly, and Spanish from Medellin has its own idiosyncrasies. Note that in cities like Medellín and Cali, the dialect of Spanish is the ''voseo'' form. Meaning that instead of the second person familiar pronoun ''tú'', ''vos'' is used instead. Though ''tú'' is also understood by everybody, ''vos'' is a more friendly voice while ''tú'' is reserved for intimate circles. The Spanish spoken along the Caribbean coast is similar to the dialects spoken in spoken in [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Dominican Republic]].

English is taught in school, and Colombians are often exposed to subtitled Hollywood films, so while shy, many younger Colombians in the largest cities know at least a few basic phrases in English. Expect to meet teenage Colombians who may want to practice their English skills with you.

Some Colombians from more affluent backgrounds will have lived and worked in the U.S., Canada, England and possibly Australia in order to learn English. Many university text books are in English, and the majority of high ranking professionals, executives and government workers in Colombia speak an acceptable level of English.

French, German and Portuguese are also spoken, but to a lesser extent.

==See==
Much of Colombia is in the Andes, which means there is very nice mountainous scenery to be found. On the other hand, there are also nice beaches to be found in the lowlands. The altitude of some peaks mean that snow can be seen even though they lie in the tropics.

==Do==
There are a lot of things to do in Colombia, and you can find parties and celebrations wherever you go. Colombians especially love to dance, and if you don't know how, they'll happily teach you. Colombia is known for its exciting night life.

There are many groups and agencies offering eco-tourism and it is very usual to find trekking  plans (locally named 'caminatas' or 'excursiones')  on weekend; many groups (named 'caminantes') offers cheaper one day excursion, special trips (on long weekends or during periods of vacation time (January, Holy Week, July, August, October, December)  to different places in the country. Some recommended groups based out of [[Bogotá]] are: Viajar y Vivir, Fundación Sal Si Puedes, Caminantes del Retorno; there are many other.  Patianchos in Medellín; Rastros in Bucaramanga. If you are into adventure there's an archaeological site of an ancient city in Colombia's Sierra Nevada called Teyuna, it's a lost city created by the Arhuaco, the Kouguis and the Wiwas. It was found in 1972, when a group of local treasure looters found a series of stone steps rising up the mountainside and followed them to an abandoned city.  They usually offer guidance and transportation to the place; on long trips, include lodging and other services. The recommendation is asking if the guide has the official certification.

==Buy==
The Colombian textile industry is well-recognized and reputable around South America and Europe. Clothing, including lingerie is particularly well-regarded as high quality and very affordable. Leather garments, shoes and accessories are also of interest to foreigners.  The best place to buy either is [[Medellin]], known for being the fashion capital of the country, where one can buy very high quality goods at a very low cost.

Colombian emeralds and gold (18k) jewelry can also be very attractive for visitors. A typical Colombian style of jewelry is a copy of precolombian jewelry, which is fabricated with gold, silver and semi-precious stones.

The "mochila", the Spanish word for "backpack" or "rucksack", is also a traditional, indigenous, hand-woven Colombian bag, normally worn over the shoulder. They are commonly sold in shopping malls, especially in the Santa Marta/El Rodadero area. Mochilas usually come in three sizes - a large one to carry bigger things, a medium one to carry personal belongings, and a small one to carry coca leaves. Coca leaves are carried by local tribe members to reduce hunger, increase energy and to combat altitude sickness.

Handicrafts such as intricately designed jewelery are commonly sold in markets and on street corners. Many street vendors will approach people, selling t-shirts, shorts, glasses, bracelets, watches, necklaces, souvenirs, and novelty photographs. If you want to buy something, this is a good time to exercise your bartering skills. Usually you can go down by 2,000 to 3,000 pesos, however 10%-15% is the generally accepted rule. For example, if someone is selling a shirt for P$10,000, try asking if you can pay P$8,000. Go from there.

If you don't want to buy anything, a simple ''gracias,'' ("thank you") and a non-committal wave of your hand will deter would-be sellers.

===Money===
The currency of Colombia is the ''Colombian peso'', often symbolised locally as "$", but in our guides the ISO international symbolisation of '''COP''' is used.  Most banks and money changers will exchange major world currencies such as the US dollar and the euro. The ubiquitous Giros y Finanzas (also does Western Union transfers) [https://www.girosyfinanzas.com] can be found in many shopping malls. It is interesting to note that currency exchange are traded below the market value meaning you can get for example dollars below market rate.

===Costs===
*For transport, accommodations, tourism and food: 
::*cheap: US$30 for one person, US$50 for two (at 3,000 pesos per dollar).
::*comfortable: US$60 for one person, maybe  US$100 for two.

'''Typical prices''': modest but clean (and occasionally charming) hotel: US$25 (50,000 COP), nice meal: US$15 for two, beers: US$0.60-1.50 depending on bar, bus: 100&nbsp;km about US$6 (cheaper per km for longer trips, more for dirt roads), urban transport: 50 US cents.

"Installments or one payment": When you get your check at restaurants, you will be asked two questions - credit? (credit card or something else)  and whether you want to pay all at once or in installments.  If you say "credito" and "uno" to the questions that are asked, you will probably be answering the questions correctly.

==Eat==
In many areas of Colombia, it is common to have ''buñuelos'' (deep fried corn flour balls with cheese in the dough) and ''arepas'' (rather thick corn tortillas, often made with cheese and served with butter) with scrambled eggs for breakfast. [[Bogotá]] and the central region have its own breakfast delicacy of tamales -  maize and chopped pork or chicken with vegetables and eggs, steamed in banana leaves, often served with home-made hot chocolate.

Empanadas, made with potato and meat with a pouch-like yellow exterior, are delicious and entirely different from their Mexican counterparts. Pastry is prevalent, both salty and sweet, including Pandebono, Pan de Yuca, Pastel Gloria, and Roscon. These vary in quality—ask the locals for the best niche places to indulge.

For lunch, especially on Sundays, you should try a sancocho de gallina (rich chicken soup, served with part of the chicken itself, rice and vegetables/salad). Sancocho is widespread throughout the country, with countless regional variants. On the coast it features fish, and is highly recommended. Another soup, served in [[Bogotá]] and the periphery, is Ajiaco (chicken soup made with three different kinds of potato, vegetables and herbs(guasca), served with rice, avocado, corn, milk cream and capers).

"Bandeja paisa" is common in most places, (the "paisas" are the natives from some departments in the northwest, such as [[Antioquia]], [[Caldas]], [[Risaralda]] and [[Quindío]]). This includes rice, beans, fried plantain, arepa, fried egg, chorizo, chicharrón (pork crackling) with the meat still attached. It's a very fatty dish, but you can leave what you don't like, and if you're lucky enough, you could find a gourmet ''bandeja paisa'' in a good restaurant in Bogotá or [[Medellín]]. They are lighter and smaller.

There are a few chains throughout the country. In addition to worldwide franchises (McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Subway, T.G.I.F., which are specially focused on Bogotá and other big cities), Colombian chains are very strong and located in almost every city. Presto and especially El Corral serve outstanding burgers, Kokoriko makes broiled chicken and Frisby specializes in roasted chicken. Gokela is the first choice among people wanting healthy options such as wraps, salads, super foods, supplements and subsequently one of the only options for vegetarians, vegans and organic eaters.  Crêpes and Waffles, as the name indicates, is an upscale breakfast/brunch restaurant with spectacular, well, crêpes and waffles. There are many international restaurants, including rodizios (Brazilian steak house style), paella houses, etc.

A great variety of tropical fruits can be tasted, and the corresponding variety in juices, from some of the oddest ones you can find around the globe (really) to the sweetest ones. You just must know how to find and prepare them. Anyway, anyone would be pleased to teach you. Some examples of those exotic fruits include: tamarinds, mangoes, guanabanas, lulo, mangostines, borojo, araza, copoacu, and a great variety in citrus.  In addition, you can find some of those rich and strange flavors in prepared food like ice cream brands or restaurant juices. Most of Colombians drink juices at home and in restaurants, they are inexpensive and natural everywhere.

In Colombia there are a great variety of "tamales" if you like them, but be aware they are very different from their most famous Mexican cousins. They differ from region to region, but all of them are delicious.  They are called "envuelto", the sweet tamale made of corn.

Regarding coffee, you can find a lot of products that are both made commercially and home-made from this very famous Colombian product, like wines, cookies, candies, milk-based desserts like "arequipe", ice-cream, etc.

Colombians are famous for having a sweet tooth, so you are going to find a lot of desserts and local candies like "bocadillo"  made of guayaba (guava fruit), or the most famous milk-based "arequipe" (similar to its Argentinian cousin "dulce leche" or the French "confiture de lait"). That just covers the basics, since every region in Colombia has its own fruits, local products, and therefore its own range of sweet products. If you are a lover of rare candies, you could get artisan-made candies in the little towns near Bogotá and Tunja.

The "tres leches" cake is not to be missed - a sponge cake soaked in milk, covered in whipped cream, then served with condensed milk, it is for the serious dairy fiend only. Another delicious dessert is 'leche asada', like a grilled milk.

Organic food is a current trend in big cities, but in little towns you can get fruits and veggies all very natural and fresh. Colombians aren't used to storing food for the winter, since there are no seasons in the traditional sense. So don't ask them for dried items like dried tomatoes or fruits. All you have to do is go shopping at the little grocery stores nearby and pick up the freshest of the harvest of the month (almost everything is available and fresh all year).  As for pickles and related preserved food, you can find them in supermarkets, but they are not common in family households.

Pre-Columbian civilizations cultivated about 200 varieties of potatoes. Colombia as an Andean country, is not the exception. Even McDonalds recognizes the quality of this product and buys them.  Try the local preparations like "papas saladas" (salted potatoes) or "papas chorriadas" (stewed potatoes).

All in all, in Colombia it can be fun to have the ingredients and the preparation of a lot of exotic recipes explained to you.

==Drink==
For breakfast, have a home-made hot drink. The choices normally include coffee, hot chocolate or "agua de panela". The latter is a drink prepared with panela (dried cane juice), sometimes with cinnamon and cloves, which gives it a special taste. In Bogotá and the region around, is a custom to use cheese along with the drink, in a way that small pieces of cheese are put into the cup and then after they are melt, you can use a spoon to pick them up and eat it like a soup. Hot chocolate is drunk in the same way.

Colombia's national alcoholic beverage, Aguardiente (A.K.A. ''guaro''), tastes strongly of anise, and is typically bought by the bottle or half bottle or a quarter. People usually drink it in shots. Each region has its own aguardiente, "Antioqueño" (from Antioquia), "Cristal" (from Caldas), "Quindiano" (from [[Quindío]]), "Blanco del Valle" (from Valle del Cauca) and "Nectar" (from Cundinamarca). There is also a variety of rum beverages, like "Ron Santa Fe" (also from Cundinamarca), "Ron Medellin Añejo" (also from Antioquia), "Ron Viejo de Caldas" (also from Caldas) among others.

The water is drinkable straight from the tap in most of the major cities, but be prepared to buy some bottles if you go to the countryside. Agua Manantial Bottled water is recommended, it comes from a natural spring near Bogotá. Some advice, make sure you do not use ice cubes, or drink any beverage that might contain non distilled water, ask if the beverage is made with tap or bottled/boiled water.

If you are lucky enough, and if you are staying in a familiar "finca cafetera" (coffee farm) you can ask your Colombian friends not only for the selected coffee (quality export) but for the remaining coffee that the farmers leave to their own use.  This is manually picked, washed, toasted in rustic brick stoves and manually ground. It has the most exquisite and rare flavor and aroma ever found.

In Bogota and the rest of the country, black filter coffee is referred to as "tinto" - confusing if you were expecting red wine.

Also, you can find specialized places where you can drink coffee with many different combinations (like Juan Valdez Café or Oma), hot or frozen preparations.

Commercially, you can find a lot of products made out of coffee too like wines, ice-creams, soda-pops and other beverages.

==Sleep==
In Colombia you can find a range of options, bed and breakfast conditioned to western standards and [[hostels]] to five-star hotels.  There are also apartments that rent per day. In many cities, affordable hotels can be found near bus terminals catering to locals. You can get a basic private room from 10,000 to 15,000 COP, which is cheaper than most hostel dorms, though be aware of the safety of the neighborhoods. It is worth mentioning that hot showers are a rarity in northern Colombia however with the warm climate the water is warm enough to make showering reasonably pleasant.

==Learn==
Colombia education is generally strict and is kept to high standards. Most Colombian degrees can be legalized in foreign countries. In contrast to American education, a typical Bachelor's degree program in Colombia is 160 credits or 5 years long. You can find several programs in different universities around the country.

===Learn Spanish===
Colombia is currently the fastest growing "Study Spanish Abroad" destination in the world and with good reason. Within Latin America, Colombian Spanish is considered to be the purest in form and clearest in accent. There is a growing number of universities and Spanish language schools in Colombia, offering excellent Spanish programs. 

'''Study Spanish Colombia''' [http://www.studyspanishcolombia.com] is an independent organisation dedicated to promoting Spanish language education throughout Colombia. They list 100% of the options to learn Spanish in Colombia and assist hundreds of students every month asking for advice about the best Spanish language schools and universities in Colombia. They also manage the the largest list of private teachers in South America available for private Spanish lessons or Spanish lessons by Skype. Additional free services include visa advice, booking accommodation, homestays, personalized tours and salsa lessons. 

'''Spanish in Colombia''' [http://www.spanishincolombia.gov.co] is the government's promotional website where you can also find the best institutional programs, their specifications, costs, duration and geographic location to learn Spanish.

'''Learn Spanish in Colombia''' [https://totalspanishcolombia.com/spanish-lessons-medellin.html] with Total Spanish.  Based in the heart of Medellin they are one of the best rated schools in Colombia and an excellent choice for both beginners and advanced learners.

===Learn Salsa===
Colombia is one of the mother countries of Salsa and you will be able to listen to this music all over the place. In the last years several of the Salsa World Champions came from Colombia. Especially in Cali and Cartagena there are plenty of clubs and schools. If you want to experience a more purely Colombian artform, however, you would do better to explore the world of cumbia instead.

==Work==
If you want to work for a national company, such as Bancolombia, Avianca, or Presto, you must be able to speak Spanish with near-native fluency. Depending on your qualifications, companies may offer Spanish lessons, however always make sure that you are indeed eligible for the position advertised. You can teach English for extra money, especially in smaller cities where the demand for it is high. Also you could work for an NGO as a volunteer.

}}

Colombia has suffered from a terrible reputation as a dangerous and violent country but the situation has improved dramatically since the '80s and '90s. Colombia is on the path to recovery, and Colombians are very proud of the progress they have made. 

The security situation differs greatly throughout the country currently. Most jungle regions are not safe to visit, but the area around [[Leticia]] is very safe, and the areas around [[Santa Marta]] are OK. No one should visit the Darien Gap at the border with [[Panama]] (in the north of [[Chocó]]), as well as [[Putumayo]] and [[Caquetá]], which are very dangerous, active conflict zones. Other departments with significant rural violence include the departments of [[Chocó]], [[Cauca]], and [[Valle del Cauca]]; eastern [[Meta]], [[Vichada]], and [[Arauca]] in [[Orinoquía|the east]]; and all [[Amazonia (Colombia)|Amazonian departments]] except for [[Amazonas (Colombia)|Amazonas]]. That's not to say that these departments are totally off-limits—just be sure you are either traveling with locals who know the area, or sticking to cities and tourist destinations.

===Landmines===
Colombia is currently one of the most mine-affected countries in the world. So don't walk around blithely through the countryside without consulting locals. Land mines are found in 31 out of Colombia's 32 departments, and new ones are planted every day by guerrillas, paramilitaries, and drug traffickers.

===Paramilitaries===
There was an agreement in 2005 with the government which resulted in the disarmament of some of the paramilitaries. Paramilitaries however are still active in drug business, extortion rackets, and as a political force. They do not target tourists specifically, but running up against an illegal rural roadblock in more dangerous departments is possible.

===Kidnappings===
At the end of the 90s and in the early 2000s, kidnapping became one of the most cost-effective ways of financing for the guerrillas of the FARC and the ELN and other armed groups but, thanks to improvements in security and the progressive weakening of the guerrillas, criminal organizations, and other armed groups, the number of kidnappings in Colombia has been constantly declining. 3,000 Kidnappings took place in 2000 while 229 cases occurred in 2011. The number of kidnappings continues to decline. Kidnappings are still a problem in some southern departments like [[Cauca]] and [[Caquetá]]. Colombia happily no longer has the highest rate of kidnappings in the world. Colombian law makes the payment of ransom illegal.

===Guerrillas===
After four years of negotiations, in 2016 the Colombian government signed a peace deal with the FARC, ending more than 50 years of conflict. Now, the main guerrilla movement is the ELN, which is in the midst of its own peace talks with the government. The remaining guerrillas operate in rural areas, but their presence is greatly diminished. If you stick to the main roads between major cities and do not wander off the beaten track, you are far more likely to encounter soldiers from the Colombian army than guerrillas. River police, highway police, newspapers, and fellow travelers can be a useful source of information off-the-beaten-path.

===Crime===
The crime rate in Colombia has been significantly reduced since its peak in the late '80s and '90s. However, major urban centers and the countryside Colombia still have very high violent crime rates, comparable to blighted cities in the [[United States of America|United States]], and crime has has been on the increase in recent (prior to 2013) years. In the downtown areas of most cities (which rarely coincides with the wealthy parts of town) violent crime is not rare; poor sections of cities can be quite dangerous for someone unfamiliar with their surroundings. Taxi crime is a very serious danger in major cities, so always request taxis by phone, rather than hailing them off the street—it costs the same and your call will be answered rapidly. Official taxi ranks are safe as well (airports, bus terminals, shopping malls).

===Drugs===
Local consumption is low, and penalties are draconian, owing to the nation's well-known largely successful fight against some of history's most powerful and dangerous traffickers. Cocaine manufactured in Colombia was historically mostly consumed in the US and the [[EU]], and the United States of America is still the world's largest consumer of illegal drugs. Remember that the drug trade in Colombia has ruined many innocent citizens' lives and dragged the country's reputation through the mud.

The Colombian government has a strong commitment to fight drug production and trade. A previous president, Alvaro Uribe, with significant aid from the US government, led a policy of massively destroying drug plantations using chemical defoliants, achieving a great decrease in cocaine production. 

Marijuana is illegal. Police will tolerate you having a few grams of this particular drug on your person, but you are flirting with danger if you carry much more. Especially in small towns, it is not always the police you have to deal with, but vigilantes. They often keep the peace in towns, and they have a very severe way of dealing with problems. Given Colombia's increasing aggression toward combating the drug trade, drug offenses are not treated lightly. If you are caught by the authorities possessing a controlled substance, expect serious problems.

'''Scopolamine''' is an extremely dangerous drug from an Andean flowering tree, which is almost exclusively used for crime. Essentially a ''mind control drug'' (once experimented with as an interrogation device by the CIA), victims become extremely open to suggestion and are "talked into" ATM withdrawals, turning over belongings, letting criminals into their apartments, etc., all while maintaining an outward appearance of more or less sobriety. After affects include near total amnesia of what happened, as well as potential for serious medical problems. The most talked about method of getting drugged with scopolamine is that of powder blown off paper, e.g., someone walks up to you (with cotton balls in their nose to prevent blowback) and asks for help with a map, before blowing the drugs into your face. This is most likely a myth, and the most common method is by drugging drinks at a bar. To be especially safe, abandon drinks if they've been left unattended. While a pretty rare problem, it's an awful scary one, and happens most often in strip clubs.

==Stay healthy==
Drink only bottled water outside the major cities. The water in major cities is safe. Most drinking water in people's homes is of the purified variety that comes in huge multi-gallon plastic bags (which you can find at any little grocery store). The coffee's delicious, though, so why not just start that habit!

[[Tropical diseases]] are a concern in lowland parts of the country, and more so outside of major cities. Mosquitos carry [[malaria]], [[Yellow fever]], and [[Dengue fever|Dengue]], and infection rates are similar to other lowland parts of [[South America]] (i.e., much lower than in sub-Saharan Africa). Yellow fever has a vaccine, so get it—it's required for entry to many national parks, anyway. Dengue is not preventable beyond avoiding mosquito bites, so using bug spray regularly in lowland rural areas is good sense.

Malaria is the one that can kill you within 24 hours of infection, so trips outside [[Bogotá]], [[Medellín]], [[Cartagena (Colombia)|Cartagena]], and the [[Andino|Andean region]] warrant use of antimalarials, which can be bought ''very'' cheaply without a prescription from a ''droguería'', which are everywhere in any city of any size throughout the country. Ask for Doxycicline tablets at a dosage of 100 mg, with the number being 30 days plus the number of days in a malarial area (so you can start 1-2 days in advance, and take it daily continuing for 4 weeks past the end of your trip). The phrase you want is: ''doxiciclina, cien miligramos, [number] pastillas''. Using some bug spray in the evening serves as a bit of extra protection.

==Respect==
Colombians are acutely aware of their country's bad reputation, and tactless remarks about the history of violence might earn you a snide remark (likely regarding your country of origin) and an abrupt end to the conversation. However, Colombians eventually become willing to discuss these topics once they feel comfortable enough with someone.

Colombians are more formal than much of Latin America. Make a point to say "please" ("Por favor" or "Hágame el favor") and "thank you" ("muchas gracias") for anything, to anyone. When addressed, the proper response is "¿Señora?" or "¿Señor?" In parts of the country (especially [[Boyacá]]) Colombians can be formal to the point of anachronism, calling strangers "Su merced" (your Mercy!) in place of usted. The one (much) more informal part of the country is along the [[Costa Norte (Colombia)|Caribbean coast]], where referring to people just as "chico" can be more the norm—but take your cues from those around you.

Race is not a hot issue in Colombia, since whites, criollos, and mestizos (mixed race) blend naturally with natives and Afro-Colombians in everyday life (education, living, politics, marriage).  Differences between white foreigners are not dwelled upon: expect to be called "gringo" even if you are, say, Russian. Unless context includes anger, it's not meant to be offensive. If you are black, you will probably be referred to as "negro" or "moreno," which also are not considered at all offensive. Asians are usually called "chino" (Chinese), regardless of actual background. Confusingly, Colombians also occasionally refer to children as chinos ("kids"); this use comes from Chibcha, an indigenous language. Even more confusingly, Colombians refer to blondes and redheads as "monos" (monkeys). It sounds offensive, but actually ranges from neutral to affectionate. 

Colombians have the mannerism of pointing to objects with their chins; pointing to a person or even an object with your finger can be considered rude.

Avoid indicating a person's height using your hand palm down, as this is considered reserved for animals or inanimate objects. If you must, use your palm facing sidewards with the bottom of the hand expressing the height.

Colombians dance a lot. Anyone will be glad to teach you how to dance, and they will not expect you to do it correctly, since they have been practicing every weekend for most of their lives. Colombian night life centers mostly on dancing, and bars where people sit or stand are less common outside major cities. 

Despite the sensual movements, dancing is normally not intended as flirtation. Here you could find salsa being danced at a children's "piñata" party, or even at parties for older people. North Americans and Europeans could find this odd or confusing because of the use of salsa and Latin rhythms in their countries. A Colombian dancing innocently could be misinterpreted, and in general, Colombian women or men are not "easy" just because of the way they dance. It is applied in the same way as in Brazil—an almost-naked "garota" dancing samba in the carnival is not inviting you to have sex with her but inviting you to enjoy, to be happy, to join in the celebration, to join the exuberant shedding of inhibitions.

Regarding religion, most Colombians are Catholic, and it´s important to them to keep certain ceremonies and respect for all things related to religion. You could visit great architectural churches, even going inside, but taking pictures may be considered disrespectful during a mass celebration. Young people are more open to learning about other religions and debate on this subject, and you may even find a lot of them who may consider themselves as lapsed, non-practicing Catholics or even non-religious.

===Gay and lesbian travelers===
Most Colombians are Catholic, although you'll find that young people are increasingly quite relaxed about religion, especially with regards to social issues, atheism and agnosticism also is growing through younger Colombians. Public displays of affection are rare, though, and may elicit uncomfortable stares. Verbal and physical homophobic violence is not necessarily unheard of, and unfortunately less aggressive homophobia may be more widespread than what politeness masks. Overall, Colombian attitudes to homosexuality are pretty similar to what you find in the United States.

You can find more liberally-minded areas (at least about LGBT issues) in Bogotá's [[Bogotá/Chapinero-Zona G|Chapinero]] district. It is home to what may be the biggest LGBT community in Colombia, and is the focal point of the community's nightlife in Bogotá (if not the whole country), with explicitly gay-friendly establishments such as Theatron (arguably one of the biggest discos in South America) [http://www.theatron.co/]. LGBT pride parades also take place in some of the major cities sometime around late June and early July. [http://off2colombia.com/gay-pride-bogota]

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Colombia since April 2016.

As usual, don't list individual telephone centres or Internet cafés; save those for the city listings where they're located. -->
===By phone===

====Carriers====
It's simple enough to get a SIM card and even an unlocked phone at the international airport in [[Bogotá]], although there is, of course, a price hike. They're not hard to find in any city either, just ask your hotel or hostel staff where to go. Topping up is also easy, and can be done pretty much on any street corner.

The carriers you'll most likely see are Claro, Tigo, and Movistar. Claro is the most expensive (by a little bit), but it is said that it has the widest coverage in the country, if you expect to get off the beaten path; althougth the quality of service have been decreasing during the last years. Other carriers are Virgin Mobile, which uses the network of movistar, Exito Movil (cheaper rates, but harder for tourists to get, and Uff! Móvil, which uses the network of Tigo. You can get SIM cards for the latter two at Exito supermarkets.

NOTE: It seems that it is necessary (as of April 2016) to "register" your phone after you start using a Colombian SIM card. If you do not register your phone within a certain amount of time (about 2 weeks) your phone will be blocked and unusable with any Colombian cell network. To register you need to use a Colombian identification. So you may need to find a Colombian friend to do this for you.

Dialing Colombian numbers is complicated, with several systems.

'''From landlines''': 

To call from a landline to another local landline, dial the normal seven digits. To call from a landline to a mobile, dial twelve digits, always beginning with 03, followed by the ten digit number provided.

It's far more complex to make long-distance domestic calls or international calls. Ask whoever owns the phone to dial it for you. If that's not an option, buy a mobile phone. Seriously. 

'''From mobiles''': 

To call from a mobile to a landline, you must dial 03 + area code + the seven digit number. To call a mobile from a mobile is easy—just dial the ten digits. Long distance is not an issue.

Calling internationally is much harder, and requires figuring out which long distance carrier to call. The formula is 00 + long distance carrier code + country code + number. But why on earth aren't you just Skyping from an Internet café?

'''From abroad''':

To call a Colombian landline from another country, use the +57 country code then the eight digit number (the first of which is the area code). To dial a mobile phone from abroad, dial +57 and then the ''ten'' digit number.

===By internet===
Internet cafes are easy to find in any city or town. Expect rates to run about $1,250-2,500 (around $US0.50-1) per hour, depending on how much competition there is (i.e., cheap in Bogotá, expensive in the middle of nowhere). Quality of connection is directly related to the centrality of location, and hence inversely related to price.

[http://www.discovernauru.com '''Nauru'''] is a small island in the [[Oceania|South Pacific Ocean]], south of the [[Marshall Islands]] and is the world's third smallest independent republic.

==Understand==

Although other island states may be smaller in area and/or less populous, they are all dependent territories of other countries, so Nauru keeps the title of the world's third smallest independent republic.

First inhabited by Micronesians and Polynesians, Nauru was annexed by Germany in 1888. In 1900, Nauru's phosphate deposits, which occupied about 90% of the island at the time, were discovered and began to be mined under a German-British consortium. During World War I, the island was occupied by Australian forces. After the war, the island became a League of Nations joint mandate (later a United Nations trusteeship after the Japanese occupation for three years during World War II) under Australia, the United Kingdom and New Zealand. 

Nauru achieved independence in 1968. In the years following independence, phosphate exports briefly gave Nauruans the highest per capita income in the world. The primary phosphate reserves were soon exhausted, crashing the local economy in the process, but in 2006–07 mining of a deeper layer of "secondary phosphate" began. As of 2016, most of Nauru's revenue came from the export of phosphate. The industry is controlled by the Nauru Phosphate Corporation (NPC). It is anticipated that the phosphate reserves will be completely exhausted before 2050. The sale of fishing licences is the other major revenue raiser. Countries such as Australia and Taiwan provide substantial development cooperation funding. Despite this, the unemployment rate currently stands at 90%, which is the highest in the world. That is not the only problem on the island, as over 95% of the population is obese and over 40% suffer from diabetes.
  
In 2001 the Norwegian container ship ''Tampa'' rescued several hundred asylum seekers from a sinking Indonesian vessel and attempted to deliver them to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, which is an Australian Federal Territory. In what was labelled ''The Pacific Solution'', the Australian Government established a controversial Off Shore Processing Centre (OPC) on Nauru where these people were housed, pending assessment of their claims to be refugees. The OPC was closed in early 2008, and re-opened in 2012. The OPC still remains very controversial owing to its extremely negative human rights record. As of 2016, there are approximately 470 people - chiefly of Middle Eastern origin - held in the OPC. 

===Climate===

The climate is tropical, with some rain occurring between November and February. 

===Terrain===

There are a few "sandy" beaches but most of the shallow area around the island is coral reefs. Most of the interior of the island is worked-out mining land, which is to be rehabilitated.

There is a lagoon on the island, the only body of water there.

==Get in== 
[[Image:Nauru map.png|thumb|right|500px|Map of Nauru]]

All foreign visitors require a valid passport valid for at least 3 months, a 30 day tourist visa and proof of hotel booking or local sponsor in order to enter Nauru. 

Nationals of [[Cook Islands]], [[Fiji]], [[Israel]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Micronesia]], [[Niue]], [[Palau]], [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Russia]], [[Samoa]], [[Solomon Islands]]. [[Taiwan]], [[Tonga]], [[Tuvalu]] and [[Vanuatu]] may obtain a free visa on arrival.

All other nationals must obtain a visa from their local Nauruan embassy before departure. There have been rumours on the Internet that you can get in for up to three days without getting a visa, but that is not accurate. 

===By plane=== 

Nauru's national carrier [http://nauruairlines.com.au/ Nauru Airlines] flies to Nauru International Airport from [[Brisbane]] ([[Australia]]), [[Tarawa]] ([[Kiribati]]), [[Kosrae]] ([[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]), [[Majuro]] ([[Marshall Islands]]), [[Nadi]] ([[Fiji]]) and [[Pohnpei]] (Micronesia). Schedules change throughout the year; further details are available from the website.

==Get around==
Nauru is so small that it takes less than one hour to drive right around it. The airport runway cuts across three of the twenty kilometres of road. The only traffic lights on the island are used to stop the traffic and allow the plane to cross the road to the terminal! This is a favourite souvenir snapshot taken by visitors. 

Traffic drives on the left. The 19km Island Ring Road circles the island. Drivers should be on increased lookout for animals and pedestrians while driving on the beltway. There is a community bus which travels around the island every hour or so during the day.  Cars or bicycles can sometimes be rented from Capelle and Partners, the largest local supermarket.

==Talk== 

The official language is '''Nauruan''', a distinct Pacific Island language.  Some locals speak Tuvaluan or Gilbertese which are quite common around the island since these two ethnic groups have historically worked in the Nauru mining industry. 

'''English''' is widely understood, spoken, and used for most government and commercial purposes.

==See==
* '''Anibare Bay''' where there are tropical beaches
* '''Anibare Harbour''', a 2000 project, was largely financed by the Japanese government
* The Parliament House and other '''Government buildings''' in Yaren, the unofficial capital of Nauru
* The '''Buada Lagoon''' a tropical body of water, and the only body of water on the island is a very picturesque spot in the lower middle of the island. It's a freshwater lagoon surrounded on all sides by dense palm trees and other vegetation. However the water is dirty and not suitable for swimming in. Still, a nice photo opportunity, and you can walk all the way around the lagoon as the sealed road circles it. To get there, take the road opposite the Od-N-Aiwo hotel, follow it until it branches, then go left. The road will lead you straight there.

==Do==
* '''Walk''' round the islands interior. Do the circuit - A sealed road goes all the way around the island so you can drive, ride or walk around an entire country! A drive takes about 25 minutes non-stop. A bicycle ride would take 2-3 hours and a walk maybe 6 hours. There is lots of nice scenery if not much to do and, going from either hotel, Cappelle & Partner department store right at the top of the island in Ewa district makes for a welcome break at halfway around.
*'''Explore''' World war relics In Yaren. Spot the remains of Japanese guns, bunkers and pillboxes left over from WW2.
*'''Climb''' Command Ridge, Nauru's highest point.
*'''Watch''' the local teams battle it out at an Australian rules football match. The national game is played all through Saturday at the Linkbelt Oval sports field.
*'''Fish''': Head out to sea and try your luck at game fishing
*'''Shop''' at '''Capelle & Partner''', the only department store and largest business on Nauru island.
*'''Swim''' in Anibore Harbour, which is the best bet for swimming, as most beaches are too shallow and rocky.

==Buy==

Nauru uses the '''Australian dollar ($)''' as its national currency. Cash transactions are the norm; credit cards are rarely accepted. There are 8 ATMs on the island; 1 is situated at Meneng Hotel, Capelle and Partner's Supermarket, Nauru International Airport and 4 at the Bendigo Bank.

==Eat==
Food is imported from Australia and arrives by ship and plane, usually every week as the vessels have been in operation regularly. There are lots of small "eating places", selling Chinese food.  There is a fast food kiosk at Capelle's supermarket served by the locals and at Milton Ross supermarket served by Filipinos.  There is also another fast food take away at McDon's, serving Filipino dishes.

Nauru has a serious obesity problem, as will become apparent as soon as you arrive. The decision to mine the phosphates led to almost complete loss of agricultural land, with the  result that almost everything is imported. Such imported foods are usually processed and high in sugar and fat. Several studies have cited the country as the fattest in the world.

==Stay safe==
Like many other Pacific Islands, Nauru is surrounded by a shallow reef with cut-outs through the reef providing access for boats and harbours, and there can be strong currents across the shallow water, moving boats in the harbours, and dangerous marine animals on the reef floor. Ask for advice before venturing into the water.

The trafficking of drugs and narcotics of any kind will be punished severely. 

Although homosexual acts in Nauru were legalised in 2016, open displays of affection between same-sex partners may offend some.

The island hosts an immigration processing center for nearby Australia as a source of income. Do not trespass on the property, and while very unlikely, watch out for possible escapees and report anything suspicious to local police.

==Stay healthy==
Water supply in Nauru is dependent on rainwater collected into tanks from the roofs of houses and from an ageing reverse osmosis desalination plant.

* Emergency: 112 or 110
* Nauru General Hospital: +674 555-4302

==Respect==

Be respectful to the native people and their environment. As the nation has one of the highest obesity rates in the world, pointing out someone's obesity will almost always be taken poorly and cause offense. Use common sense, and avoid other actions that are considered rude internationally. Be respectful of the wildlife and nature, and remember that it has all been there long before any humans.

The island nation allows freedom of religion, but most of the island practices Christianity, so be respectful of any and all religious practices. While the constitution allows any religion to be practiced, religious practices under the Church of Latter Day Saints and the Jehovah's Witnesses have been limited.

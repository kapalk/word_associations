[http://www.cameroun-infotourisme.com/english/index.html '''Cameroon'''] is in [[West Africa]]. It borders [[Nigeria]] to the west, [[Chad]] to the northeast, the [[Central African Republic]] to the east and [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south. 

While Cameroon is not the largest country in Africa, in some ways it's as large as Africa itself. Known as "Africa in miniature" it features French and English speaking portions, Muslim and Christian dominated regions, the tallest mountain in West Africa and terrain that includes rain forest, desert plains, mountains and high plateau.

==Understand==
Cameroon is a diverse and multi ethnic country. American tourism is rare; most of the country's tourists come from Europe (predominantly Belgium).

===History===
The territory of present day Cameroon was first settled during the Neolithic period. Portuguese sailors reached the coast in 1472. Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian missionaries pushed inland. In the early 19th century, Modibo Adama led Fulani soldiers on a jihad in the north against non-Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and established the Adamawa Emirate. Settled peoples who fled the Fulani caused a major redistribution of population.

The German Empire claimed the territory as the colony of Kamerun in 1884 and began a steady push inland. With the defeat of Germany in World War I, Kamerun became a League of Nations mandate territory and was split into French Cameroun and British Cameroons in 1919. The French carefully integrated the economy of Cameroun with that of France and improved the infrastructure with capital investments, skilled workers, and continued forced labour.

The British administered their territory from neighbouring Nigeria. Natives complained that this made them a neglected "colony of a colony". The League of Nations mandates were converted into United Nations Trusteeships in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun. France outlawed the most radical political party, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This prompted a long guerilla war. In British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.

On 1 January 1960, French Cameroun gained independence from France under President Ahmadou Ahidjo, and on 1 October 1961, the formerly British Northern Cameroons became a part of Nigeria, while the formerly British Southern Cameroons united with its neighbour to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon.

===Climate===

===By plane===

Camair-Co [http://www.camair-co.cm/en.html] is currently operating as a national carrier and on domestic flights.

===By train===

Train service, Camrail [http://www.camrail.net/], exists from the capital, Yaoundé, to the port city of Douala and the northern city of Ngaoundéré. While bus service is quicker and more reliable to Douala, the overnight train is the best mode of ground transport to the north. Check for current schedules and pricing.

===By bus===

Between major cities you can get a ride on modern, comfortable buses, sometimes with air conditioning. Away from the larger centers you will most likely end up on the ever-present Toyota bush taxis. These are slightly elongated Toyota minivans that can hold up to 20 people (or more if necessary) along with their luggage piled up on top. Safety can be a concern with dangerous roads, overworked/drunk/hungover drivers and poorly-maintained vehicles the norm. However, other than extending your stay an extra day or 2, in bad weather your options are limited.

Note that buses rarely leave at a set time; instead, they wait until they are full and then depart. Later in the day, buses sometimes never fill up. When this happens, the operator will normally set you up with a bush taxi to take you to your destination. If you do not want to take the bush taxi and are persistent enough, the operator will normally refund your money. The point is that you should leave plenty of time to get to your destination, because sometimes the wait will take hours and you are never guaranteed a departure.

===By car===

Rental cars are available although a bit expensive compared to car renting in major cities in the Western world. As paved roads are rare away from the major cities of the west and northwest, a 4 x 4 is a necessity when traveling to the eastern or central areas of Cameroon. The roads in the north are paved between cities and even the dirt roads tend to be in decent condition due to the lack of rain.

Few of the car renting companies in Yaounde include [https://secoursauto.com secoursauto.com]. They claim to be professional, affordable and can provide advice for the type of car depending of the travel location.

==Talk==

'''[[French phrasebook|French]]''' and '''English''' are the country's two official languages. Two of the ten regions of Cameroon - in the north-west and the south-west of the country - are primarily Anglophone, representing 17% of the country's population. The ''lingua franca'' in these areas, however, is Cameroonian Pidgin English.

The remainder of the country is primarily Francophone. , Most Cameroonians speak either French or English and a third indigenous language. Cameroon is home to 230 languages, with Fulfulde being the lingua franca in the north, and Ewondo in much of the Centre, South, and East provinces.

==See==
Visit the Limbe Botanic Garden, Benedictine Museum of Mont Febe, National Museum of Yaounde and the Kribi. These are famous attractions in the city of Yaounde, meant for tourists.

Fresh fish and prawns in Youppe village, close to Douala (early morning)

Cash machines in the Mastercard/Maestro/Cirrus network are nonexistent. Master Card cash machines are available at SCB bank. Cash advances are NOT available as of December 2007.

==Costs==

Unless you are in stores and restaurants, you must bargain for everything. Offer 20-50% of the first price requested.

==Eat==

There are plenty of good restaurants:
* Bonapriso quarter: Sorento, Bistrot Latin, Peche Mignon, Bombay Masala (Indian, Oriental), Oriental Garden (chinese), Alladin (lebanese), Paradise (nice English bar), Piccolla Venezia (italian), Ovalie (classy, expensive), Le Bouchon Lyonaise (French), Le BOJ (French), Le Cabanon

Mont Febe, Hilton Hotel and hotel le depute in Yaounde, Atlantic Beach Hotel, Mirama hotel, Guest House hotel and Park hotel in Limbe, 3813 in Tiko, Miss Bright in Buea and Meridien hotel Douala.

==Drink==

[[Image:Hut Cameroon.jpg|thumb|180px|Hut in the small village of Bana]] 

Always check “best before” when buying a bottle - some drinks are way out of date.

Avoid drinking tap water, even in restaurants. Bottled water can be found most anywhere at reasonable prices. Expect to pay 400 cfa for 1.5l in the major cities, more in more remote areas.

Coca-Cola is available everywhere. For something different try one of the flavourful TOP sodas. They are much sweeter than most European or North American sodas but they are very tasty.

Cameroon is rich with choice when it comes to good beer due to its past as a German and later French colony. Bottled Guinness can be found everywhere although in the heat, try one of the excellent lighter beers such as Castel, Beaufort, Mützig, Isenbeck, Satzenbrau or 33. These are inexpensive and excellent in the heat. Castel Milk Stout is an excellent choice for those who like darker beer. Outside of the cities you will sometimes be hard pressed to find them chilled (due to a lack of electricity).

==Sleep==
Hotels in the major cities will range from XAF6000 up to and in excess of XAF50,000. Clean and safe rooms can usually be found for under XAF11,000. 

In more rural areas, prices vary wildly depending on demand and local economy. It is not uncommon to find comfortable accommodation for XAF2000-3000 per night.

Unless you are with a guide on a trek it is '''not recommended that you camp''' due to security concerns.

==Stay safe==
Violence is rare, but be smart about wearing jewelry or anything else that would make you stand apart from the crowd. Take a taxi after dark if you're unsure of the area. Be aware that Boko Haram, a Nigerian jihadist group, operates with other Islamists and Salafists in the north of Cameroon, and they have kidnapped Europeans, Canadians, Americans and other Westerners there. Boko Haram may implement very harsh forms of sharia law including amputation for theft. Churchgoers should not proselytize to Muslims, gathering in large groups should be avoided due to possible suicide bombings, and alcohol should not be consumed in public. Boko Haram usually travel on motorbikes and in pick-up trucks. An offshoot with links to al-Qaeda, the ''Ansar Muslimeen fi Biladi Sudan'', which translates as "Protection of Muslims in Black Lands", also carries out attacks and harsh sharia-compliant punishments.

===Homosexuality===
Homosexuality is '''illegal''' in Cameroon and penalties range from 5 years imprisonment to a '''death sentence''' LGBT should avoid Cameroon at all costs.

==Stay healthy==

Yellow Fever certificates are required for travel to Cameroon.

Malaria is common, especially in the central and southern parts of the country; the risk is much lower in the mountains of the Northwest Province and the arid areas in the extreme north. Prophylactics are recommended because of the severity of some strains of malaria in the country.

Other tropical diseases are also common, including dysentery, bilharzia, hepatitis, and giardia. There are occasional outbreaks of cholera in Yaounde and Douala, but these rarely affect travelers. 

There are several good-quality hospitals in the country. Most are located in Douala or Yaounde, but Kumbo has two very good private hospitals as well.

It's highly recommended that you receive required vaccinations beforehand.

==Contact==

[[Image:Internet in Cameroon.jpg|thumb|250px|Internet access point]]

To make local and international calls you need to buy a pre-paid SIM
card. Check if your cell phone has a compatible GSM standard (Africa/Europe) - if not, in addition to a SIM card
you probably need to buy a new phone. "MTN" and "Orange" are two
major telephone companies in Cameroon.

You can find Internet access all over the place, but the speed might be slow.

National post service is considered to be unreliable.

==Respect==

It is disrespectful to shake hands with your left hand, so use only your right. If you have something in your right hand or your right hand is dirty or wet, it is polite to extend your wrist for the person to shake with his right hand. If both of your hands are occupied, it is polite to touch wrists.

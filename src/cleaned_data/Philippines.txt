The Philippines ([[Filipino]]: ''Pilipinas'') is an archipelago in [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]] of more than seven thousand islands located between the Philippine Sea and the South China Sea at the very eastern edge of Asia. 

Many wonderful beaches are just part of one of the world's longest coastlines and it takes about 20 years to spend a day on every island. Since Spanish colonial times, the country has been '''Asia's largest Catholic country'''. Over a hundred ethnic groups, a mixture of foreign influences and a fusion of culture and arts have enhanced the uniqueness of the Filipino identity and the wonder that is the Philippines. 

==Understand==
The Philippines is an archipelago that consists of 7,641 islands with a total land area of 301,780 square kilometers (116,518 sq mi). The Philippine archipelago is divided into three island groups: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.

===History===

====First steps====
Several thousand years ago, the first settlers in the Philippines crossed shallow seas and land bridges from mainland Asia to arrive in this group of islands. These were the ''Negritos'' or ''Aetas'' related to Melanesians, Australian Aborigines and Papuans. Direct descendants of these people can still be found, especially in [[Negros Oriental]]. 

Several thousand years later, Austronesian settlers travelled the same route as the Negritos - but this time over sea in their impressive ''Balangay'' boats. (This word is where the basic form of the political institution, the baranggay, came from.) The Austronesians are thought to have come from Taiwan and travelled south to the Philippines and then ever onwards, as far away as Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Hawaii, Easter island, New Zealand and Madagascar.

====Under Spanish rule====
When the explorer '''Ferdinand Magellan''' set foot on the soil through the island of Homonhon in 1521, the Philippines was predominantly animist, with some Muslim and Hindu inhabitants mainly in the southern part of the country. Famished, Magellan's crew were treated to a feast by the welcoming islanders who wore elaborate tattoos. Magellan was Portuguese but it was a Spanish Expedition which he led to the islands which were eventually claimed by Spain as its colony. Lapu-Lapu a native chief of Mactan island was against the Christianization of the natives, he then fought a battle with Magellan where Lapu-Lapu won while Magellan was killed. The Philippines was later on named for '''Crown Prince Philip II''' of Spain and most of the natives converted to Catholicism. Some Muslims in the south and various animistic mountain tribes, however, resisted Spanish conquest and Catholic conversion.

The longest revolt against Spanish colonization was led by Francisco Dagohoy in Bohol which lasted for 85 years covering the period of 1744-1829. As a cabeza de barangay or barangay captain, Dagohoy opposed the Spanish colonizers which were represented by priests and civil leaders, imposing payment of excessive taxes, tributes. The Manila Galleon trade made contact between the Philippines and Mexico as well as the whole of the Americas. Spaniards and Natives from the Spanish colonies settled in the Philippines and introduced their cultures which then was embraced by the Filipinos. The Philippines received heavy influence from Spain and its colonies (Today Mexico, Peru, etc.), and the archipelago became "hispanicized". Other Asians used the Manila Galleon trade to migrate to the West. During the Spanish rule, people such as the Dutch, Portuguese and British tried to colonize the country, however only the British did so. It lasted for less than two years and only in the modern-day capital: Manila. The Philippines remained a Spanish colony for over 300 years until 1899 when it was ceded by Spain to the United States following the Spanish-American War.

====Under US Subjugation====
Filipinos declared independence from Spain on 12 June 1898 after defeating their Spanish occupiers, only to see Spain purport to give to the United States of America what was not theirs to give. 

The struggle continued against their new US occupiers. Filipinos then fought American colonization for seven long years of the utmost barbarism with American soldiers inflicting inventive tortures, sadistic and racist war crimes featuring in British newspapers. After the Filipinos had been out-gunned, relations between the US and their new Philippine colony continued relatively uneventfully and the Philippines were granted commonwealth status in 1935. Any time after this point (years or decades - or never), the Philippines could have become a US state or been given independence but the US prevaricated. 

Japan invaded the Philippines and the even more sadistic Japanese occupation lasted from 1941 until 1945 when US General Douglas MacArthur fulfilled his promise and liberated the US territory from the Japanese, with Americans and Filipinos fighting side by side against the Japanese. 

In 1946, a year after World War II ended with a victory by the Allies, the Philippines were at last granted independence.

====Pre-Modern era====
Up until the 1960's, the Philippines were second only to Japan in terms of development in Asia. Two decades of rule by Ferdinand Marcos plunged the country into deep debt. Poverty was widespread and infrastructure for development was severely lacking. In 1986, the People Power uprising finally overthrew the Marcos government. (The EDSA Revolution - the majority of the demonstrations took place on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, EDSA.) He was replaced by '''Corazon Aquino''', widow of slain opposition leader, '''Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino''', Jr.

====Modern era====
Prior to the 21st century, corruption became one of the main problems of the country. The country suffered slightly in the 1997 Asian Financial crisis but led to a second EDSA which overthrew Pres. Joseph Estrada, the then Vice-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo (daughter of one of the former presidents) took his place. After her term ended in 2010, Benigno Aquino III (nicknamed "Noynoy" and "Pnoy"), son of Corazon and Benigno Aquino, Jr was elected President. Thankfully due to the hard work of the Filipinos and the Philippines being a suitable work environment for foreigners due to a large English speaking population, growth in the Philippines was fast and caught up with its neighbors.

===People===
[[Image:DSC01514.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Luneta Park]]
As of 2010, the Philippines has a population estimated at 93 million and growing very rapidly. From its long history of Western influence, 377 years by the Spaniards and 49 years by the Americans, its people have evolved as a unique blend of East and West in both appearance and culture. Filipinos are largely Austronesian (more specifically Malayo-Polynesian) in terms of ethnic origin. However, many people, particularly in the cities of Luzon and the Visayas, have [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese, [[India]]n, [[Spanish]] and [[United States|American]] mixtures, whereas those living in the provinces are mostly of pure Austronesian origin (known as "native"). Many Muslims in the Sulu archipelago near Borneo have [[Arabic|Arab]], Indian and Chinese mixtures. The four largest foreign minorities in the country are as follows: Chinese, [[Indian]], and the [[Japanese]]. Also of significance are the Americans, [[Indonesia]]ns, and Arabs. Pure Spaniards and other Europeans form a very small proportion in the country's population.

Needless to say, the characteristic Filipino traits are a confluence of many cultures put together. Filipinos are famous for the ''bayanihan'' or spirit of kinship and camaraderie taken from Austronesian forefathers. They observe very close family ties which is said to have been passed on by the Chinese. Religion comes from the Spaniards who were responsible for spreading the Christian faith across the archipelago. The Spaniards introduced Roman Catholicism and succeeded in converting the overwhelming majority of Filipinos. At least 83% of the total population belongs to their Roman Catholic faith. The Philippines is one of only two countries in Asia with a majority Roman Catholic population (the other being [[East Timor]])

The genuine and pure expression of hospitality is an inherent trait in Filipinos, especially those who reside in the countryside who may appear very shy at first, but have a generous spirit, as seen in their smiles. Hospitality, a trait displayed by every Filipino, makes these people legendary in Southeast Asia. Guests will often be treated like royalty in Philippine households. This is most evident during fiestas when even virtual strangers are welcomed and allowed to partake in the feast that most, if not all, households have during the occasion. At times, this hospitality is taken to a fault. Some households spend their entire savings on their fiesta offerings and sometimes even run into debt just to have lavish food on their table. They spend the next year paying for these debts and preparing for the next fiesta. At any rate, seldom can you find such hospitable people who enjoy the company of their visitors. Perhaps due to their long association with Spain, Filipinos are emotional and passionate about life in a way that seems more Latin than Asian.

Filipinos lead the bunch of English-proficient Asian people today and English is considered as a second language. When it was an American territory, English was largely taught to the Filipino people. While the official language is Filipino (which is basically the Tagalog language) and whereas 171 languages and dialects exist in this archipelago, English is the second most widely spoken language in the country. Many business establishments and schools also speak in English and many signs around the country are in English. American culture such as movies, television, music, electronic accessories and such are extremely popular in the country. 

The geographical and cultural grouping of Filipinos is defined by region, where each group has a set of distinct traits and langauges - the sturdy and frugal Ilocanos of the north, the industrious Tagalogs of the central plains, the loving and sweet Visayans from the central islands, and the colourful tribesmen and religious Muslims of Mindanao. Tribal communities or minorities are likewise scattered across the archipelago.
 
Also, it may seem peculiar for tourists to notice a somewhat latin flair in Filipino culture. About 3 million people, often the very oldest in the country, speak some Spanish. Mainstream Philippine culture, compared to the rest of Asia, is quite Hispanic and westernized at the surface level. But still, Filipinos are essentially Austronesian and many indigenous and pre-Hispanic attitudes and ways of thinking are still noticeable underneath an American veneer. Indigenous groups, who have retained a fully Malayo-Polynesian culture unaffected by Spanish influence, are also visible in cities like Manila, Baguio, Davao or Cebu, and can remind a visitor of the amazing diversity and multiculturalism present in the country.

===Politics===
The government of the Philippines was largely based on the [[United States]] model. The President of the Philippines is elected directly by the people, and serves as both the Head of State and Head of Government. 

The legislature is a bicameral congress consisting of a lower house, known as the ''Camara de Representantes'' (House of Representatives) and an upper house, known as the ''Senado'' (Senate). Both houses are elected directly by the people, though the country is divided into districts for the election of the lower house, while the upper house is elected by the country as a whole. Philippine elections are famously expensive and colourful spectacles and both the successful and unsuccessful politicos cripple the economy with corrupt practices designed to recoup their expenses for months if not years afterwards.

===Religion===
[[Image:DSC01435.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|San Agustin Church, Intramuros, [[Manila]]]]
The Philippines is not only the largest Christian country in Asia, but also it is the world's third largest Catholic Nation. The Catholic faith remains the single biggest legacy of three hundred years of Spanish colonial rule. Catholicism is taken quite seriously in the Philippines. Masses draw crowds from the biggest cathedrals in the metropolis to the smallest parish chapels in the countryside.  During Holy Week, most broadcast TV stations close down or operate only on limited hours and those that do operate broadcast religious programs.  The Christian faith exerts quite a bit of influence on non-religious affairs such as affairs of state. Mores have been changing slowly, however; artificial birth control, premarital sex, and the dissolution of marriage vows have been on the rise. 

The biggest religious minority are Muslim Filipinos who primarily live in Mindanao and ARMM, but also increasingly in cities such as Manila, Baguio or Cebu in the north and central parts of the country. They account for around 5% of the population. Islam is the oldest continually practised organized religion in the Philippines, with the first conversions made in the 12th century AD. Islam became such an important force that Manila at the time of the Spanish arrival in the 16th century was a Muslim city. Many aspects of this Islamic past are seen in certain cultural traits many mainstream Christian Filipinos still exhibit (such as eating and hygiene etiquette) and has added to the melting pot of Filipino culture in general. Sadly, Terrorist attacks and violent confrontations between the Filipino army and splinter militant Islamic organizations such as the Abu Sayyaf and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front have strained relations between Muslim and the non-Muslim Filipinos in rural areas in the south. Yet, the Muslim Filipinos are much more liberal in their interpretations of Islam, and like the Muslims of Indonesia, are generally more relaxed regarding such topics as gender-segregation or the hijab (veil) than South Asians or Middle Eastern Muslims.

Indian Filipinos, Chinese Filipinos, and Japanese Filipinos are mostly Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Shinto, and Taoist which all account 3% of the population of the Philippines. These populations have been in the country for centuries preceding Spanish rule, and many aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism are seen in the mainstream culture of Christian or Muslim Filipinos. As with many things in the Philippines, religion statistics are never clear-cut and defined, and many Christians and Muslims also practice and believe in indigenous spiritual aspects (such as honouring natural deities and ancestor-worship, as well as the existence of magic and healers) that may in some cases contradict the orthodox rules of their religions.

Atheists and Agnostics form a minority in the Philippines, around 0.8% of Filipinos are irreligious. However it is likely higher but unreported due to a high stigma against nonreligious people as well as it being illegal in many provinces.

===Climate===
The climate is tropical, with March to May (summer) being the hottest months. The rainy season starts in June and extends through October with strong typhoons possible. The coolest months are from November to February, with mid-January to end of February considered the best for cooler and dryer weather. Locations exposed directly to the Pacific Ocean have frequent rainfall all year. This includes the popular [[Pagsanjan]] Falls southeast of Manila (though the falls will get you wet regardless). The average temperatures range from 78°F / 25°C to 90°F / 32°C, and humidity is around 77 percent. [[Baguio]], which is branded as the summer capital of the Philippines, tends to be cooler due to its being located in mountainous regions with temperatures at night going below 20°C (68°F). During summer, the country experience droughts, sometimes at extreme conditions.

Typhoons frequently cause great destruction and loss of life.

===Holidays===
[[Image:Masskara_3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|MassKara Festival in Bacolod]]
{{infobox|Christmas: The Filipino Way|[[Image:Parol.jpg|center|thumb|220px|Parol]]

Go and have ''Noche Buena'' with a Filipino family; Filipinos don't mind strangers eating with them at their dining table as this is customary during ''Fiestas''

Try out ''Hamon'' (ham) and ''Keso De Bola''. Carolling is widely practiced by the youth around the Philippines, they'll appreciate if you give them at least ₱5-10. Don't miss the ''Misa Del Gallo''; Early Mass or ''Simbang Gabi'' in Tagalog meaning Night Mass, this tradition was passed down from the Spanish, masses usually are held either on Midnight or before dawn, after this Filipinos eat ''Kakanin'' or rice cakes and ''Bibingka'' that are sold outside churches and also drink ''Tsokolate''; hot chocolate or eat ''Champurado''; hot chocolate porridge. ''Parols''; Star of Bethlehem lanterns are hanged in front of houses, commercial establishments and streets, a Giant Lantern Festival is held in [[Pampanga]]. ''Belens'' or Nativities are displayed in city halls and commercial establishments. This is an experience not to be missed!}}

The Philippines is a multicultural country having Christian, Muslim and Chinese holidays aside from secular holidays. The year is welcomed by New Year's Day on January 1, being a predominantly Catholic country means observing the traditional Catholic holidays of '''Maundy Thursday''' and '''Good Friday''' during Lent or months around April or May, '''Araw ng pagkabuhay''' or '''Easter Sunday''' is celebrated 3 days after Good Friday. '''Araw ng Kagitingan''' or '''Day of Valor''', Boy scouts re-enact the march every 2 years in honor of this day that is also known as '''Bataan Day'''. The Bataan Death March was a 60&nbsp;km march and the people who participated in this march were captured, tortured and murdered. '''All Saints Day''' is on 1 November and '''All Souls Day''' on 2 November. In recognition of the Muslim Filipinos, the Islamic feast of '''Eid-Al-Fitr''' (known in the Philippines as ''Hari Raya Puasa''), held after Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting, is also a national holiday. This day changes year by year, as it follows the Lunar Calendar. '''Chinese New Year''' is also celebrated by the Chinese Community but dates vary according to the lunar calendar. Secular holidays include '''Labor Day''' (May 1) and '''Independence Day''' (June 12). August 30 is  declared '''National Heroes Day'''. Some holidays also commemorate national heroes such as '''Jose Rizal''' (Dec. 30) and '''Andres Bonifacio''' (Nov. 30) as well as '''Ninoy Aquino''' (August 21). Metro Manila is less congested during '''Holy Week''' as people tend to go to their hometowns to spend the holidays there. Holy week is also considered part of the super peak season for most beach resorts such as [[Boracay]] and the most popular ones tend to get overcrowded at this time. Due to its cool mountain weather, [[Baguio]] is also where a lot of people spend the Holy Week break. '''Christmas''' is widely celebrated on December 25.

===Culture===
The culture of the Philippines is very diverse. There is the native Melanesian and Austronesian culture, which is most evident in language, ethnicity, native architecture, food and dances. There is also some influence from Japan, China, India, Arabia, and Borneo. On top of that there is a heavy colonial Hispanic influence from Mexico and Spain, such as in religion, food, dance, language, festivals, architecture and ethnicity. Later influence from the US can also be seen in the culture.

Philippine laws and court decisions, with extremely rare exceptions, are written solely in US English.

===Books===
Filipino literature is a mix of Indian sagas, folktales, and traces of Western influence. Classical books are written in Spanish as well as in Tagalog, to this day most of Filipino literature is written in English.  The Philippines thus is a Multi-cultural country with its roots stretching from Asia to Europe and to the Americas.

===Cinema and music===
The Philippines have many talented actors and musicians. You will be surprised to discover that most of the Filipinos you will meet on your visit knows how to sing.

The Filipino film industry is suffering because of its main rival; the Western film industry, since the 21st century every year only 40 films are produced; down from 200-300 films a year in the 1990s.  Western culture has also permeated the music industry in the Philippines.  Many songs are in English.  American Rock-n-Roll and, recently, rap and hip-hop are heard and performed.  Traditional Filipino songs such as Kundiman (nostalgic/poetic songs) are still held dearly by the population but are, unfortunately, slowly losing influence among the younger generations.

===Address===
In the Philippines, ''Barangays'' which is somewhat the equivalent of a typical western '''sub-urban''', the term refers to the lowest government unit of administration. Barangay is abbreviated as ''Brgy.'' Although the word Barangay is conceived to have come from the word ''Balangay'' which is a term used to refer to a boatload of settlers in the old days in Mindanao, the term linguistically originated from the Spanish term ''Barrio'' commonly used in the [[Visayas]], which refers to a cluster of settlements in villages, until the term was legally adopted and used as a term in [[Philippine]] laws on local governments in the late 70s. A ''Barangay'' contains usually not less than 100 families. ''Barangays'' are then further divided into ''sitios'', a term used to refer to a community (sub-village) especially in rural areas where settlements are scattered in far flung communities. In urban cities, most barangays no longer have ''sitios'' but contiguous residential subdivisions or communities. Basically, every street address in the Philippines belongs to a barangay or two or more opposite ''barangays'' where boundaries are delineated by streets cutting across. By comparison, a ''barangay'' in urban cities is somewhat different from ''barangays'' in rural towns. A ''barangay'' in urban cities such as capital [[Manila]] and neighboring [[Quezon City]], could differ in terms of population density and territorial size when compared to ''barangays'' in  [[Paracelis, Mountain Province|Paracelis]], which is a rural town. Imagine Manila with a population of 1,660,714 living in 38.55 km2 distributed in 897 ''barangays'' compared to [[Quezon City]] with a population of 2,679,450 distributed in 142 ''barangays'' in 166.20 km2. as compared to [[Paracelis, Mountain Province|Paracelis]] with a population of 24,705 living in just 9 barangays over a land area of 553.25 km2. The biggest barangay in Paracelis is even bigger than the entire [[Manila]].

While getting a taxi or jeepney, Filipinos don't give the street's name, they give the address of a popular landmark instead which is near to their destination, so when you get a taxi or jeepney just give the popular landmark near your destination. In rural areas, it is not much harder to get to destinations since everybody almost knows everybody and you get to your destination by knowing the name of the ''barangay'', and then the ''sitio''.

==Regions==
The Philippines has 80 provinces categorized into 17 regions with over 120 cities. Our guide divides it into 3 major island groups:

==Cities==
<!-- NINE cities only to be listed here. Do not change without discussing on the talk page first. -->
With seven thousand islands, the Philippines has many cities.  Listed below are the '''nine''' most important cities for visitors, some of which are provincial capitals and centres of commerce and finance, as well as culture and history. 

*[[Manila]] - the national capital, is one of the most densely populated cities in the world - with all of that implies in terms of pollution, crime, urban poverty and traffic jams - with few parks. However, the smiling, stoical and resourceful people themselves are its saving grace, rather than the relatively few surviving monuments, historical landmarks and sights widely scattered around the city and its surrounding metropolitan area of [[Metro Manila]]!

*[[Iloilo City]] - is a tourist hub where the best restaurants, museums, hotels, shopping districts, and heritage sites in the city await. It is most known for the annual Dinagyang Festival. Apart from its own collection of tourist attractions, Iloilo serves as a gateway to [[Western Visayas]] region and a favored stopover for tourists heading to the beaches of [[Boracay]] and the nearby [[Guimaras]] , [[Antique]], [[Capiz]], [[Aklan]],[[Bacolod]] , and [[Negros Occidental]].


*[[Baguio]] - the country's summer capital because of its cool weather, it boasts well-maintained parks and scenic areas, as well as being the home of the "Igorot", the indigenous peoples of the Cordilleras.

*[[Cebu (city)|Cebu]] - It is the first city founded by the West in the Philippines and is a major center for commerce, industry, culture and tourism.

*[[Cagayan de Oro]] - known as the "City of Golden Friendship", it is popular for whitewater rafting and is the gateway to Northern Mindanao.

*[[Davao]] - one of the largest cities in the world in terms of land area, it is known for its durian and for being the home of [[Mount Apo]], the Philippines' tallest mountain.

*[[Tagbilaran]] - known as the site of the Sandugo (blood compact) between Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi and Rajah Sikatuna representing the people of [[Bohol]].

*[[Vigan]] - the capital of [[Ilocos Sur]] and a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]], its well-preserved city center is the finest example of Spanish colonial architecture in the Philippines. Declared as one of the new 7 wonders (cities)

*[[Zamboanga (city)|Zamboanga]]- known as "La Ciudad Latina de Asia" (Asia's Latin City), it is the melting pot between the Philippines' Christian and Muslim cultures, boasting old mosques, grand churches and historic colonial structures.

==Other destinations==
* [[Banaue]], home to the 2000 year old Rice terraces. People are fascinated at how the ''Igorots'' have made this, hence the Filipinos calling it as the 8th wonder of the world. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
* [[Batangas]], home to the birthplace of scuba diving in the Philippines boasting of world class dive sites and famous for its beaches. It's accessibility by land about 2 hours from the Manila airport makes it a popular destination. It is home to Taal Volcano and the Taal heritage town. 
* [[Boracay]] is 10km island featuring white sands.
* [[Camarines Sur]] has beautiful coral reefs, and shorelines of Black and white sands. Visit the Camarines Sur Watersport complex and go water skiing.
* [[Coron]] is the place for wreck diving in the Philippines.  Several Japanese ships were sunk here during World War II.  Other dive attractions include nice reefs, good macro life, and a very unique geothermal lake dive.  Island hopping is another popular activity here.
* [[El Nido]] is a coastal settlement and major tourist destination on the Philippines island of Palawan. El Nido comprises 45 islands and islets; limestone cliffs are also found here, which form a Karst backdrop similar to those found in Ha Long Bay, Krabi and Guilin. El Nido is a popular destination for locals during the long holidays of Holy Week but, until recently, has been relatively unknown to foreign tourists. Beaches, clear waters (away from the main town), jungle, steep limestone cliffs and stunning inlets make for beautiful seascapes.
* [[Donsol]] is the ''Whale Shark Capital'' of the world, dive and see whale sharks.
* [[Malapascua]] Island just like other islands in the Philippines, the island features a beautiful white sand shoreline and coral gardens.
* [[Palawan]] offers beautiful beaches that are often inhabited and waters which have coral reefs that are home to a large variety of fishes, not only coral reefs but also animals such as dugongs and manta rays.

{{infobox|''Beware'' of airlines usurping the role of Immigration Officers|''Technically'' you are supposed to have at least six months remaining on your passport on the date you are scheduled to leave the Philippines, even if you qualify for visa free entry. However, it's almost unheard of for Philippines Immigration Officers at ports of entry to actually enforce this requirement (unless fishing for a bribe); indeed alien children of returning ''balikbayan'' have been known to have been granted permission to stay for the usual 12 months when only 4 months remained at entry on their passports. 

However, since airlines are subject to heavy fines if one of their passengers are refused entry, many of them are far more vigilant in enforcement than the actual immigration officers! 
(This is known to be a particular problem when flying Cebu Pacific from Sydney to Manila, with a few passengers left behind in floods of tears on almost every flight.)}}
{{infobox|What to pay when leaving the Philippines?|When leaving the Philippines, departing passengers have to pay a ''passenger service charge'', more commonly known as the ''terminal fee''. This ₱550 fee is either already integrated into the ticket price (if departing from Manila), or is collected at other airports before entering immigration and is payable in Philippine pesos or US dollars. A stub is attached to your boarding pass to indicate that you have paid the fee.
In September 2018 the terminal fee at Cebu international airport is PHP 850. 

In addition, most Filipinos and resident aliens. (any one who stays more than one year) leaving the country are required to pay a ''travel tax'' of either ₱2,700 (around US$60) if flying first class or ₱1620 (around US$36) if flying in business or economy class. This tax is collected at a designated counter before check-in if the ticket was purchased outside the Philippines or, in most cases, on-line.  If the ticket was purchased at an airline ticket office or travel agency in the Philippines, the travel tax is most likely included in the ticket price; check first and ask before paying. Foreign nationals and ''balikbayans'' (former Filipino citizens) who are staying in the Philippines for less than one year are exempt from paying the travel tax, as are overseas Filipino workers, Filipino students studying abroad, infants of 2 years or less and employees of government or international agencies on official business. Reduced rates are available for minors (under 12 years), dependants (under 21 years) of Overseas Foreign Workers and journalists on assignment.}}

Nationals from the vast majority of countries, including all [[ASEAN]] countries, can enter the Philippines without a visa for up to 30 days, or obtain a visa on arrival for up to 59 days, as long as they have a return or onward ticket as well as passports valid for a period of at least six months beyond the period of stay. Exceptions to this rule are as listed below:

Nationals of [[Brazil]] and [[Israel]] may enter the Philippines visa-free for up to 59 days.

Nationals of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] - including permanent residents of Macau who hold Portuguese passports - may enter the Philippines visa-free for up to 14 days.

Those who hold British National (Overseas) passports may enter the Philippines visa-free for up to 7 days.

Nationals of [[China]] (PRC) traveling as tourists and holding a valid visa issued by Australia, Canada, Japan, the United States or a Schengen Area state may enter the Philippines visa-free for up to 7 days.

Nationals of [[India]] holding a valid tourist, business or resident visa issued by Australia, Canada, Japan, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the United States or a Schengen Area state may enter the Philippines visa-free for up to 14 days.

Nationals of [[Afghanistan]], [[Albania]], [[Algeria]], [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Belarus]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[China]] (PRC), [[Cuba]], [[East Timor]], [[Egypt]], [[Georgia]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kosovo]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Montenegro]], [[Nauru]], [[Nigeria]], [[North Korea]], [[Pakistan]], [[Palestine]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Serbia]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Sudan]], [[Syria]], [[Taiwan]], [[Tonga]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Yemen]] need to apply for a visa at a Filipino diplomatic mission prior to departure. 

If intending to stay beyond the duration of the 30-day visa, you may apply for a visa extension at the Bureau of Immigration (BI) which have offices in most main cities and at Manila and Cebu airports. Extensions are granted up to a maximum of six months per time. but only the (BI) offices in Manila, Cebu and Davao, can give give a 6 month visa extension. most BOI offices only give two months visa extensions. you can keep getting visa extensions up to a stay of (three years). after which foreign nationals wishing to stay longer must go out of the Philippines and then come back to start a new.
The 1st visa extension got within the Philippines at a BOI office is from 30 days up to 59 days and cost 2130 =$42.
you could also get a 59 day tourist visa from any Philippines Embassy around the world for $30/40. but you need to add on the costs of going to and from the Embassy two times as the visa take 2-3 working days to get.



If you overstay, you must pay on departure a fine of ₱1,000 per month of overstay plus a ₱2,020 processing fee. 

Airlines may refuse to let you check in if you only have a one-way ticket to the Philippines due to immigration requirements. Cebu Pacific Air will require a printed copy of an onwards "itinerary receipt" at check in. If you want to risk not having an onwards ticket, try to check in early to allow yourself time to buy a ticket at an Internet cafe or ticket desk in the airport if the airline refuses to check you in.

===By plane===
Because the Philippines is an archipelago, most visitors arrive by plane. International airports are located in [[Cebu City|Cebu]], [[Angeles#By_plane|Clark Freeport Zone, Angeles]], [[Davao]], [[Kalibo]], [[Laoag City|Laoag]], [[Iloilo]], [[Manila]] and [[Zamboanga]]. 

A much more congenial airport to arrive at is 
[[Cebu_(city)#By_plane|'''Mactan-Cebu International Airport''']] or [http://www.kalibointernationalairport.com Kalibo International Airport] , which are both at the centre of the Philippine archipelago and outside the Typhoon belt.

Passengers departing the Philippines from Cebu, Clark, Iloilo, Kalibo or Davao airports have to pay a International terminal fee. Clark has a terminal fee of ₱600. Cebu has a terminal fee of 750. Davao, Iloilo, Kalibo have a terminal fee of 700. it is paid before entering the immigration and pre-departure "air-side" area of the terminals.  

[[Philippine Airlines|Philippine Airlines (PAL)]] [http://www.philippineairlines.com], Cebu Pacific [http://www.cebupacificair.com], Air Asia [http://www.airasia.com] are the national carriers. 

If you plan to travel around the various islands, it is best to get an open jaw ticket.  This can save much time back-tracking.  Most common open-jaw ticket combinations fly into Manila and out of Cebu.  Local airlines also have regular "seat sales", advertising cheap fares for flights to domestic destinations.  However, be aware of travel dates: some tickets booked during a seat sale may only be used on dates well after the duration of the sale (sometimes up to a year after the sale), and advertised fares usually exclude government taxes and fuel surcharges. Also, be informed that Cebu Pacific is notorious for flight delays almost on a daily basis and short notice flight cancelations. Cebu Pacific also don't provide passengers with free food or refreshments, accommodation or reimbursement of full airfare cost during flight delays.

If you live in an area with a large Filipino population (such as London, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taipei or Tokyo), check out travel agencies catering to overseas Filipinos which often have fares keener than those generally advertised.

====Ninoy Aquino International Airport====
'''Ninoy Aquino International Airport''' (NAIA) [http://www.miaa.gov.ph] ({{IATA|MNL}} | {{ICAO|RPLL}} is divided into four terminals: Terminals 1, 2, 3 and the Domestic Terminal (also known as Terminal 4). All airlines use Terminal 1 or 3 with a few exceptions: Philippine Airlines uses Terminal 2, and Air Asia domestic flights use the Domestic Terminal.  

Terminal 1, long regarded as one of Asia's worst airport terminals, is currently undergoing renovation and several areas of the terminal have been renovated.  The newer Terminals 2 and 3 are regarded as being far nicer than Terminal 1, with more amenities to boot.

=====Transit=====
NAIA is famously known for being difficult to transit through, especially if your flight leaves from a different terminal and is a national embarrassment. However, airport shuttle buses now transport passengers between terminals. The shuttle is '''free''' and runs every fifteen minutes. Shuttle buses depart from the arrival area of all terminals and use main airport access roads, so make sure you have a visa if you require one to enter or transit the Philippines as you will be entering the Philippines if you will be connecting onto a flight departing from another terminal.

Passengers who are connecting to an Philippine Airlines flight and vice-versa may avail of a free airside shuttle service between Terminals 2 and 3.

If your flight departs from the same terminal, transfer counters are available before immigration at all terminals.  Passengers who transit through Manila and do not transfer terminals do not need to undergo entry procedures and are exempt from paying the terminal fee.

Beware of ''laglag bala'', a modus operandi of syndicate/s operating in Philippine airports where bullets are planted into your luggage/s to extort money from travellers, locals and foreigners alike.

=====NAIA transport=====
There are no monorails connecting NAIA's 3 terminals. NAIA is accessible by bus, taxi, train, jeepney and shuttle bus. If you have a connecting flight, make sure you allocate some time to shuttle from one terminal to another.

*'''Taxi''': Yellow airport taxis have a stand at the arrival area of all terminals.  The flag down rate is ₱70, with an additional ₱4.00 surcharge for every 250 meters.  At Terminal 3, you can hail a white city taxi from the departure area: just take the escalator or elevator up to the departures hall and exit to the departure ramp.  Coupon taxis are special taxis with fixed rates according to the destination: inquire at the information desk for rates. Taxis taken from the airport are usually a lot more expensive than those hailed outside. If money is more important to you than time, walk to a public road and hail one there instead (and make sure they know where you want to go and that they will use a meter before you get in). Application based hailing taxi's such '''Grab Taxi''' and '''Uber''' are also available and a more convenient and safer option.

*'''Bus''': Four city bus routes connect Terminals 1 and 2 with the rest of Metro Manila: Grotto-NAIA, NAIA-Malanday, Bagong Silang-NAIA and NAIA-Lagro.  There are also two city bus routes between the airport and [[Bulacan]]: NAIA-San Jose del Monte and Norzagaray-Sapang Palay-NAIA.  These buses have a "MIA/6-11/Tambo" signboard posted on the dashboard, and generally serve points along Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) and Commonwealth Avenue.  Fares usually start at ₱10.

*'''Train''': The airport is served by two train stations: Baclaran LRT station near the Domestic Terminal, and Nichols railway (PNR) station near Terminal 3.  Both stations however are 2-3 kilometers away from the airport proper.  Jeeps which serve Terminal 3 and Villamor Airbase stop near Nichols station.

*'''Shuttle bus''': A shuttle bus connects Terminal 3 to the Taft Avenue MRT station.  The fare is ₱20 and departs every 15 minutes.

*'''Jeepney''': Jeepneys which serve Terminal 3 will have "NAIA Terminal 3" or something similar written on the side route panel.  Jeepneys which serve Terminals 1 and 2 will have "MIA" written on the route panel.

*'''Hotel transportation''': Major hotel representatives are available on arrival and have chauffeur services which you can book on advance.  The cost is around ₱750-₱950.

====Other airports====
Some visitors who enter the Philippines choose to avoid flying through Manila, instead using other airports throughout the country which have international flights.

* '''Diosdado Macapagal (Clark) International Airport''' [http://www.dmia.ph] ({{IATA|CRK}} | {{ICAO|RPLC}}) in [[Angeles City]], [[Pampanga]] is 85km north of Manila. AirAsia [http://www.airasia.com/] (flies from Kuala Lumpur. and Jin Air [http://www.jinair.com] (Seoul) are foreign low-cost carriers serving Clark. Cebu Pacific treats Clark as a hub, with flights to Hong Kong, Singapore and Macau. Scoot air [http://www.tigerairways.com/] flies to Clark from Singapore. The legacy carriers which fly to Clark are Asiana Airlines, flying to Seoul and Emirates, which serves Dubai. and Qatar airways.

* '''Mactan-Cebu International Airport''' [http://www.mactan-cebuairport.com.ph] ({{IATA|CEB}} | {{ICAO|RPVM}}) in [[Cebu]] is the Philippines' second-busiest airport and a major hub for visitors headed to points in the Visayas and Mindanao.  Several of the airlines which serve Manila also serve Cebu. Low cost airlines Air Aisa from KL, Scoot airways from Singapore, Cebu Pacific from Singapore, Hongkong and Taiwan fly to Cebu. SilkAir (part of Singapore airlines), Emirates, Cathay pacific, Korean Air, Eva Air, Asiana airlines, Xiamen Air also fly to Cebu.

* '''Francisco Bangoy International Airport''' ({{IATA|DVO}} | {{ICAO|RPMD}}) in [[Davao]] is served by SilkAir [http://www.silkair.com] and Cebu pacific with daily flights to and from Singapore. Air Asia also fly nonstop from Davao to [[Kuala Lumpur]].

* '''Kalibo International Airport''' ({{IATA|KLO}} | {{ICAO|RPVK}}) in [[Kalibo]], [[Aklan]] (near [[Boracay]]) is a Air Asia hub, with flights to KL, Seoul, Shanghai and Taipei.  Other airlines also have scheduled charter flights to Kalibo from points in South Korea, China and Taiwan.

*'''Laoag International Airport''' ({{IATA|LAO}} | {{ICAO|RPLI}}) in [[Laoag]], [[Ilocos Norte]] is served by Air Macau [http://www.airmacau.com.mo] with regular charter flights to Macau.

* '''Iloilo International Airport''' ({{IATA|ILO}} | {{ICAO|RPVI}}) in [[Iloilo (city)|Iloilo]] is served by Cebu Pacific, with flights to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]].

===By boat===
'''Aleson Shipping lines''' operates a regular ferry service which connects [[Zamboanga City]] with [[Sandakan]] in [[Malaysia]]. the ferry departs Zamboanga every Tuesday and Friday at 17.00 pm and a one ticket cost around $65.

==Get around==

===By plane===
Since the Philippines is an archipelago, the easiest way to move between islands is by plane. Philippine Airlines (including sister carrier PAL Express), Cebu Pacific have significant domestic operations, linking many major towns and cities with Manila and Cebu, while Air Asia also serve secondary destinations.  There are also several smaller carriers which serve resort destinations (such as Amanpulo in [[Palawan]]), as well as more remote destinations.  While larger cities are served by jet aircraft, many destinations and less busy routes are served by propeller-driven planes.

Unlike most other countries, the terminal building is reserved only for passengers (as well as airport and airline staff). In order to enter, you need to present a print-out of the flight reservation. Security screening may be performed at the entrance to the terminal in addition to after check-in.  

The route networks of most local airlines are heavily centered around Manila, Clark and Cebu: flying between two domestic points usually entails having to transit through at least one of these airports, and there are few direct flights between other major cities.  Reaching Sulu and Tawi-Tawi by air is a special case: travelers must fly through [[Zamboanga City]].

A significant majority of domestic flights in the Philippines are operated by low-cost carriers and are consequently economy-only: PAL is the only airline to offer business class on domestic flights.  This does not mean however that fares are affordable: domestic seat sales are a common feature throughout the year, and all major airlines regularly offer promo fares on their websites.  However, fares increase significantly during major peak travel seasons (particularly during Christmas, Holy Week and the last two weeks of October), and in places served by only one airline (such as [[Vigan]] or [[Marinduque]]), fares also increase during major provincial or town fiestas.  Flights are frequently full during peak travel season, so it is advisable to book well in advance.

Passengers departing on domestic flights must pay a terminal fee prior to entering the pre-departure area, although the fee will be integrated into the ticket price starting August 1, 2012 (tickets issued before that date do not include the terminal fee and the fee must be paid at the airport).  Fees vary, with most major cities charging ₱200, and smaller cities charging between ₱30 and ₱100.  Fees are only payable in Philippine pesos except in Manila and Cebu, where U.S. dollars are accepted.

===By train===
The '''Philippine National Railways''' (PNR) [http://www.pnr.gov.ph/] currently operates two overnight intercity services: the '''Bicol Express''' between Manila and [[Naga]], [[Camarines Sur]], which resumed on June 29, 2011 after a five-year absence, and the '''Mayon Limited''' between Manila and Ligao in [[Albay]].  Additional services are expected in the future as the rehabilitation of the PNR network progresses.  Train service is comparable to (or slower than, due to delays) buses in terms of speed, but is more comfortable owing to the use of donated Japanese coaches for the service.

The Bicol Express and Mayon Limited are '''NOT''' non-stop services: from Tutuban, Manila's main train station, the train calls at several points in [[Metro Manila]], [[Laguna]], [[Quezon]] and Camarines Sur before arriving in Naga (and Albay before arriving in Ligao for the Mayon Limited).  It is possible to travel between any two points served by the services, and fares are distance-based.  Children under three feet may travel for free.

There are currently four classes of service on the Bicol Express:

*'''Executive sleeper class''' features individual air-conditioned cabins.  Each cabin has a bed, pull-down armrests so that a portion of the bed can be used as a chair, and a small table.  Washrooms are available inside the coach.
*'''Family sleeper class''' features four-bed air-conditioned cabins: two beds on each side, with one stacked on top of the other.  Access to the top bunk is via a foldable ladder between both sides of the cabin, and cabins are separated from the aisle with a curtain.  The PNR promotes this class for the use of families traveling together, although it is possible to book an individual bed.
*'''Reclining air-conditioned economy class''' (or '''deluxe class''') features air-conditioned reclining chairs, two on each side of the cabin.  On some coaches, it is possible to rotate the chairs so that passengers may face each other.
*'''Economy class''' (or '''ordinary class''') is the cheapest class of service, featuring upholstered benches on each side which can sit up to three people.  Ventilation is provided via overhead ceiling fans.

On the Mayon Limited, only reclining air-conditioned economy class ("deluxe") and regular economy class are offered.  However, unlike the Bicol Express, the Mayon Limited provides service using two different trains: the "deluxe" service operates on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while the "economy" service operates on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.

Passengers on PNR intercity services are entitled to a free baggage allowance of 20 kilograms.

It is possible to pre-book seats on intercity trains by calling the PNR at +63 (2) 319-0044.  Pre-booking seats is recommended during peak travel seasons (especially during Holy Week and in September, during the Peñafrancia Festival in Naga), where trains can be full.  However, the PNR does send a second, all-economy supplementary overnight train on certain days during peak season if traffic demand warrants it.  Timetables and fares for all services, including supplementary services, are announced on the PNR's website and also on its official Facebook profile [http://www.facebook.com/pnrailways].

The PNR also operates the '''Commuter Express''' in Metro Manila, a once-daily commuter service between Manila and [[Biñan]], Laguna (which is also part of the Commuter Express, but uses different trains), and the '''Bicol Commuter''' between Naga and towns in Camarines Sur and [[Albay]].

===By car===
The Philippines' road network is centered on Manila.  Outside Luzon, larger islands' road networks converge on the largest city or cities (for example, [[Cebu City]] for [[Cebu]], [[Iloilo (city)|Iloilo City]] for Panay and [[Puerto Princesa]] for [[Palawan]]), while smaller islands (such as [[Marinduque]], [[Catanduanes]] and [[Camiguin]]) usually have a road circling the entire island.  The Philippines has one highway which is part of the Asian Highway Network: the Pan-Philippine Highway (AH26), also known locally as the '''Maharlika Highway'''.  The highway begins in [[Laoag]] and ends in [[Zamboanga (city)|Zamboanga City]], traversing through Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao.  However, it is also the only highway in the Asian Highway Network which is not connected to any other highway: it is not possible to enter the Philippines by car.

Roads in the Philippines vary greatly in quality from the paved multi-lane expressways of Luzon to the narrow dirt roads of remote mountain areas, which may complicate travel by car.  Most major roads have two lanes and are normally paved with asphalt or concrete, although multi-lane roads are common near major cities.  Road atlases and maps are available at bookstores throughout the country, and are very helpful when driving, especially when driving alone.

Major international car rental companies such as Hertz [http://www.hertzphilippines.com] and Budget [http://www.budget.com.ph/] have offices in Metro Manila, notably at the airport.  Avis [http://www.avis.com.ph/] and Europcar [http://www.europcar.com/car-PHILIPPINES.html] are among the largest international car rental companies, with offices in several cities throughout the Philippines.  There are also local car rental companies, such as Nissan Rent-a-Car [http://www.nissanrentacar.com] and Altcatcars [http://www.alcatcars.com].  Regardless of the company, prices are bound to be reasonable.

Car rental companies usually allow either self-drive or chauffeur-driven rentals: some types of cars however (like vans) may only be rented out with a chauffeur.  Also, some rental companies (mostly local ones) may only allow rentals to be driven within the island where the city of rental is located: for example, it may be possible to drive with a rental from Manila to Legazpi (both on Luzon), but not from Manila (Luzon) to [[Tacloban]] (Leyte) because it would entail the use of roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) ferries.  If you intend to drive out of Luzon and into the outlying islands, the Visayas or Mindanao (and/or vice-versa), be sure that the rental company's terms and conditions allow it.

====Road networks====
In addition to the existing network of national and local roads, the Philippines has two additional road networks: an expressway network and the Strong Republic Nautical Highway (SRNH) system.

Luzon has an expressway network dominated by the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX). These are tollways with good paved roads, are privately-maintained, and the farthest tolls will not cost more than a few dollars from Metro Manila.  Other expressways include the Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway (a 94-kilometer 4-lane freeway connecting [[Subic Bay]] and [[Tarlac]]) and the [[Bataan]] Provincial Expressway.  Expressways are connected to the network of national highways and provincial roads which connect to major cities and provinces.

The Strong Republic Nautical Highway system is a three-route network of national and provincial roads, bridges and roll-on/roll-off (RO/RO) ferries which facilitate the connection of major islands of the Philippines together by road, bringing down the cost of driving (and, ultimately, lowering the cost of shipping goods between islands).  The SRNH system begins in Luzon and run in a north-south direction through the Visayas and ultimately end in Mindanao.  The SRNH is useful for driving to tourist destinations outside Manila: for example, it is possible to drive to both [[Puerto Galera]] and [[Boracay]] from Manila via the Western Nautical Highway.  SRNH routes are signposted and a map of the network and RO/RO schedules are available from the Department of Tourism [http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=Strong%20Republic%20Nautical%20Highway&func=all&pid=2718&tbl=1].

====Driving====
International driving licences are valid in the Philippines for up to 30 days after arrival, after which an International Driver's Permit or a Philippine driving licences are required.  Vehicular traffic in the Philippines moves on the right, and the vast majority of road signs are in English.  Most signs conform to design guidelines used in the United States but all units used are metric. Filipinos mainly use manual transmission in their cars; however, if you're visiting the Philippines, and you're used to driving an automatic transmission, automatic transmission is available for rental cars, though, it's typically more expensive. 

Filipinos are famous for their driving habits (or lack thereof).  Traffic often grinds to a screeching halt, especially in major cities (Metro Manila in particular), and the honking of horns is a very common occurrence.  When there is no traffic, speeding, swerving and reckless passing happen on a regular basis, especially on desolate rural roads.  Car traffic competes with bus and jeepney traffic, which jostle sidewalk curbs to get more passengers, especially in areas without designated bus stops: the fact that bus and jeepney drivers' salaries are determined based on passenger load does not help the traffic situation in many cities.  Motorcycles frequently weave through traffic, increasing the risk of accidents.  However, traffic lights, while frequently ignored in the past, are more strictly adhered to now.  Seatbelts are mandatory only for persons seating in the front seat.

Due to heavy traffic congestion, Metro Manila and [[Baguio]] have laws that restrict certain vehicles based on the day of the week and the ending number of your vehicle's license plate: this is officially called the Uniform Vehicular Volume Reduction Program (UVVRP), but it is simply known as "number coding" or, previously "color coding" (although it has nothing to do with the color of your vehicle).  The UVVRP works as follows:

{|center border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center"
|+'''Number Coding'''
!Day !!Plate number
|-
|Monday ||1, 2
|-
|Tuesday ||3, 4
|-
|Wednesday ||5, 6
|-
|Thursday ||7, 8
|-
|Friday ||9, 0
|-
|Weekends and Holidays ||No coding
|}

Cities that enforce the UVVRP prohibit cars from being driven between 7:00 am and 7:00 pm on a certain weekday on most national (primary) and secondary roads, although the implementation varies: in Metro Manila (excluding [[Makati]] and [[Pasay]]), a "window" exists between 10:00 am and 3:00 pm where the scheme is not enforced, while in Baguio, the UVVRP is only enforced in the city center, and the scheme does not apply to the rest of the city.  In general however, the UVVRP does not apply to minor streets (mostly in residential areas), and those roads remain open to coded cars the whole day.  Be sure to check with a local contact or the car rental agency/hotel concierge about whether these rules will apply to your vehicle, especially as foreigners driving can become targets for less scrupulous traffic aides.

===By taxi===
{{infobox|Taxi fares|
Most of the taxi drivers nowadays charge people with fares not based on the meters, especially during peak hours.  If you encounter this say "no" and say that drivers don't have a right to give you a fare that is double and not based on the meters, this is usually encountered by tourists as well as middle class-elite class Filipinos. If this happens get out of the taxi, threaten the driver you will call the police hotline;'''Philippine National Police'''[http://www.pnp.gov.ph] (PNP) tel:(+632)722-0650  start dialing your cellphone to make him believe you are calling the police or either call the '''MMDA[http://www.mmda.gov.ph]'''(Metro Manila Development Authority) hotline; '''136''' if you're within Manila, you can also text the police at 2920 and your message must be as follows; PNP(space)(message), for your complaints. In 2009, some taxis have installed meters which give out receipts, ask for a receipt if they have one.
}}

Taxis are generally available within the major cities but are usually not used for travel across the various provinces and regions. Some FX (shared taxis), however, usually ply provincial routes. You can also call reputable Taxi companies that can arrange pickups and transfers as well as airport runs. 

When hailing a taxi in the cities, ensure the meter is on and pay the metered fare. A tip of 10 pesos is acceptable. Also, make sure you have small denomination banknotes, as the drivers often claim not to have change in an effort to obtain a larger tip! Please do have coins ready with you. Moreover, don't be surprised if drivers want to bypass the meter during rush hour. (Updated April 2011) Most taxis have the flag down rate of ₱40 with each 300 meters cost ₱3.50 while Yellow cab taxis are more expensive with a flag down rate of ₱70 with each 300 meters cost ₱4.00.

Application based hailing taxi's such '''Grab Taxi''' and '''Uber''' are becoming more popular and more convenient and safer option. These application can accept cash or credit/debit option.

===By bus===

Provincial bus companies have scheduled trips from Manila to provinces to the north and south. Major provincial bus companies include ALPS The Bus, Inc.[http://www.alpsthebus.com], Victory Liner[http://www.victoryliner.com/], Philtranco[http://www.philtranco.com.ph/]

====Inter-island trips====
Next to buses and some times low cost airlines, ships are the cheapest modes of transports when getting around the country. fares can be as low as ₱1,000 but some times as high as 3000. from Manila to Iloilo, Bacolod, Cebu, Butuan, Cagayan de oro, Iligan, Ozamiz or Dipolog a trip can last a day or two '''2GO''' operate interisland ferries out of Manila. There is 2 Go Ferry which has convenient overnight ferry trips to [[Coron]], [[Palawan]].  2 Go Ferry operates between Manila and Coron, Puerto Princesa several days of the week.

[http://www.oceanjet.net/ '''Oceanjet'''] is a reliable company offering fast ferries throughout the Visayas at affordable prices - except for taking small scooters or motorcycles where their prices are outrageously expensive. Schedule Information is difficult to obtain - newspapers often contain pages with ads on certain days, but, believe it or not, most people rely on word-of-mouth.

===Cruises===

'''Sun Cruises''' [http://www.corregidorphilippines.com/] has tour packages to Corregidor Island in Manila Bay. Prices range from ₱2,000 for a day tour with a buffet lunch, to ₱3,000 for an overnight stay at the island. The tour guides are very informative, and the island is steeped in history, particularly about the battles that raged there during World War 2. They also offer cruises around Manila Bay.

===By jeep and rickshaws=== 
[[Image:PH-Manila-Jeepneys.jpg|right|250px|Jeepneys]]
Jeepneys are the most known transportation to all Filipinos. They are the most affordable transport in the Philippines. Costing about ₱7 per 4 km and additional ₱1 per km, they are by far the most affordable way to get around most major urban areas.. They stop if you wave at them. The jeepney is  remnants of the Jeep used by the American troops during World War II, the innovative Filipinos modified the jeep (by lengthening the body and adding horizontal seats) to seat as many as 20 people (10 per side). Within Manila, you will find multiple Jeepneys per route, for added convenience.  In the provinces, Jeepneys also connect towns and cities. For longer distances, however, buses are more comfortable. 

Also worthy of mention are the '''''traysikels''''' and the '''pedicabs''' or in other words '''Rickshaw'''; however, this may not be to the liking of most foreigners, as these are cramped and quite open to traffic. These means of transport are  usually used for very short distances. Traysikels are different from Pedicabs; they are motorized while pedicabs are manually used with the help of bicycles. Fares range from ₱7 or even higher, depending on the distance of your destination.

The Philippines has two official languages: English and [[Filipino phrasebook|Filipino]]. Filipino is mainly based on the Tagalog language (a relative of Malay). It has also been influenced by English, [[Spanish]], [[Malay]], [[Indonesian]], [[Hindi]], [[Arabic]], [[Chinese]] and many other languages mostly from the Indian subcontinent and Europe. While Filipino is an Austronesian language like Malay, Indonesian and Javanese, the language has been heavily influenced by several other languages through trade with other countries and during the Spanish colonial times, and to this day the language is dominated by Spanish loanwords which is helpful for some Spanish people and which is also the reason why some Filipinos understand a little Spanish. In addition, as Malay and Filipino are closely related, speakers of Malay would also recognise many cognates in the Filipino language. Generally, somebody who speaks Malay and Spanish would be able to understand the conversations of locals to a certain extent, and might just be able to get by.

Filipino is the language spoken in the Central Luzon and Southern Tagalog regions as well as the National Capital Region (NCR) or Metro Manila. In the Northern Luzon provinces, [[Ilocano phrasebook|Ilocano]] is the  most common language spoken while [[Kapampangan]] is widespread in Central Luzon. Further south of Metro Manila lies the Bicol Region where [[Bicolano]] is used. In the Southern Islands of Visayas and Mindanao, [[Cebuano phrasebook|Cebuano]] is the most common language spoken. Other languages in the south include [[Hiligaynon]] and [[Waray phrasebook|Waray]].  

'''English''' is an official language of the Philippines and is a compulsory subject in all schools, so it is widely spoken in the larger cities and main tourist areas. However, it is usually not the first language of locals. English, though, is in widespread use as many signs are printed in English and there are even 3 TV channels using it on a full-time basis. Almost all broadsheet newspapers use English as well. Tourists won't have any problems using English when making inquiries at commercial and government establishments. A few simple phrases in Filipino will come in handy when traveling to rural places as English proficiency is limited there. ''Taglish'', which involves code switching between Tagalog and English, is spoken nowadays by some urban youths,  Below is an example:

:'''Taglish''':''Kumusta ka?'' ''Ok naman ako.''<br/>
:'''English''':''How are you?'' ''I'm ok.''<br/>

Spanish is no longer widely understood, though many Spanish words survive in the local languages. A Spanish based Creole language known as '''Chavacano''' is spoken in Cavite and in Zamboanga. The government is trying to revive Spanish by providing Spanish in public schools as an optional language. Younger Spanish-Filipinos tend to speak Filipino languages and/or English as their primary language, however there are around 3 million people who speak Spanish plus there is daily radio programme "Filipinas Ahora Mismo" which broadcasts from Manila in Spanish.

There are some other ethnic groups who reside in the country, particularly in more urbanized areas like Manila.  The largest group is the Chinese, many of whom have assimilated with Filipino society.  Take note however that since most of them come from Fujian province, they speak [[Minnan phrasebook|Hokkien]] (rather than Mandarin), but they are also taught Mandarin in Chinese schools. Muslim Filipinos are taught [[Arabic phrasebook|Arabic]] in schools to read the Qu'ran. Other groups include the Indians, Japanese, Arabs, Koreans, Americans and Europeans use their native language as their first language. In some cosmopolitan areas, there are establishments catering to Korean speakers. Indian languages such as [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi]] are also spoken by the Indian communities while Europeans speak their own languages.

Contrary to modern warfare, which is brute force intensive, Arnis is a process of cohesive physics--using your opponents energy as your own. Taught by priests and mystics, this ancient form of engagement was passed down through the generations.  Arnis has become quite popular in modern culture, particularly in cinematography.  From Enter the Dragon (1973 to Taken (2008) professional choreographers, trained in the arts of Arnis, depict the swift and deadly movements of this ancient technique.  According to the Republic Act No. 9850, as of December 11,2009, the Congress of the Philippines declares Arnis as the national sport and martial art of the nation.  Because of this law, Arnis is a pre-requisite of most P.E. classes in college.

==Work==

Under Philippine law, any foreigner working must have an Alien Employment Permit issued by the Department of Labor. The paperwork is in general handled by the prospective employer and the employee picks up the relevant visa at a Philippine Embassy or Consulate.  Working without a permit is not allowed and does not give you any labor protections.  Furthermore, visas are checked upon departing the Philippines.  Those who have overstayed without permission are subject to fines and, in certain cases, even jail. 

It is possible for foreigners to earn casual money while staying in the Philippines, especially in Manila and other bigger cities in provinces. These may include temporary teaching in schools, colleges and other institutions; and working in bars and clubs. Temporary work may also be available as an "extra" on the set of a film or television series. Fluency in English is very important in jobs while knowledge of Filipino or Tagalog is considerably low. Recently as of late 2010, the Philippines has overtaken India in the call center industry, and many international companies hire English fluent workers.

Most establishments pay monthly but informal jobs pay out variably either cash on hand or weekly.

The Philippine '''peso''', symbolised locally and throughout our Philippines guides as ₱ and internationally as '''PHP''' is the official currency and in almost all cases the only currency recognised for normal transactions. The only other currency that would be recognised in rare cases would be the US dollar, which is typically used in duty free outlets, internet transactions and overseas travel products sold in the Philippines.   

Peso bills come in denominations of 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000. One peso is equivalent to 100 centavos and coins come in 5, 10 and 25 centavo variants in addition to the 1, 5 and 10 peso coins.  There are 2 versions of each bill with the newer version in circulation since December 2010 (albeit it is still rare to have them).  The newer notes have similar colours to their old counterparts, have the same people at the front (Except for the 500-peso note which also features former President Aquino) but rather than historical sites at the back, these newer notes feature Filipino natural wonders and species unique to the country.

'''UPDATE - Do not accept ANY of the older version (pre-December 2010) banknotes. They are now worthless.'''

Money changers are not so common in the Philippines outside some heavily touristed areas. A rule of thumb: the more currency you wish to exchange, the more favourable the rates can be. Banks on the other hand are widely available to exchange currency but usually impose a minimum amount (usually around US$100) and have limited hours of operation, usually 09:00-15:00 on weekdays.  
The notable exceptions are[http://www.bpi.com.ph/ Bank of the Philippine Islands] (BPI) and [http://www.bdo.com.ph/ Banco De Oro] (BDO) which have longer hours of operation. Don't exchange money in stalls along the streets as some of them might be exchanging your money for counterfeit money, contact [http://www.bsp.gov.ph/ Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas] (Central Bank of the Philippines) if you suspect the money you've been given to be counterfeit. Money changers do exist at department stores, supermarkets and hotels but needless to say the rates are highly unfavourable to the customers and some will only exchange into ₱.  If you need to change back into foreign currency, you need to fill-out paperwork and can only exchange in certain denominations (usually $100, €100, £100).    

Be aware that no person is allowed to enter or leave the Philippines carrying more than ₱50,000 (since september 2016) of coins and banknotes without prior authorisation by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. Those who have not gained prior authorisation will have to declare the excess money at the customs desk. However bringing-in any amount in foreign currency is legal but anything in excess of USD10,000 (or its equivalent) must be declared.

===ATMs and credit cards===
Visitors can also use the 6,000 ATMs nationwide to withdraw funds or ask for cash advances. The three major local ATM consortia are ''BancNet'', ''MegaLink'' and ''Expressnet''. International networks, like ''PLUS'' and ''Cirrus'', are accessible with many ATMs, however Cirrus is more predominant than PLUS; however, withdrawals are limited to 10,000 pesos. only the HSBC ATMs in Manila. Cebu and Davao let you take up to P40,000 per transaction without a 200-250 fee. Visitors who have a ''MasterCard''/''Maestro''/''Cirrus'' cards can withdraw funds or ask for cash advances at ATMs that display their logos.  The most prominent MasterCard ATMs are the Express Tellers by BPI (Bank of the Philippine Islands) and the Smartellers by Banco de Oro. PLUS ATMs are not available locally as a complement by itself, but instead it is available along with Cirrus.  Prominent examples include the Fasteller by BDO Bank and the Electronic Teller (ET) by Metrobank.  Most MegaLink ATMs are linked to PLUS and Cirrus.

Credit (and debit) card holders can use VISA, MasterCard, American Express and JCB cards in many commercial locations in the Philippines but merchants would usually require a minimum purchase amount before you can use your card.  Cardholders of China UnionPay credit cards can get cash advances at many BancNet ATMs (particularly of Metrobank) but cannot use their cards in point of sale transactions at the moment.  Most credit card machines in stores are capable of reading chip-and-pin cards and you should be to enter your PIN to process a transaction just as you do in your home country.  However because entering a PIN is not yet a norm in most locally-issued credit cards, merchants may nonetheless also require your signature on the transaction slip.  Credit cards are generally not accepted for government-related transactions.

In 2010, Philippine banks started to charge ₱200 per transaction for using foreign cards in their ATM machines, in addition to cash withdrawal and exchange fees already imposed by your bank. Notable exception is HSBC [http://www.hsbc.com.ph/1/2/contactus/branchatm], which does not charge (September 2017) this fee; however, their ATMs are available only in a larger cities Manila, Cebu, and Davao. Considering small transaction limits in many ATMs, this fee easily adds 2-4% to the amount withdrawn - thus, bringing in cash and exchanging it to peso in the bank generally will be cheaper (please be aware though of customs regulations). Check your home bank to see if special arrangements exist to lower withdrawal fees imposed by foreign banks.

===Costs===
Traveling in Philippines is '''cheap''' (one of the least expensive places to visit in Asia and as well in the rest of the world.) For example a stay in a Double Fan room with own bathroom and cable TV in a Lodge or Pension house or Tourist inn could cost as low as $10 a night. a A.c double room with own bathroom and Cable TV can cost as low as $15 a night. a flight to Cebu from Manila and vice-versa can cost as low as $25 or ₱1175. or a flight from Manila to Davao and vice-versa can cost as low as $40. Transportation is low as ₱7.00 for the first 4km in a ''Jeepney''. a bus ride in a A.c bus cost about 1.5 per km. 20% less for non A.c buses. Using the internet for 1 hour in an internet cafe range from ₱10 to ₱20 depending on the Internet Cafe's location, a can of coke costs as low was ₱20 while a copy of the ''International Herald Tribune'' costs ₱70 and ''Economist'' as low as ₱160. In most restaurants.  There is 12% Value Added Tax (VAT) usually included in the unit price.

It's a fact: ''consumerism'' has been part of a Filipino's life, even things they don't need but are in sale and discount they'll buy it. The reason why the country hasn't been affected much by recent financial crisis is because of the circulation of money, even if Filipinos are broke they'll find a way to buy something at least in a week for themselves. 

As stated above, living in the Philippines is cheap, shopping there is also cheap. Sales tend to happen during pay day and last for 3 days and also during the Christmas season (in the Philippines Christmas season extends from September to the first week of January) in Department stores like SM Department Store.

Stationery items are sold at a very low price as low as ₱10; however be careful as some items may contain high lead content.

*'''Clothes''': Bargained clothes as low as $3 are available in flea markets and Ukay-Ukays. Ukay-Ukays sell second-hand clothes from other countries at a cheap price.

Filipino cuisine has developed from the different cultures that shaped its history. As such, it is a melange of Indian, Chinese, Malay, Spanish, European and American influences. Though its cuisine is not as renowned as many of its neighbours, such as that of Thailand and Vietnam, Filipino cooking is nonetheless distinct in that it is possibly the least spicy of all South East Asian cuisines. Don't make the mistake of thinking that Filipino food is bland, though. It is just that instead of spices, Filipino food depends more on garlic, onions and ginger to add flavor to dishes. Painstaking preparation and prolonged cooking time is also a characteristic of most Filipino dishes, and when done properly is often what brings out the flavor of the food as, opposed to a healthy dose of spices. 
''Kamayan'', literally means Eating with Hands. Some Filipinos who were born and raised in rural provinces still eat with their hands, mostly at their homes during mealtimes. They would often say that ''Kamayan'' makes food taste better. Wash your hands clean before attempting this to avoid illnesses. Almost all Filipinos in the urban areas though use spoons, forks and knives. Eating with hands in public is not uncommon however if you're eating in a mid-range and splurge restaurant this may be considered rude.  

To experience how the Filipinos eat in a budget way, '''Carenderias''' (food stalls) and '''Turo-turo''' (meaning Point-point, which actually means you point at the food you want to eat in the buffet table) are some of the options. Mains cost less than $1. Carenderias serve food cooked earlier and it may not always be the safest of options. 

As with the rest of Southeast Asia, rice is the staple food of the Philippines. Some areas in the Visayas prefer corn but elsewhere Filipinos would generally have rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Uncooked rice usually comes in 50kg sacks but can be bought by the kilogram at the wet market or at neighborhood rice dealers. Single servings of rice are readily available at fastfood restaurants or eateries.

===Filipino diet===
The word ''diet'' is non-existent in the vocabulary of Filipinos or has never existed, as mentioned before they are laid back people, they love to eat as much as they can as if there is no tomorrow. They spend most of their money on food, a Filipino teenager might at least enter a fastfood chain two or three times a week, during fiestas in a city, town, ''barangay'', ''purok'' or subdivision Filipinos would have big parties and it would last from noon to midnight when some of the people would end up being drunk, you can ask if you can join a fiesta in a home and some might welcome you as this is a tradition. If you're visiting the Philippines it is the best time to cut your so called ''diet'' and eat to your heart's content. The Filipino diet is a lot more similar to the west than the east, with Filipinos eating less vegetables, more oil, meat and sugar than people in neighboring countries; most Filipinos aren't health conscious. Cancer and heart-related diseases are the leading causes of death here. However if you visit rural areas they use more vegetables and less meat and practice old Filipino medicine.

===Etiquette===
Some Filipinos use a rather strict interpretation of the ''serving spoon'' rule and believe that offering utensils or food that has come into contact with someone's saliva is rude, disgusting, and will cause food to get stale quickly. Singing or having an argument while eating is considered rude, as they believe food is ''grasya/gracia'' or blessed in English; food won't come to you if you keep disrespecting it. Singing while cooking is considered taboo because it will cause you to forever be a bachelor or spinster. Conservative Filipinos share another belief with the Chinese that not finishing your food on your plate is taboo and rude; you'll often see Filipino parents scolding their children to finish their food or not they'll never achieve good academic performance. 

Usually, before a meal starts or before food is served, Filipinos say a prayer;  wait until the host invites you to start eating. Also, it is rude to refuse food that the host has offered or to leave the dining table while someone is still eating. While eating in front of [[China#Eat|Chinese]]/[[Japan#Eat|Japanese]]/[[South Korea#Eat|Korean]] -Filipinos, don't stick your chopsticks vertically upright into a bowl of food.

===Cuisine===
Filipinos usually serve at least one main course accompanied by rice for lunch and dinner. At times you would have two with a vegetable dish accompanying a meat dish. On special occasions such as fiestas, several main dishes would be served, a Filipino party or a Fiesta wouldn't be complete without Spaghetti, Pasta, Fruit Salad, Ice Cream, Rice, spring rolls, cake or rice cakes and soda. Soups are also often the main course apart from being a starter. It is not uncommon for Filipinos to douse their rice with the soup and eat the meat that came with the soup alongside.

[[Image:BukoPie.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Buko Pie anyone?]]

'''Muslims''' will find it hard to find Halal food outside predominantly Muslim areas in the Philippines even though the country is one of the fastest emerging markets in exporting certified halal products. Ask if there is pork in the dish before eating it. '''Seventh Day Adventists''' would possibly find some vegetarian restaurants in the Philippines, mostly lurking in the commercial, financial and provincial capitals, and most of them use tofu instead of meat, Sanitarium products may be found in Seventh Day Adventists or Sanitarium hospitals. '''Hindus''' will find Indian restaurants which serve some vegetarian options around Metro Manila. '''Vegetarians''' and '''vegans''' will find it difficult to find a Filipino dish which is wholly vegetarian as most of the Filipinos love to add meat in every single dish they eat. Also vegetarianism is often unheard of in the country and is often ridiculed. 
 '''Jews''' will also find it hard to find '''Kosher''' meals. However rabbis in the Philippines suggest some stores which sell Kosher food, visit [http://www.citem.gov.ph/kosher/ Kosher Philippines] for advice.

==Drink==
[[Image:Happy hour boracay.jpg|thumb|250px|Sunset during Happy Hour on [[Boracay]]]]
===Non-alcoholic drinks===
Tropical fruit drinks made from ''dalandan'' (green mandarin), ''suha'' (pomelo), ''pinya'' (pineapple), ''calamansi'' (small lime), ''buko'' (young coconut), ''durian'', ''guyabano'' (soursop) mango, banana, watermelon, strawberry and many more are available at stands along streets, as well as at commercial establishments such as food carts inside malls. They are often served chilled with ice.

''Sago't Gulaman'' a sweet drink made of molasses, sago pearls and seaweed gelatin, and ''taho'', a sweet, warm snack made from sago pearls, soft tofu and carmelized syrup, are worth trying. They are  affordable and sold in stalls along streets or by vendors around the a common area as well as in malls. ''Zagu'' is a shake with flavors such as strawberry and chocolate, with sago pearls. Another famous drink is '''buko juice'', the juice is consumed via an inserted straw on the top of the buko or young coconut.

===Tea, coffee and chocolate===
''Salabat'', sometimes called ginger tea, is an iced or hot tea made from lemon grass and pandan leaves or brewed from ginger root. ''Kapeng barako'' is a famous kind of coffee in the Philippines, found in [[Batangas]], made from coffee beans found in the cool mountains. Try the Filipino hot chocolate drink, ''tsokolate'', made from chocolate tablets called ''tableas'', a tradition that dates back the Spanish colonial times.  ''Champorado'' [http://www.filipinoportal.com/food/champorado.html] isn't considered a drink by Filipinos, but it is another version of ''tsokolate'' with the difference of added rice. Records say that chocolate was introduced by the Aztecs to the Filipinos during the Manila-Acapulco trade.

===Alcoholic drinks===

Metro Manila is home to many bars, watering holes, and karaoke sites.  Popular places include Makati (particularly the Glorietta and Greenbelt areas), Ortigas Metrowalk, and Eastwood in Libis. Other big cities such as Cebu City and Davao also have areas where the nightlife is centered. Establishments serve the usual hard and soft drinks typical of bars elsewhere. Note that Filipinos rarely consume alcohol by itself. They would normally have what is called as "pulutan" or bar chow alongside their drinks which is like the equivalent of tapas. At the least, this would consist of mixed nuts but selections of grilled meats and seafood are not uncommon food alongside the customary drinks. When having a party, Filipinos enjoy drinking round-robin style using a common glass. One is supposed to drink bottoms-up before passing the glass to the next person. This custom is known as "tagayan" and one person usually volunteers to pour the drink.

Beer is perhaps the most common form of alcohol consumed in bars. San Miguel Beer is the dominant local brand with several variants such as Light, Dry, Strong Ice and their flagship variant Pale Pilsen. Budweiser, Heineken and Corona can also be found in upscale bars. Rum and ''ginebra'' which is the local form of gin are commonly available forms of hard liquor. Indigenous forms of liquor are ''lambanog'' and ''tuba'' which are both derived from coconut sap. Tuba is fermented from the coconut sap and though tuba itself can be drunk, it is also distilled to take the form of lambanog. Lambanog is now being marketed widely both locally and internationally in its base form as well as in several flavored variants such as mango, bubble gum and blueberry.

Alcohol is extremely cheap in the Philippines (and one of the cheapest in the whole of Asia). For a bottle of San Miguel bought at a 7-11 or Mini-Stop, a bottle would costs about ₱30-₱40 (about  US$0.65). Regular bars will offer it for ₱40-50, and even in top-end bars and clubs, a bottle would cost about ₱100-200. A bottle of 750ml Absolut Vodka at the supermarket will cost about     ₱750, and a popular local rum (especially amongst knowledgeable expats) ''tanduay'' costs just below ₱70 at a 24 hour convenience store in [[Makati]] (The Financial District).

==Sleep==
Housing options for tourists include hotels, condotels, apartelles, motels, inns/bed-and-breakfasts, and pension houses. 

Hotels are usually for the higher-end traveller, although hotel rates--even for four-star establishments-- are not very high compared to other international destinations. Condotels are furnished condominium units rented out for long or short term stays, apartelles are set up for both short and long term stays, and a pension house is usually more basic and economical. These all vary in terms of cleanliness, availability of air conditioning, and hot water showers. Motels, inns, and lodges also serve lodging purposes but have a reputation as meeting places for illicit sex, a unit being usually a small room with a connected carport, hidden behind a high wall which provides for secret comings and goings. You can distinguish these by their hourly rates, while more reputable institutions usually have daily rates.

==Stay safe==
Use common sense when travelling to and around the Philippines, as with traveling to other developing nations. It is wise to have Filipino friends as they will give you genuine advice on how to get by.  Although the people of these islands are generally friendly and accommodating, one must be aware of the prevalence of poverty (especially in big cities) and the things that, unfortunately, come with it.  You must not flash your valuables (especially expensive smartphones) because they pose a pickpocketing threat. Carry small change and don't flash large bills.  Pickpockets  are common in the big cities. Manila is not a place for violent robbery, but the ativan scam is common practice. Don't expect any reprisal from the police and must also sometimes be wary of them as they can be easily bribed and might be entangled in their own scams.   Do not enter alleyways and remote areas at night.      

See also [[common scams]] and [[pickpockets]].

Both Christian and Muslim areas of Mindanao have traditionally been home to organized criminal groups. Groups active in the drug and weapons trade, gambling or armed robberies aren't very likely to harass tourists. However, kidnappings especially in Muslim Mindanao regularly occur.  

Drive-by shootings are very common in Muslim Mindanao as well, and as of the 2010's rebels and criminal groups are resorting to more drive bys than kidnappings. So be careful being out in public, as these drive bys happen in broad daylight than at night. 

===Prostitution and drugs===
Prostitution is thriving but officially illegal in the Philippines, although hostess bars, massage parlors and other opportunities abound which offer commercial sex services. EDSA and Makati in Metro Manila, and Angeles City are known hot spots for these activities. The age of consent is 18. Rightfully, the Philippine National Police treat sex-offenders, child-molesters and people involved in prostitution harshly. Acts associated with prostitution and child sex abuse will result in you being jailed long term and then deported.

Marijuana and shabu (crystal methamphetamine) are, in fact, illegal. Penalties for drugs are very harsh and resisting the police may result in death. President Rodrigo Duterte has encouraged both citizens and police to kill suspected drug dealers and drug users and thousands of alleged drug dealers and drug users, including non-Filipinos, have been killed by citizens, police, and the military since his inauguration. If you want a high, stick to alcohol.

===Homosexuality===
The Philippines is a predominantly Roman Catholic country, but is home to one of the largest LGBT or "bayut" communities in Asia. '''Gays and lesbians''' will be fine in the Philippines, but please use common sense (eg: avoid public kissing) as you may get stares or even verbal profanity. But, nevertheless, Filipinos have their warm hospitality. Violence against gays and lesbians is rare, but there are many words for "gay" and "lesbian" that are thrown around in media and in culture - usually in a negative context.

==Stay healthy== 

===Eating and drinking===
Drink the readily available bottled water. Buko (young coconut) juice is also safe if they have not added local ice to it. Be wary also of Buko juice vendors, some usually just add sugar to water. Buy and eat fruit that has not already been cut up. Cooked food from a karenderia (outdoor canteen) is okay if there is a fire under the pots and the food has been kept hot. If you must drink tap water (it is usually served/contained in a small to medium plastic bag), water in Manila, Cebu City and other major cities, but it is recommended that you boil tap water for at least 5 minutes just to be safe. Elsewhere drink bottled water. There is always the risk of contracting amoebiasis when drinking tap water in the countryside. Also, this applies to ice that is usually put in beverages. Bottled water is best purchased from within stores and sheltered eateries. Bottled waters sold outside (by the roads) are more than likely used bottles filled with tap water, sealed then cooled. Be careful of drinking ''pampalamig'' (cold drinks like ''Sago't Gulaman'') as some of the vendors might be using ''Magic Sugar''(formally called Sodium Cyclamate); an artificial sweetener, which has been banned by the Philippine Government because of its adverse effects on health such as higher risk of getting cancer by consuming Magic sugar, it has been used as an alternative to ordinary sugar as it is much cheaper, call '''911''' (Philippine National Police) if you encounter such situation. Streetfood isn't ''so'' safe to consume in the Philippines, hygienic standards aren't enforced much. It is better to eat streetfood as well as ''pampalamig'' inside malls and shopping centers than in streets as stalls in malls and shopping centers have better enforcement of cleanliness.

===Diseases===
'''CDC'''[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/philippines.aspx] advises that risk of '''[[malaria]]''' exists in areas below 600 meters, except for the provinces of [[Aklan]], [[Bilaran]], [[Bohol]], [[Camiguin]], [[Capiz]], [[Catanduanes]], [[Cebu]], [[Guimaras]], [[Iloilo]], [[Leyte]], [[Masbate]], northern [[Samar]], [[Siquijor]], and [[Metro Manila]]. '''Chloroquine''' is no longer a recommended malaria preventative for anywhere in the Philippines. In general malaria is not common in the Philippines compared to Africa and the rest of mainland Southeast Asia, and around half of the c. 40,000 annual cases are in a couple of discrete locations. '''Dengue fever''' is common in the Philippines and cases rise every year, so it is advisable to apply anti-mosquito repellents and wear long sleeved clothes whenever possible. '''Rabies''' is also common among street animals in the country, so get a vaccination for rabies if you haven't already, and if you're traveling with children, vaccinate them as soon as possible as they are of high risk of getting rabies because they tend to play more with animals. '''Hepatitis A and B''' is a high risk in the country. Get a vaccine if you haven't had one, as you can contract hepatitis through exposure to contaminated food or water, sexual contact, or contact with blood of infected people. If you plan to visit rural farming areas, '''Japanese encephalitis''' is common, and vaccination is recommended. Avoid swimming in fresh water areas where you will have high risks of getting '''schistosomiasis''' (unless they are chlorinated). '''Leptospirosis''' is often contracted from recreational water activities, such as kayaking, in contaminated water.  

Also please note that '''tuberculosis''' is very common in the countryside, so try to avoid individuals who cough or look weak and be careful about staying too long in villages that may be high in contagious people.

you can buy for a low cost anti-diarrheal drugs in the Philippines, as unsanitary conditions present a high risk for traveler's diarrhea. Gatorade or other "sport drinks" might relieve you from fluid loss.
Drink bottled liquids if you are unsure of the water, and always wash your hands.

===HIV===
Over the last five years the rate of new '''HIV''' cases in the Philippines has been going up by over '''20%''' per year. by the end of May 2017 there were '''44,010''' people who knew they had HIV in the Philippines. the Philippines Department of Heath has said by the end of 2022 there could be 133,000 people living with HIV in the Philippines. so it pays to take precautions.
there are now 37 HIV treatment Hubs around the Philippines which provide free Antiretroviral drugs. Other '''sexually transmitted diseases''' are more common than HIV.

==Cope==

===Students discounts===
Get discounts on buses up to 20% and on any entrance tickets when showing your student card, even if not ISIC one.

===Electricity===
''See also: '''[[Travel topics]]''''' -- [[Electrical systems]]

Most of the Philippines is 220 Volt 60Hz mixed with the American and European plug. There is sometimes a ground in some areas. Americans will need a step-down transformer. It's best also to bring such items that work universally such as those electronics marked with a 100V-240V 50/60hz compatibility to avoid voltage concerns. 

3-phase voltage is 380v.

Downtown [[Baguio]] (northern Luzon) uses 110 V, and is also 60 Hz. This doesn't extend beyond the center of the city. The airport, for example, is 220V. If staying in the Baguio area, '''always ask first!'''  If your equipment is 100-127V, merely crossing a street corner can cause it to be damaged or even catch fire.  There are no signs in Baguio indicating where 110V ends and 220V begins.  

During drought seasons (March to May), most of the power-plants are hydro-electrics (as stated above in the climate section), regular black-outs happen during this time, ask if your hotel owns a generator.

===Television and video===
'''Television and Video is in NTSC'''. Region Coded DVDs are Region 3 (Southeast Asia), though virtually all Filipino movies are region free. 
Major Networks that operate are - ABS-CBN, GMA, and TV5, all operate in Filipino, which all compete for ratings making network wars part of Filipino culture from the corner of the street to your hotel reservations desk there would always be an argument which stations airs the best ''telenovelas'' (TV Drama Series). The three major stations air TV Series to Newscasts. ABS-CBN and GMA have regional substations who operate in their own major regional languages. ETC, operates in English with exceptions of Filipino, airs Foreign TV Series on English as well as franchised TV shows like Project Runway while Chase purely airs in English and its content is just Foreign TV Series on English. Studio 23 is ABS-CBN's free-to-air channel which targets sports fanatics and the young population. All 6 Channels operate free-to-air, most of the channels which operate purely on English are available on Cable TV alone - SkyCable and Global Destiny Cable are the best-known cable operators in the country while Dream is the country's sole satellite TV operator.  Almost all hotels and major commercial centres have cable or satellite TV. Channels such as BBC, CNN, Bloomberg. ABS-CBN's News Channel, ANC, provide 24/7 news headlines, updates, travel, business and lifestyle programs, almost always in  English except the early morning news show originating from ABS-CBN.

===Embassies and Consulates===
Several embassies and consulates are open in the Philippines, for a full detailed list of embassies visit [http://www.embassiesabroad.com/embassies-in/Philippines EmbassiesAbroad.com]

==Respect==
A little courtesy goes a long way. Filipinos are a very friendly and hospitable people, sometimes even to a fault. Take the time to smile and say "thank you", and you'll receive much better responses. You will receive an even better response if you throw in a little Tagalog, such as "salamat", which means "thank you".  When talking to the people who are usually old enough to be your parents or grandparents in Filipino, it is greatly appreciated to include ''po'' in your sentences such as ''salamat po, thought it also commonly used in formal situations between age peers and brings out the smiles.  For older persons call them also by ''Tito''(Uncle), ''Tita''(Aunt), ''Manong''(Mr.) or ''Manang''(Mrs./Ms.), ''Ate'' (older sister) or ''Kuya''(older brother) (words used to address people older than the speaker but not old enough to be an aunt or uncle. Older speakers will tend to use "manong" and "manang" instead) with their name, it is mean to call older people with their names. If you are having a conflict, stay relaxed, make a joke and smile. Getting angry or standing on your stripes will not bring you far, and you will lose respect.

In the countryside and in some urban homes, footwear is removed when entering a home, though they may make an exception for foreigners. The key is to look around before entering any home. If you see footwear just outside the door, more than likely the family's practice is to remove footwear before entering. If you wear socks, you don't have to remove them.

Although many Filipinos might not be able to afford tipping service workers, tipping is always accepted.  Tips are customary, and in some instances, mandatory in the more high-end environments such as hotels and major restaurants.

===Work===
When working with people in the Philippines, it's important to remember that they often bring cultural influences into the workplace and that don't always match well with your business culture. When you first meet another business person, it's important that you address them with both their title and both their first and last name. Businesses in the Philippines are often structured as a hierarchy and it's important to note that most decisions are made from the top down. Additionally, the Filipino value of "social harmony" doesn't always allow for directness when approaching sensitive issues. [http://www.trybpo.com/filipino-etiquette-vs-american-etiquette-understanding-the-differences/]

===Street children===
In many of the larger cities extreme poverty is prevalent. It is illegal to give money to beggars or the street children who run around at all hours.  If you really want to give something, food is the better alternative. At times, when children go up to foreigners they won't go away until you give something. To counter this, avoid swearing and just ignore them. They can understand swear words and might call on their friends to bug you even more.

===Political topics===
Keep in mind that the '''Marcos ''' years (1965-1986) can be a polarizing topic within the Philippines.  Visitors will find that the northern Ilokano Population view the regime as an era of stability, while metropolitan areas in the Bicol region take pride in the "EDSA" Revolution (Note: The Bicolanos are left-leaning, while the Ilokanos are conservative). Either way it is best to assess the speaker's opinion prior to approaching the topic.

Please note the '''Duterte Drug War''' (2016-Present) is also a highly sensitive topic.

==Contact==
The country code for the Philippines is 63. The area code for Metro Manila is 2.  To make a overseas call, include the prefix 00.

*'''Police, Medical and Fire''': 117/112/911. 117 may also be texted from cellphones.

The cheapest way to call to and from the Philippines is by using Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP), there are several licensed VoIP providers in the Philippines. One of the most popular is Vodini Telecom [http://www.vodini.com/]. 

===Newspapers===
English newspapers are available throughout the country and there are also some Japanese and Chinese language options. The Daily Tribune [http://www.tribune.net.ph/], Malaya [http://www.malaya.com.ph], Manila Standard [http://www.manilastandardonline.com/], Manila Bulletin [http://www.mb.com.ph/], Business World [http://www.bworld.com.ph/], Philippine Daily Inquirer [http://www.inquirer.net/] and Visayan Daily Star [http://www.visayandailystar.com/] are some of the English newspapers.

===Mobile phones===
There are three major companies operating GSM 900/1800 networks: Globe[http://www1.globe.com.ph/], Smart[http://smart.com.ph/] and Sun Cellular [http://www.suncellular.com.ph/].  Your home provider at home should have agreements with one of these providers so check with them before leaving home. Roaming may be quite expensive just as elsewhere however, pre-paid SIM cards of these networks are easy to acquire and cost as little as ₱30 and provide a cheaper alternative.  If your unit is locked to your home service provider, cellphone repair shops in various malls have ways of unlocking (the typical fee to unlock is ₱300 for relatively old basic phones but can go as high as ₱2,000 for high-end smart phones). If you don't have a phone to begin with, a complete pre-paid kit with phone and SIM can be purchased for as little as ₱1,500. Phones that come with these sot of deals are usually locked to a local network provider, and you would need to have it unlocked before leaving if you plan on using it elsewhere. 

GSM mobile phones are in wide use all over the country.  3G technology is available through Globe, Smart and Sun, but is poorly implemented and often not properly operational especially outside urban areas. In most urban locations and many resorts, cell phone service will be available. Please note that Sun cellular did not work outside the main island of Luzon. Globe or Smart is a much better choice.  The usual cost of an international long-distance call to the United States, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Europe or other major countries is US$0.40 per minute (converted to ₱ at the prevailing rate). Local calls range from ₱ 6.50 to 7.50 per minute for prepaid calls (a new law was passed that will eventually require per pulse, i.e. rates per 6-seconds charging) but unlike other countries, you won't be charged for incoming calls.  Take note that ringing a user in the same network as you (as well as affiliate networks) will cost less than ringing a user on a different or unaffiliated network.  Text messages typically cost as low as ₱1 and the Philippines is usually tagged as the "texting capital of the world". International SMS is charged at a higher rate of between  ₱15-25.  Bundles for cheaper/unlimited calls, SMS and/or mobile data are offered by the networks are available; but for call packages, the lower-cost minutes are almost always allocated to those made to parties within the same network and their affiliates.  Affiliate networks of SMART include Talk 'N Text, its parent company PLDT and in some cases Sun Cellular; whilst for Globe, its main affiliate is Touch Mobile.  To help you identify the network the other party is using for purposes of estimating costs, please refer to the following table:

Reloading (known in other countries as recharge/recharging or top-up/topping-up) pre-paid SIMs is a breeze. Electronic Load (E-Load) stations are everywhere from small corner stores to the large malls where you just give your mobile phone number and the amount you wish to load (Globe, Smart and Sun each have their load denominations to choose from for E-loading).  If you have a friend using the same mobile operator as you, you can load as little as a few pesos by letting him/her pass on some of his/her load to you and if you need hundreds of pesos worth of load, you can purchase pre-paid cards which are available in denominations of ₱100, ₱300 and ₱500  (approximately US$2.20, US$7 and 12 respectively).   

Due to the wide use of mobile phones, pay phones are increasingly becoming obsolete. Some malls and public places still do have them and they usually come in either the coin or card operated variety. Globe and PLDT are the usual operators. Phone cards are usually sold by shops which sell cellphone pre-paid loads and cards. Note that phone cards of one company can not be used with the other company's card operated phones.

===Internet===
Internet access areas of broadband speeds are plentiful in city malls, much less so outside the cities, but are growing at a rapid pace. Internet surfing rates depend primarily on where you surf and the medium used (e.g. WiFi or wired).  Internet services offered by hotels and shopping malls are expensive and can go up to  ₱200/hour (approximately US$5) but neighbourhood cafes can be as cheap as  ₱15/hour (approximately US$0.35).  Public place WiFi services in the Philippines is provided by Airborneaccess.net and WiZ is likely to cost  ₱100 (approximately US$2) for up to an hour.  But if you want cheaper, there is a internet cafe chain in SM malls called, "Netopia", that has a landline internet connection for around 20P an hour (about 0.46 US).  Coffee shops like '''Starbucks'''[http://www.starbucks.com/retail/locator/ViewAll.aspx?a=1&CountryID=201] and '''Seattle's Best'''[http://www.seattlesbest.com.ph/] as well as malls usually carry WiFi service, some of which are free to use.  Certain areas may also carry free WiFi.  The SM chain of malls offer free wifi, so you can sit virtually anywhere in the mall and access free wireless.  

In addition, you may want to consider buying a mobile broadband modem starting at ₱995 where service is also provided by Globe, Smart or Sun. Mobile broadband signals vary depending on available infrastructure on your particular location, but in general Smart has the largest network in the country, followed by Globe, and then Sun. It takes up to 24 hours for internet to be available on a new sim card. Mobile broadband comes both in postpaid and prepaid variants. To buy a modem and subscription you will have to go to one of the larger cities - the small shops the sell cell phones and sim cards aren't able to sell mobile broadband. "Loads" often cost just P20 (approximately USD0.45) an hour for most mobile internet modems.  However, service is usually slower during certain times--especially in the evening--due to a high volume of people surfing.  Even with a fast broadband dongle, service is guaranteed to slow down to a standstill.

===Mail===
Apart from the Philippine postal service, FedEx, UPS, and DHL courier services are also available. Local couriers such as LBC and Aboitiz are also available. Postal mail from abroad is often "lost", so don't send anything valuable.

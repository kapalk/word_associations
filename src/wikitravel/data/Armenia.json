Anatolia. It became the world's first Christian country more than 1,700 years ago in 301 AD and has a large Diaspora all over the world. As a former Soviet republic lying in the <a href=\"/en/Caucasus\" title=\"Caucasus\">Caucasus</a> region straddling <a href=\"/en/Asia\" title=\"Asia\">Asia</a> and <a href=\"/en/Europe\" title=\"Europe\">Europe</a>, Armenia has a rich and ancient culture.\n</p><p>Landlocked, Armenia is bordered by <a href=\"/en/Turkey\" title=\"Turkey\">Turkey</a> to the west, <a href=\"/en/Georgia_(country)\" title=\"Georgia (country)\">Georgia</a> to the north, <a href=\"/en/Iran\" title=\"Iran\">Iran</a> to the south, <a href=\"/en/Azerbaijan\" title=\"Azerbaijan\">Azerbaijan</a> to the east, and Azerbaijan's Naxcivan exclave to the southwest. Five percent of the country's surface area consists of Lake Sevan (<i>Sevana Lich</i>), the largest lake in the Lesser Caucasus mountain range. Armenia's many mountains and mountain valleys create a great number of microclimates, with scenery changing from arid to lush forest at the top of a mountain ridge.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Understand\">Understand</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Understand\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Although there are more and more road signs in Latin script, especially in Yerevan, English is not widely spoken in Armenia. Many taxi drivers and salespeople in grocery stores and malls do not speak or understand English. Russian has remained the most important foreign language.\n</p><p>You will be reminded frequently when visiting Armenia that it was the world's first officially Christian country, since countless monasteries are among Armenia's premier tourist attractions. Fortunately for those who might otherwise suffer monastery fatigue, many of these monasteries are built in places of incredible natural beauty, making the sites of monasteries like Tatev, Noravank, Haghartsin, Haghpat and Geghard well worth a visit even without the impressive, millennium old monasteries found there.\n</p><p>Since 2001 when Armenia celebrated the 1,700th anniversary of the nation\u2019s conversion to Christianity, the number of tourists visiting the country has grown by about 25% every year. Straddling Europe and Asia in the lesser Caucasus Mountains, an ex-Soviet state with a culture over 3,000 years old and examples of ancient architecture and art all over the countryside, this beautiful country offers something exotic for many tourists.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Armenian history extends for over 3,000 years. Armenians have historically inhabited the \"Armenian Highlands\", a vast section of mountains and valleys across eastern Anatolia and the Southern Caucasus. Armenian vassal states, principalities, kingdoms and empires have risen and fallen in different parts of this highland throughout history. They were only unified once, just before the time of Christ in the empire of Tigran the Great, an empire that stretched from the Caspian to the Mediterranean Sea. Much of Armenia's history has been spent under the domination of the great powers of the region. The western parts of Armenia were under Byzantine or Ottoman Turkish rule for long periods, while the eastern parts were under Persian or Russian rule. These empires often fought their wars on Armenian territory, using Armenian soldiers. It was a rough neighborhood, but Armenians managed to hold onto their language and church and prosper whenever given a chance. Armenia was located on the silk road, and Armenians built a network of merchant communities and ties extending from eastern Asia to Venice. Eventually, with the rise of nationalism, Armenians paid a heavy price for their religion and their envy-inducing wealth.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Armenian_Genocide\">Armenian Genocide</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Armenian Genocide\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Armenian Genocide was the Ottoman government's systematic extermination of about 1.5 million of its minority Armenian subjects inside their historic homeland, which lies within the present-day Republic of Turkey. The starting date is conventionally held to be 24 April 1915, the day that Ottoman authorities rounded up, arrested, and deported 235 to 270 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders from Constantinople to Ankara, the majority of whom were eventually murdered. The genocide was carried out during and after World War I and implemented in two phases: the wholesale killing of the able-bodied male population through massacre and subjection of army conscripts to forced labour, followed by the deportation of women, children, the elderly and infirm on death marches leading to the Syrian desert. Driven forward by military escorts, the deportees were deprived of food and water and subjected to periodic robbery, rape, and massacre. The Armenian Diaspora, which is larger than the number of Armenians within Armenia, was created. \n</p><p>The Armenian Genocide is still actively denied by Turkey.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Soviet_Armenia\">Soviet Armenia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Soviet Armenia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In many ways, the Soviet period was a golden one for Armenians. The price they paid for it was extraordinarily high, though, with arbitrary borders being drawn between Armenia and Azerbaijan (setting the stage for future conflict)). The country boomed economically, and there were heavily subsidized cultural education and activities. Yerevan mushroomed from a dusty garrison town of 20,000 to a metropolis of 1 million.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Modern_Armenia\">Modern Armenia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Modern Armenia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the early 1990s, the Armenians in Karabakh fought for independence from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora. The war was won militarily, resulting in Azerbaijan losing control of 20% of its territory, but no diplomatic solution was reached. A ceasefire has been in place since 1994, although it remains weak due to frequent skirmishes alongside the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. As a result, Azerbaijan has closed their borders with Armenia, and Turkey has also closed their borders with Armenia in support of their Azeri-Turk kinsmen. \n</p><p>Both countries have since imposed sanctions against Armenia, putting the local economy in a delicate situation because Armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate and unreliable. As a result, the economy relies heavily on investment and support from Armenians abroad. The economic situation has also been beset due to widespread corruption and poverty. \n</p><p>In 2008, diplomatic efforts to normalize relations with Turkey were initiated but were later suspended due to intense internal pressure on both sides, and disagreements between the two countries. Diplomatic efforts to normalize relations with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh territory have since been initiated and moderated by <a href=\"/en/Russia\" title=\"Russia\">Russia</a>, but these efforts have often proved ineffective due to frequent skirmishes alongside the border separating Armenia and Azerbaijan. Although highly unlikely, the government of  <a href=\"/en/Azerbaijan\" title=\"Azerbaijan\">Azerbaijan</a> regularly threatens to launch an invasion against Armenia if mediation over the Nagorno-Karabakh territory fails. \n</p><p>Until or unless the Armenians can resolve their differences with Turkey and Azerbaijan, the prospects of change seem remote at present.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Culture\">Culture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Culture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As Armenia straddles Europe and Asia, East and West, so does Armenian culture. Many Armenians refer to Armenia as a European nation, but their social conservatism in some realms hasn't been seen in Europe proper for a few decades. The collapse of the Soviet Union has opened up many channels with the West again and change is coming rapidly, although much more so in Yerevan than in the rest of the country. Armenia's small, very homogeneous population (about 99% Armenian) is strongly family-oriented. All across the land, people place a lot of pride in their hospitality. Show up in a village without a penny, and food and a place to stay will come to you along with drinks and endless toasts.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Religion\">Religion</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Religion\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>In 301 AD, Armenia became the first country in the world to adopt Christianity as a state religion. One can find thousands of churches and monasteries in Armenia. Armenians are Apostolic Christians and have their own Catholicos (religious leader, like the Pope for Roman Catholics).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Geography\">Geography</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=8\" title=\"Edit section: Geography\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Armenia is a small, mountainous, landlocked country whose geography almost never fails to surprise foreign visitors. Mountain passes, valleys and canyons make Armenia feel much larger than it really is, and when you're on its southern shores, Lake Sevan provides the sight of endless water. In addition to its geographic variation, Armenia's climate varies a great deal as well; be ready for everything from barren lunar landscapes to rain forests to snow-capped peaks and a vast alpine lake. There are some places in Armenia where several of these can be experienced at once.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9\" title=\"Edit section: Regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:512px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Armenia_regions_map.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/bf/Armenia_regions_map.png/510px-Armenia_regions_map.png\" width=\"510\" height=\"492\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/bf/Armenia_regions_map.png/765px-Armenia_regions_map.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/bf/Armenia_regions_map.png/1020px-Armenia_regions_map.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"1239\" data-file-height=\"1196\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Armenia_regions_map.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Map of Armenia's regions and the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region</div></div></div>\n<div id=\"region_list\">\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#33cc99\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Central_Armenia\" title=\"Central Armenia\">Central Armenia</a></b> <br />The political center of <a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">Armenia</a> contains much of the country's museums and cultural venues in <a href=\"/en/Yerevan\" title=\"Yerevan\">Yerevan</a>, the religious center of <a href=\"/en/Echmiadzin\" title=\"Echmiadzin\">Echmiadzin</a>, the 4100 m high volcano <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Aragats&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Aragats (page does not exist)\">Aragats</a> and the Monasteries of Geghard and Khor Virap.

On the Armenian side, you can get as far as Meghri by one Marshrutka a day from <a href=\"/en/Yerevan\" title=\"Yerevan\">Yerevan</a>. It leaves from the Sasuntsidavit bus stop that is near/behind the main train station. It leaves when it's full, so be there by 7:30 or 8:00 at the latest. Also be prepared for the marshrutka to be packed with luggage and people. That marshrutka might head down to Agarak after passing Meghri, though it's best to confirm this with the driver. The driver might also be able to set you up with a sleepover option close to the border in Agarak for about 10 \u20ac per night. In both directions, the marshrutka leaves quite early in the morning. \n</p><p>Kapan and Kajaran are more frequently served by marshrutkas, but it is a long and mountainous (and therefore expensive) stretch to the border from there. From Meghri, it is around 8 km to the border, and hitching or taking a taxi is the only option if your marshrutka didn't take you all the way to Agarak in the first place. On the Iranian side, the closest public transport can be found around 50 km to the west in <a href=\"/en/Jolfa\" title=\"Jolfa\">Jolfa</a>, so a taxi (around 10-15$) again is the only (commercial) choice. The border is not busy at all, so when hitching, you have to mainly stick with the truck drivers and knowing some Russian, Persian or Azeri/Turkish helps a lot here. Many truck drivers go from Norduz to <a href=\"/en/Tabriz\" title=\"Tabriz\">Tabriz</a>.

Starting at $6, you can choose from a variety of half to full day trips which include a good number of the country\u2019s major attractions. Some of the more remote and exotic destinations such as the Petroglyphs of Ughtasar and many of the caves require special planning.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_mini-bus_or_bus\">By mini-bus or bus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: By mini-bus or bus\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Public transportation is very good and inexpensive in Armenia, but it can be tough to get to more remote sites outside of populated areas. The system could be described as a hub and spoke system, with each city offering local transportation to its surrounding villages as well as connections to Yerevan. Most inter-city travel is by 14-seat minibuses or buses. Yerevan has several bus interchange stations that serve the whole country, so you should find out which bus interchange station services the area of your destination. Note that unlike many countries in Eastern Europe, Armenian minibuses do not sell tickets beforehand and, in fact, do not issue tickets at all. You simply pay the driver at any point during the trip (though some will collect at the beginning). Exact change is never required, but a 20,000 note for a 1,000 dram ride might present a problem. Tips are unheard of on public transportation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_taxi_or_car\">By taxi or car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: By taxi or car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The average Western tourist can hire a taxi to go almost anywhere in the country on very short notice. If you are traveling with a lot of big or heavy bags, then going by taxi is the best option. Prices are about 100 drams (33 US cents) per km. Most taxis do not have meters, though, so you should negotiate a price before you leave. A taxi is a good option for longer trips, especially if you don't like waiting for hours for a minibus.\nTip. Before arriving have \"GG\" taxi or \"Yandex\" taxi on your phone. They are cheap, fast and reliable.\n</p><p>If you are used to driving in the West and have not driven outside of America or Western or Central Europe, you should hire a driver when you rent your car, as driving in Armenia is often a difficult undertaking for the average tourist. A growing number of car rental companies may be used, including SIXT (office at Zvartnots airport), Europacar, Hertz, and Naniko.\n</p><p>Most main roads around Yerevan are in decent to fair shape, with some being in unusually good condition. When you travel north (Dilidjan) or south (Jermuk), roads are less well-maintained and rather bumpy, and you can feel this especially when using public transport! (Minibuses are often in bad condition, too.) Potholes are very much a part of the experience and can test your driving skills. Be careful and consider getting an all-wheel drive or sport utility vehicle when renting.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_thumb\">By thumb</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: By thumb\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Not as common as in the days of the post-Soviet collapse, hitchhiking is still perfectly safe and acceptable. Drivers often don't expect anything in the way of compensation, but offer anyway and sometimes they'll take the marshutni fare. Flag cars down by holding your arm in front of you and patting the air; this is how taxis, buses and marshutnis are flagged. Don't be too surprised if you befriend a driver during your ride and eventually end up staying at his house for a few days with his family!\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_bicycle\">By bicycle</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: By bicycle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Due to the mountainous terrain, bicycling is not as common a mode of transport in Armenia as it is in the rest of Europe.

Dollars, euros and rubles can be exchanged almost anywhere in the country, with other major currencies also easy to exchange. Exchange booths do not charge a commission, and rates are almost always quite competitive.\n</p><p>ATMs (Bankomats) are widely available in larger towns.

Many Armenians will simply round up their checks or else leave ten percent. Some caf\u00e9 staff are only compensated with the tips they earn, though you cannot always tell by the service they provide. Many restaurants have begun to charge a ten percent \u201cservice fee\u201d which they usually do not share with the waiters, and it is not clear what it is used for.

Tomatoes, eggplant (aubergine) and bell peppers are also part of the khorovats meal. \n</p><p>Borscht is a vegetable soup traditionally made with beetroot as a main ingredient, which gives it a strong red color. It is usually served warm with fresh sour cream.\n</p><p>Khash is a traditional dish that originated in the Shirak region. Formerly a nutritious winter food for the rural poor, it is now considered a delicacy and is enjoyed as a festive winter meal.\n</p><p>Dolma (stuffed grape leaves; a variety with stuffed cabbage leaves, bell peppers and eggplants) also exists.\n</p><p>Armenian fruits and vegetables are special. One should definitely try them and will never forget the taste of Armenian apricot, peach, grapes, pomegranate, etc.\n</p><p>Armenian bread is very tasty as well. There is a wide range of different types of bread, starting from black and white till lavash (a soft, thin flatbread) and matnaqash.\n</p><p>Don\u2019t miss trying milk products! Along with ordinary milk products, there are some traditional and really tasty and refreshing ones. Matsun (yogurt) is a traditional Armenian dairy product that has centuries of history. It contains a number of natural microelements, which have high biochemical activity. It\u2019s really refreshing, especially when you try it cold during hot summers. Okroshka, cold soup with kefir and cucumber and dill, is a healthy and refreshing dairy dish. Spas is really tasty hot kefir soup with grains in it.\n</p><p>Caf\u00e9 culture rules in Armenia, and the best places to have a cup of coffee and people-watch are sidewalk caf\u00e9s. Any place near the Opera is certain to be jumping late into the summer nights.

If you don't personally know any Armenians, one way to access the true Armenia away from the Westernized hotels and \"Armenian branded\" hotels is to find a reliable travel agent based in Armenia.\n</p><p>There are a couple of hostels in Yerevan. Outside Yerevan, there are a few main recreational areas that offer very reasonable accommodations, but you will be required to live without some conveniences. At the high end are some hotels on Lake Sevan and in Northern Lori Marz (50&#160;km from the Georgian border). You won't miss anything here, but you will pay Western prices for the accommodations. Around Lake Sevan, there are numerous types of cottages and hotels. Prices are reasonable and start at about US$10 per day for a cottage with electricity and within walking distance from the lake. The city of Sevan, because of its proximity to Yerevan, is the most popular place on Lake Sevan. The history, culture and non-Western feel of the accommodations change as you go south along the lake.\n</p><p>Tavush Marz is a wonderful place to spend time during the summer. Dilijan and Ijevan are wonderful towns to be based in, as day trips are possible to the many ancient churches that pepper this remote region. Costs are very reasonable. Dilijan is known for its sanatoriums from the Soviet era. Don't expect hot water all hours of the day, but you can have a lovely room that will accommodate a family and include food for about US$20 a day. Take another US$20 to hire a car for the day to visit the surrounding historical sites.\n</p><p>Lori Marz is the second most beautiful region after Vayots Dzor. It has many health resort areas such as Stepanavan and Dendropark (Sojut) next to village Gyulagarak. Lori is considered to be the Armenian Switzerland. It has numerous churches, monasteries, medieval bridges and monuments. The Stepanavan area is great for hiking, tasting fresh dairy products, etc. Small hotels and B&amp;Bs are available in Stepanavan, Odzun, Tumanian, etc.\n</p><p>Tzaghkadzor is a well-known winter retreat. It has many lovely hotels and is popular year-round. Check with a travel agent to find the best deal for the activity you are interested in. Jermuk, made famous by the bottled water of the same name, is a wonderful getaway, but will require you to leave your Western expectations behind.\n</p>\n<ul><li><span class='vcard' id = 'JRs_House_hostel'><span class=\"fn org\">JR\u2019s House hostel</span>, <span class=\"adr\"><span class=\"street-address\">4/1 James Bryce Street 0019 Yerevan Armenia</span></span> (<span class=\"note directions\">4/1 James Bryce Street 0019 Yerevan Armenia right(Bagramyan Avenue) Close to the American University of Armenia and UK Embassy</span>), <span class=\"tel\"><abbr class=\"type\" title=\"voice\">\u260e</abbr> <span class=\"phone value\">+374 93 378889</span></span>, <a class=\"url external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.jrshouse.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>. <span class=\"description\">An easy walk from down town Yerevan, JR\u2019S HOUSE hostel is excellent value for money accommodation in the heart of Armenia.

However, theft and pickpocketing targeting foreigners are not unheard of, and utmost care is essential. Use common sense when walking on the street at night, especially after drinking. There are well known scams operating on some ATM machines, particularly those accepting VISA cards, where no money is issued but cash is withdrawn from the account nevertheless.\n</p><p>Female visitors should be aware that unaccompanied women are an unusual sight after dark. In the outskirts of the city, a single woman walking alone at night may attract unwanted attention.\n</p><p>There are people at the Zvartnots International Airport who ask tourists if they need a taxi. These people escort tourists to a car and claim that it is an airport taxi which costs two or three times more than a regular taxi. Never trust such people, even if they have already put your luggage in the trunk! You can find a taxi which costs 2,000-3,000 dram instead of the c.10,000 dram they are asking. That's definitely a scam, and many tourists have been tricked in this way. If you want to know whether a car is a real taxi, look at the number plate: if it is yellow or the first are 3 digit numbers (NOT 2 digit), then it is a taxi you want to take a ride in! And keep in mind that in almost every taxi 1km is 100 drams, but you must pay 500 drams for the first km (even if you only ride 2km).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=45\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As with any travel experience, eat well, but do not overeat.

In order to avoid financial expenses to run paid professional army based on contract, the government forces male citizens to serve in army sending them to war zones, which results in death of many innocent young men. Bitterness and hatred against Azerbaijanis (because of Karabakh conflict) and Turks (because of the Armenian Genocide) run very high.\n</p><p>History is more than a science in Armenia; it is a part of Armenian nationalistic ideology. So the issue of the Armenian Genocide, in which most of the Armenian people and a majority of Western scholars believe up to one and a half million Armenians were killed by the Young Turk government during World War One, is an extremely sensitive one, and caution and great respect should be shown when discussing the subject. One can find out more about the Armenian Genocide by visiting the Genocide Memorial 'Tzitzernakabert'. There is also a museum near the memorial.<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.the-american-times.com/armenia-photos/2013/04/14?nggpage=2/\">[7]</a> \n</p><p>Having been liberated by the then-Russian Empire in 1828, Armenians are partly Slavophiles; ask as many questions as you like about soccer and Soviet TV programs.

The \"ladies first\" rule is considered important, and it is considered polite to let women be the first to board the bus or train or enter a room; you'll find this the case with virtually all other countries within the CIS/CSTO area.\n</p><p>When visiting churches, both men and women are expected to dress modestly (i.e., no shorts, miniskirts, sleeveless shirts or tops, etc.). Lighting a candle is always a nice gesture, but is optional. You should always talk quietly when you are visiting a church.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact\">Contact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=48\" title=\"Edit section: Contact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Yerevan is full of internet cafes and internet phone offices, and these are beginning to pop up in a number of towns outside of Yerevan as well. International calling is available through prepaid mobile phone cards. Short-term mobile phone rental is also possible. Regular calls can always be made from the post office and is cheap within Armenia, but is a bit expensive for international calls. For much cheaper rates, try to find a phone office that uses the internet. Local calls can be made from kiosks or the rare payphone.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mobile_phone_providers\">Mobile phone providers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Armenia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=49\" title=\"Edit section: Mobile phone providers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are three 2G, 3G and one 4G service providers operating in Armenia. You're strongly advised to acquire a temporary pre-paid SIM card as they are cheap and convenient, allow both local and international calls, do not charge for incoming calls, and charge no monthly fee. Mobile internet and UTMS are also offered from all companies, as well as the normal full range of wireless services. \n</p><p><b>VivaCell</b> and <b>Ucom</b> have booths offering free SIM-Cards to incoming visitors at the airport. They are also easiest to top-up (at pretty much any store or kiosk in the country) and have better English services, rates and coverage. \n</p><p>The majority of foreign visitors find their unlocked mobile phones compatible with Armenian SIM cards (GSM 900/1800). <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://maps.mobileworldlive.com/network.php?cid=193&amp;cname=Armenia,%20Republic%20of\">GSM coverage maps of Armenia</a>.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.mts.am/\"><b>VivaCell-MTS</b></a> (Armenian, English and Russian) is the leading GSM service provider in Armenia and offers quality service at reasonable rates (owned by the Russian giant MTS).

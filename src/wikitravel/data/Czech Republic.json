From time immemorial, Czechs, Germans, Jews and Slovaks, as well as Italian stonemasons and stucco workers, French tradesmen and deserters from Napoleon\u2019s army, have all lived and worked here, all influencing one another. For centuries they jointly cultivated their land, creating works that still command respect and admiration today. It is thanks to their inventiveness and skill that this small country is graced with hundreds of ancient castles, monasteries and stately mansions, and even entire towns that give the impression of being comprehensive artifacts. The Czech Republic contains a vast amount of architectural treasure, as well as beautiful forests and mountains to match.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The contemporary Czech lands were originally inhabited by the Boii, a Celtic tribe for the first four centuries of the common era. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Celts gave way to Germanic tribes. Another four centuries later, Slavs arrived from the east, and by the 9th century, had established the Great Moravian Empire, stretching from modern-day Germany to <a href=\"/en/Ukraine\" title=\"Ukraine\">Ukraine</a>. After the fall of Great Moravia, the Lands of the Bohemian Crown was formed, whose borders for most of its history remain nearly identical to contemporary Czech borders. From the 11th to the 14th century, massive ethnic German colonization, known in German as the <i>Ostsiedlung</i>, occurred in the then-underpopulated borders of the kingdom. \n</p><p>Under the reign of Emperor Charles IV in the second half of the 14th century, the Bohemian Kingdom became the center of the Holy Roman Empire, with <a href=\"/en/Prague\" title=\"Prague\">Prague</a> as its capital, ushering in the kingdom's golden era. Under his enlightened and largely peaceful reign, royal investment into Czech institutions, culture, education, and infrastructure received royal patronage. Among some of those gifted with Charles IV's personal and financial support (many of which today bear the emperor's name) were Prague's Charles Bridge, Charles University, its New Town, St. Vitus Cathedral, Karl\u0161tejn Castle, and the foundation of the city of <a href=\"/en/Karlovy_Vary\" title=\"Karlovy Vary\">Karlovy Vary</a>. Bohemia's golden era came to an end with Charles' death in 1378. \n</p><p>Following Charles' death, the kingdom slowly slid into religious anarchy. The rise of Jan Hus and his Hussite followers in the 1410s violently rejected the supremacy of the Roman Catholic Church, sparking a series of Hussite Wars that lasted until the 1430s, placing Czech proto-Protestant peasants and sympathetic lords against crusading Catholic armies. Divided into various factions that often fought amongst themselves as they did against Catholics, Hussite Bohemia won a degree of autonomy from the Catholic Church during the 15th century, helped in part by an uneasy peace held between Hussite King George of Pod\u011bbrady and Rome. His successor, the Catholic Vladislaus II, caused many Hussite areas of the kingdom to revolt, which successfully forced the monarch to acknowledge the Hussites' religious freedom. \n</p><p>The Bohemian Kingdom was inherited by the Habsburg-led Austrian Empire after King Louis II was killed fighting the Turks at the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526, an event that would have tremendous repercussions for the next four hundred years. In 1618, the kingdom revolted against its Catholic Habsburg administrators, sparking the tumultuous Thirty Years' War. Defeated and humiliated at the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, the Czechs endured a strong Habsburg imperial occupation and forced Catholicization for decades to come. Despite the occupation, the Czech lands prospered under Austria, with Baroque palaces and buildings spreading across the kingdom throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The Czech lands became one of the first to industrialize by the 19th century, rising to one of the most economically advanced parts of the empire. At the same time, the Czech National Revival spurred nationalist and pan-Slavic feelings among the populace, which resulted in a cultural backlash against Austrian Germanization.  \n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Night_view_of_the_Castle_and_Charles_Bridge,_Prague_-_8034.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Night_view_of_the_Castle_and_Charles_Bridge%2C_Prague_-_8034.jpg/300px-Night_view_of_the_Castle_and_Charles_Bridge%2C_Prague_-_8034.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Night_view_of_the_Castle_and_Charles_Bridge%2C_Prague_-_8034.jpg/450px-Night_view_of_the_Castle_and_Charles_Bridge%2C_Prague_-_8034.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Night_view_of_the_Castle_and_Charles_Bridge%2C_Prague_-_8034.jpg/600px-Night_view_of_the_Castle_and_Charles_Bridge%2C_Prague_-_8034.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"4368\" data-file-height=\"2912\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Night_view_of_the_Castle_and_Charles_Bridge,_Prague_-_8034.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Prague Castle and the Charles Bridge.</div></div></div>Shortly before the end of World War I and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the closely-related Slavic nations of Czechs and Slovaks declared their independence, merging together to form the new state of Czechoslovakia on 28 October 1918. With Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, a highly-esteemed philosopher and sociologist (who remains well-regarded to the current day) as head of state, the First Republic\u2014as it became known\u2014managed to remain as the only democracy in Central Europe throughout the 1920s and '30s. Highly industrialized and pragmatic, the First Republic acted as an island of stability, facing off threats from a revanchist <a href=\"/en/Poland\" title=\"Poland\">Poland</a> to the north, politically unstable <a href=\"/en/Austria\" title=\"Austria\">Austria</a> and <a href=\"/en/Germany\" title=\"Germany\">Weimar Germany</a> to the south and west, and an irredentist <a href=\"/en/Hungary\" title=\"Hungary\">Hungary</a> to the southeast. The First Republic culturally and economically flourished during this period, and is often considered as another golden era by many modern Czechs. However, the state's strong centralization resulted in a poor relationship with its Sudeten German population, who accounted for 20% of the overall population\u2014more than the state's total amount of Slovaks\u2014as well as with its smaller Hungarian and Polish minorities. Combined with the rise of fascism and ethnic nationalism, this situation was exploited by Hitler, Hungary's Horthy and Poland's \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz as a pretext to annex large swaths of Czechoslovakia in 1938 during the Sudetenland Crisis, effectively ending the First Republic. A year later in March 1939, Nazi Germany occupied the remaining rump Czech lands and declared it a protectorate of the Third Reich, while Slovakia was forced to secede as a puppet state. This resulted in a brutal occupation that lasted until 1945, marked by mass arrests, torture, and the genocide of much of Czechoslovakia's Jewish and Romani population. A major event during the occupation was the complete destruction of the village of Lidice, located 22 km (14 mi) northwest of Prague, in reprisal for the assassination of Reich Protector Reinhard Heydrich by British-trained Czechoslovak paratroopers. \n<p>After World War II, the newly-reunited Czechoslovakia expelled nearly the entirety of its ethnic German population, as well as tens of thousands of Hungarians by force with the Bene\u0161 Decrees, an act of mass revenge that remains controversial to this day. The country miraculously emerged from the conflict more or less intact as it avoided the air bombardments and pitched battles that reduced its neighbouring states to ruins. However, the country fell within the Soviet sphere of influence, with the Czechoslovak Communist Party staging a coup in February 1948, toppling its democratic government. \n</p><p>At the beginning of the Stalinist 1950s, massive and numerous Soviet-inspired show trials, purging \u201csubversive conspiratorial elements\u201d took place; the most commonly known was the death sentence of anti-fascist social democrat Milada Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1. Following Stalin's death and the subsequent de-Stalinization of the country, more moderate forces gradually took control of the Communist Party, which included party leader Alexander Dub\u010dek, who wished to liberalize Czechoslovakia and create \u201csocialism with a human face.\u201d In a brief period known as the Prague Spring (<i>Pra\u017esk\u00e9 jaro</i>), travel, media and speech restrictions were greatly loosened, and the country would be federalized. By August 1968, a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion force militarily deposed Czechoslovakia's liberal leadership and ended its new freedoms. Mass anti-Soviet demonstrations in the following year ushered in the Normalization era (<i>Normalizace</i>), a period of harsh repression and conservatism. In November 1989, in the wake of elections in <a href=\"/en/Poland\" title=\"Poland\">Poland</a>, protests in <a href=\"/en/Hungary\" title=\"Hungary\">Hungary</a>, and the collapse of the Berlin Wall nearby in <a href=\"/en/Germany\" title=\"Germany\">Germany</a>, the totalitarian lid could no longer be held. Growing popular discontent and the brutal actions of the state police spilled over into mass demonstrations that helped topple the communists peacefully, in an event known as the Velvet Revolution. A democratic federal government was quickly installed.\n</p><p>At the stroke of midnight on 1 January 1993, Czechoslovakia peacefully dissolved upon an agreement between Czech bureaucrats and Slovak nationalists in the Velvet Divorce, becoming the new states of the Czech Republic and <a href=\"/en/Slovakia\" title=\"Slovakia\">Slovakia</a>. Joining NATO in 1999 and the EU in 2004, the contemporary Czech Republic is a stable, democratic parliamentary republic. \n</p><p>The Czech flag is the same one formerly used by Czechoslovakia, originally adopted in 1920.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Holidays\">Holidays</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Holidays\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:F%C3%A1jl-_Karlovy_Vary.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/F%C3%A1jl-_Karlovy_Vary.jpg/300px-F%C3%A1jl-_Karlovy_Vary.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/F%C3%A1jl-_Karlovy_Vary.jpg/450px-F%C3%A1jl-_Karlovy_Vary.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/21/F%C3%A1jl-_Karlovy_Vary.jpg/600px-F%C3%A1jl-_Karlovy_Vary.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"4000\" data-file-height=\"3000\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:F%C3%A1jl-_Karlovy_Vary.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Spas and apartments in <a href=\"/en/Karlovy_Vary\" title=\"Karlovy Vary\">Karlovy Vary</a>.</div></div></div>\n<ul><li><b>New Year's Day, Restoration Day of the Independent Czech State</b> (<i>Nov\u00fd rok, Den obnovy samostatn\u00e9ho \u010desk\u00e9ho st\u00e1tu</i>), 1 January: Celebration of the New Year and the 1993 splitting of Czechoslovakia. Most businesses are closed, with most staying indoors with their families.</li>\n<li><b>Good Friday</b> (<i>Velk\u00fd p\u00e1tek</i>), the Friday before Easter: A day of church services for the faithful, although most Czechs take the opportunity to start a four-day Easter weekend. Some businesses will be closed or with irregular hours. </li>\n<li><b>Easter</b> (<i>Velikonoce</i>), Easter Monday: It is customary for guys to (slightly) spank girls and women with a wicker stick with colourful ribbons at the end (<i>poml\u00e1zka</i>) to grant them fertility and good health, and in return girls and women will give the men coloured eggs, candy or drinks. In areas close to the Slovak border in Moravia, it also common to douse women with cold water. Obviously tourists are often (but not always) exempt. </li>\n<li><b>Witch Burning</b> (<i>P\u00e1len\u00ed \u010darod\u011bjnic</i>) or <b>Night of Witches</b> (<i>\u010carod\u011bjnice</i>), 30 April. On the last April evening, bonfires are lit around the country. \"Witch\" effigies, as a symbol of evil, are made and burned in the fire. This is the reinterpretation of the old pagan festival Beltane, influenced by the Catholic inquisition. As some Czechs prefer witches over the inquisitors, in many fires no witches are burnt, and the feast is celebrated in a more original pagan way - witches are those who should celebrate the night, not be burnt. It doesn't stop jokes like \"Honey, hide or you will be burnt tonight!\". This is a cultural holiday, and not a public one.  </li>\n<li><b>May Day</b> (<i>Sv\u00e1tek pr\u00e1ce</i>), 1 May: Celebration of workers rights and struggles. Once an enormous affair during communism, since the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, May Day is now largely a quiet day of rest and barbeques, with only some small political gatherings by social democrats or unrepentant communists. A public holiday with most businesses closed.  </li>\n<li><b>Liberation Day</b> (<i>Den v\u00edt\u011bzstv\u00ed</i>), 8 May: Commemoration of the defeat of Nazi Germany. A public holiday with most businesses closed.</li>\n<li><b>Last Ringing</b> (<i>Posledn\u00ed zvon\u011bn\u00ed</i>), late April to mid May: Traditional celebration of the end of the last year at high school, usually a week or more before <i>maturita</i> (the final exam) takes place. Students get a free day and usually do silly things in costumes, sometimes going into the streets to collect money from people passing by, sometimes threatening them with water, writing on their faces with lipstick, or spraying them with perfume. The collected money is used for parties after the exams. </li>\n<li><b>St. Cyril and St. Methodius Day</b> (<i>Den slovansk\u00fdch v\u011brozv\u011bst\u016f Cyrila a Metod\u011bje</i>), 5 July: Celebration of the Christian saints' arrival in the Slavic lands of Great Moravia.

Mikul\u00e1\u0161 gives small presents and candy to children to reward good behaviour, while the devil chastises children for wrongdoings over the course of the year and gives them potatoes, coal (or sometimes spankings) as a punishment. Old Town Square in Prague is a great place to watch the festivities. Strictly a cultural holiday. </li>\n<li><b>Christmas</b> (<i>V\u00e1noce</i>), 24-25 December: Czechs begin celebrating this holiday on Christmas Eve and continue to celebrate until the 26th (the Feast of Stephen). Presents are placed under a Christmas tree by <i>Je\u017e\u00ed\u0161ek</i> (Baby Jesus), as little children believe, and taken after dinner on Christmas Eve. Potato salad with carp is the traditional Christmas meal, and for this reason one can see live carp being sold out of huge tanks throughout the streets of Czech cities and towns just before Christmas.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Historic_regions\">Historic regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Historic regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bohemia\">Bohemia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Bohemia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Although the modern adjective <i>bohemian</i> refers to Bohemia, its usage was based on a broad stereotype and also a poor grasp of geography, so don't expect the Bohemians you meet to be nomadic or anti-conventional artistic/literary <i>bohemians</i>, or to see anything out of Puccini's \"La Boh\u00e8me\". And no, <i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i> (its lyrics sprinkled with Italian and Arabic) is not a local anthem!\n</p><p>The words <i>Bohemia</i> and <i>Bohemian</i> originate from the Boii Celtic tribe.

However, it was also used to refer to any inhabitant of Bohemia, including the vast number of Sudeten Germans that used to inhabit the region until 1945.

Despite this history, Moravia did not experience the process of mass urbanisation as in neighboring Bohemia.

Even the regional capital and its largest city, <a href=\"/en/Brno\" title=\"Brno\">Brno</a>, remains known for its small town atmosphere. The region's strategic location at the Moravian Gate (a pass through the imposing mountain ranges of Central Europe) has led to a confluence of a great amount of history.  Culturally, Moravians prefer a slower pace of life than Bohemians, with some Moravians confessing to have stronger affinities with <a href=\"/en/Slovakia\" title=\"Slovakia\">Slovakia</a> than with Bohemia. \n</p><p>The dialects of Czech spoken in Moravia are slightly different from those spoken in neighboring Bohemia, particularly in Prague. Moravians pride themselves on their dialect and learning a few stereotypical regionalisms will go down well with the locals (for example, for the word \"tram,\" say <i>\u0161alina</i> (SHAL-lin-NUH) instead of the Bohemian <i>tramvaj</i>).\n</p><p>Czech Silesia to the very east is often regarded as the heavy industrial center of the republic, known extensively for its coal mines and steel mills, with <a href=\"/en/Ostrava\" title=\"Ostrava\">Ostrava</a> as its largest city and cultural center, and <a href=\"/en/Opava\" title=\"Opava\">Opava</a> as its historical capital.

Tickets from all three of the republic's rail companies can be purchased online, and can be printed either at home or shown on tablets and smartphones to the conductor once aboard. Tickets can also often be bought in person at the station from window agents. RegioJet and LEO Express ticket agents near universally speak English, while \u010cesk\u00e9 dr\u00e1hy's agents outside of the main cities often cannot. In order to avoid any potential language confusion, travellers can write the destination name and the desired time of their journey, which will be universally understood by the \u010cD agent. Smaller \u010cD stations or stops without an active agent window or office will usually have conductors on their passing trains to purchase tickets from once you board. \n</p><p>Frequent users of \u010cesk\u00e9 dr\u00e1hy can register online for its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.cd.cz/eshop/customer/loyaltyprogram.aspx\">Loyalty Programme</a>, earning points for every trip taken under their name. With more points accumulated, users can receive significant discounts off of future rail travel, as well as discounts for attractions or for other activities listed online. Similarly, users of LEO Express can also join its <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://leoexpress.cz/cms/rewards-1221.htm\">Smile Club</a> to collect kilometers as points for future travel discounts. RegioJet offers <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://bustickets.regiojet.com/CreateAccount?1\">registration</a> for discounted travel, although it does not have a rewards programme. \n</p><p>If you are buying in person, travellers on \u010cD going on a roundtrip journey can receive a 5% discount, and when travelling in a group (even two travellers are considered as a \"group\"), the first person pays full price, while the second gets a 25% discount, and others get a 50% discount.

Perhaps the best-known bus carrier is <b><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://regiojet.com\">RegioJet</a></b>. Formerly known as <b>Student Agency</b> for many years, RegioJet's yellow buses are easy to spot on many roads and highways throughout the country, and are known for their comfort, entertainment options, wi-fi, and free coffee, water and tea for travellers. \n</p><p>A number of smaller bus companies also operate throughout the Czech Republic. Local travel between smaller towns or surrounding villages is usually operated by companies named <b>\u010cSAD (<i>district name</i>)</b>, a remnant of the state-run <i><b>\u010c</b>esko<b>s</b>lovensk\u00e1 <b>A</b>utobusov\u00e1 <b>D</b>oprava</i> from communist times. On local buses, simply tell the driver where you're going, or hold up a sign if you can't pronounce the location. Be aware that most bus drivers cannot speak English. Afterwards, you will receive a paper ticket from a small machine showing the price and destination, and will pay the driver the fare printed. An excellent database to search for all connections is through <b><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://jizdnirady.idnes.cz/vlakyautobusymhdvse/spojeni/\">Idos</a></b>, a highly comprehensive timetable for bus connections.

However, much is still missing from the map, blocked by government mismanagement and corruption, though there are plans to connect the entire country with high-speed motorways by 2030. Until then, drivers can sometimes expect detours on smaller roads with high vehicle capacity and many areas of construction. \n</p><p><b>Motorways</b> are demarcated by red and white signs with only a number on it. Below motorways are <b>first class roads</b>, with blue and white signs and a one or two-digit number. Many first-class roads are two or sometimes four-laned, and are generally considered to connect medium-sized municipalities together. Next are <b>second class roads</b>, also blue and white, with a three-digit number. These roads are smaller and located in the countryside, though still provide a degree of traffic between locations. Finally are the <b>third class roads</b>, with four-digits, which are countryside roads used for rural traffic. The condition of many smaller state and local roads is continually improving, yet to be economical (and fast), use motorways as much as possible, although if you want to get to more remote parts of the country you cannot avoid second or third class roads whose conditionals could be subpar.\n</p><p>In order to use motorways, drivers need to purchase a <b><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.sfdi.cz/en/vignettes/\">vignette</a></b>. These cost 310CZK (12\u200e\u20ac) for ten days, 440CZK (16.50\u20ac) for a month, and 1500CZK (56.50\u20ac) for a year. Vignettes can be purchased at petrol stations or vignette offices close to the border, or in <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/sluzby/prodej-a-eshop\">\u010cesk\u00e1 po\u0161ta</a> offices around the country. If you do not have a vignette on your car when driving on motorways, the fine can be very steep (5000CZK minimum). Vehicles over 3.5 tonnes in weight must use an on-board unit (<i>premid</i>) to pay tolls based on distance; this is required also on primary roads (marked with a <b>M</b> in a circle). Drivers can also easily obtain pre-paid <i>premids</i> at most petrol stations.\n</p><p>The use of headlights or day-time lights is mandatory at all times (day-time lights are allowed between dawn and dusk and in good visibility only). Failure to comply with this may result in a fine of up to 2000CZK. If other cars are flashing their high beam at you, it might be a friendly warning that your headlights are off.\n</p><p>Speed limits in the Czech Republic are <b>130 km/h (81 mph) on motorways</b>, <b>90 km/h (56 mph) on rural first class roads</b> and <b>50 km/h (31 mph) through towns</b>. Petrol is inexpensive compared to the rest of Europe, yet remains expensive compared to North America due to taxes. Speeding is common but so are speed traps and speeding cameras, especially if you do not know the area. Many drivers use the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.waze.com/\">Waze mobile app</a> to warn fellow motorists about speed traps, hazards on road etc., so if you purchased a local SIM card with a good data plan (or if you have good roaming data plan on your own), try it out.\n</p>\n<div style=\"width:95%; float:center; border: none; margin: 0.5em 0 0 1em; padding: 0.4em;\">\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3fff3; border:1px solid; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p>Unlike most of the motorway network, the <b>D1 motorway</b> between <a href=\"/en/Prague\" title=\"Prague\">Prague</a> and <a href=\"/en/Brno\" title=\"Brno\">Brno</a> is in a bad shape. Although reconstruction is slowly underway, there are still long sections of misaligned concrete blocks which cause a bumpy ride. Combined with heavy traffic, reckless driving styles, rapidly changing weather due to the higher elevation (as the motorway crosses the <a href=\"/en/Bohemian-Moravian_Highlands\" title=\"Bohemian-Moravian Highlands\">Bohemian-Moravian Highlands</a>) and virtually no detour routes, it makes the D1 notorious for mind-bogglingly long traffic, little patience, and car crashes. <b>Drive carefully</b>; the 130 km/h speed limit is in many places too fast for this route, especially if you don't know the terrain well.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table></div>\n<p><br />\nThe Czech Republic is a <b>zero tolerance</b> country. It is illegal to drive any vehicle (including bicycles and kick scooters) under the influence of any amount of alcohol, and violations over .03% are heavily punished. However up to .02&#160;% is usually tolerated as it can be naturally occurring. Traffic fines for small offences can be paid on the spot. Large offences (drunk driving, more than 40 (town)/50 (rural) km/h over limit, etc.) require an administrative hearing and you may be required to pay a large deposit and/or your driving license can be suspended. In criminal offences which would result in a trial (eg. heavily drunk or drugged driving, car chase, etc.), your car can be seized. Some police cars (mostly on highways) accept payment by cards yet most don't.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_bicycle\">By bicycle</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32\" title=\"Edit section: By bicycle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Czech Republic is an excellent place for cycling. There are lots of pleasant country roads, cycling marked paths and picturesque villages along these paths (always with a pub).

Try cycling in <a href=\"/en/South_Moravia\" title=\"South Moravia\">South Moravia</a> (close to the Austrian border) where you can find dozens of well-marked paths that will lead you through beautiful countryside full of vineyards, wine cellars and colourful villages.\n</p><p>The border mountain ranges (Krkono\u0161e, \u0160umava, Jesen\u00edky etc.) are growing in popularity among mountain-bikers. There are usually no fences along the trails but always keep to the roads or marked cycling paths here as these mountains are national parks or reserves and you can be fined if you cycle \"off the beaten track\".\n</p><p>Beware that drunk cycling is illegal and, although quite common, the police do routine checks (especially on paved cycling paths).

These maps are based on military maps and are very accurate. It's also possible to go by train to a small village at the edge of a forest and find the onsite map of the surrounding area, and four possible paths will be visible, marked in red, yellow, green, and blue on tourist maps. These coloured directing signs are posted on trees, displaying three short horizontal bars, the outer two are white and the innermost the colour of the path you're on, pointing the direction of any of the coloured paths.

The <b><a href=\"/en/Slovak_phrasebook\" title=\"Slovak phrasebook\">Slovak</a></b> language can also frequently be heard, especially in larger Czech cities, as there is a sizable Slovak minority within the republic, and both languages are mostly mutually intelligible to each other. Czechs are proud of their language, and thus, even in Prague, you will not find many signs written in English outside of the main tourist areas. Many older people, especially outside the larger cities, are unable to converse in English, so it's good to learn some Czech words or phrases before your arrival. However, most young people speak at least some English, as it has been taught in schools since 1990.\n</p><p>Many Czechs speak a second and often a third language. English is the most widely known, especially among younger people. German is arguably the second most widely spoken language among older people. Russian was taught extensively under communist rule, meaning most people born before 1975 speak, read, or understand at least some Russian (and often pretty well). However, the connection with the communist era and the Soviet-led invasion of 1968 (as well as with contemporary Russian mafia gangs) have given the language some negative connotations. Russian is also not very useful with younger people, as it is not, despite the common misconception, mutually intelligible with Czech beyond some similar words and phrases. Other languages, like French and Spanish, are also taught in some schools, yet you should not count on them being widely understood. Czechs also understand basic words or simple sentences in other related Slavic languages, including Polish, Ukrainian, Serbo-Croatian, and Slovenian.\n</p><p>Czech can be extremely difficult for English-speakers to grasp, as it's not an easy language to learn, and takes extreme patience and practice to master, especially if one is unfamiliar with other Slavic languages. However, if you can learn the alphabet and its corresponding letters with accents, then pronunciation is easy, as Czech is a highly phonetic language, with the stress falling on the first syllable. The concentration of consonants in many words could seem mind-bogglingly hard to pronounce at first, but it is worth the effort! Czechs highly appreciate foreigners who try to learn their language, even if it is only a few phrases or simple words.\n</p><p>Czech has many local dialects and accents, especially in Moravia and parts of Czech Silesia. Some dialects are so different that they can be sometimes misunderstood even by native Czechs from a different region. However, all Czechs understand Common Czech (as spoken on TV, radio, newspapers, and taught in schools) and should be able to speak it (but some remain too proud to stop using their local accent). Some are even unable to speak Common Czech, but still can write it correctly.\n</p><p>Compared to Czech, <a href=\"/en/Slovak_phrasebook\" title=\"Slovak phrasebook\">Slovak</a> uses softer pronunciation with different accents and letters. While Czech and Slovak grammar and vocabulary retain many similarities, there are occasional words that have different meanings. To the bemoaning of older generations, many young Czechs and Slovaks born after the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia have difficulties understanding each other.\n</p><p>In cities like Prague and <a href=\"/en/Karlovy_Vary\" title=\"Karlovy Vary\">Karlovy Vary</a>, <a href=\"/en/Russian_phrasebook\" title=\"Russian phrasebook\">Russian</a> is also sometimes overheard, due to the fairly significant Russian diaspora living in both cities. More recent arrivals by Ukrainian immigrants have also brought <a href=\"/en/Ukrainian_phrasebook\" title=\"Ukrainian phrasebook\">their language</a>, and it can frequently be heard in the larger Bohemian and Moravian cities. <a href=\"/en/Polish_phrasebook\" title=\"Polish phrasebook\">Polish</a> is sometimes heard in the Zaolzie border region in <a href=\"/en/North_Moravia\" title=\"North Moravia\">North Moravia</a>, particularly around <a href=\"/en/Karvina\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Karvina\">Karvina</a> and \u010cesk\u00fd T\u011b\u0161\u00edn, where bilingual street, building, and road signs are commonplace. One of the country's most prolific immigrant groups, the Vietnamese, own many small grocery stores and corner shops (<i>potraviny</i>) across the country, as well as many Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese restaurants. This group commonly speaks <a href=\"/en/Vietnamese_phrasebook\" title=\"Vietnamese phrasebook\">Vietnamese</a> to each other in their stores or on the street, although many also speak heavily-accented Czech. Younger Vietnamese have completely integrated into Czech society, and are often bi or trilingual with Czech, Vietnamese, and English.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Buy\">Buy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37\" title=\"Edit section: Buy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Buy\" title=\"click to add a buy listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '37', 'buy', 'Czech_Republic');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:CZK_Banknotes_2014.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/CZK_Banknotes_2014.png/300px-CZK_Banknotes_2014.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"206\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/CZK_Banknotes_2014.png/450px-CZK_Banknotes_2014.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/07/CZK_Banknotes_2014.png/600px-CZK_Banknotes_2014.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"670\" data-file-height=\"461\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:CZK_Banknotes_2014.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Czech koruna banknotes.</div></div></div>\n<p>The currency of the Czech Republic is the <b>koruna</b> (crown), plural <b>koruny</b> or <b>korun</b>.

In shopping areas along the Austrian border and petrol stations in the whole country, change can be given in euros, but supermarkets and similar stores in downtown Prague (and other cities) will return only koruna, even though they may accept euros.\n</p><p>Money exchange offices (<i>sm\u011bn\u00e1rna</i>) are commonly found across the country, mostly in larger towns and cities. However, <b>never exchange money on the street</b>, as it is illegal and usually a scam (and you may easily end up with counterfeit or foreign banknotes). It is possible to exchange money in banks, although commission charges are often attached. Be very careful when you are exchanging money at small exchange kiosks. Some of them try to use tricks in order to give you a bad exchange rate (eg. the displayed very good exchange rates are valid for transactions over 50,000CZK / 2000\u20ac only). Ask for the total amount you will get and recompute it by yourself. Beware that once you hand over your money, it is legally a binding offer and it is very hard to cancel the transaction if you don't have strong arguments that they cheated. Do not trust \"0% commission\" in big letters signs either, as often there is an \"only when selling CZK\" amendment in small letters, and buying CZK still includes a commision. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.exchange.cz/\">Exchange</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.xe.com/\">XE.com</a> offer up to date exchange rates for nearly all currencies.\n</p><p>Generally, exchange offices at the airport, rail stations and main tourist areas do not offer good rates.

Citizens from non-EU states will need a work visa or a business license. The easiest way to live and work in the Czech Republic as an English speaking person is to teach English.

This is more than enough to live comfortably with, depending on your living situation or lifestyle.\n</p><p>In order to work in the Czech Republic, you must either obtain a work visa or a trade certificate (<i>\u017eivnostensk\u00fd list</i>). A work visa, usually sponsored by your company, allows you to work for one business and normally requires a university degree. A trade certificate, however, does not require a degree, but does requires an initial bank account balance in excess of 110,000CZK ($5,100 roughly), a valid ID or passport, a recent criminal record from your home country, and a small fee to purchase. After obtaining it, a <i>\u017eivnostensk\u00fd list</i> allows you to work as a freelancer, doing whatever you wish. In order to apply for a trade license, you must go to a city office (<i>m\u011bstsk\u00fd \u00fa\u0159ad</i>), where there will typically be a trade license office (<i>\u017eivnostensk\u00fd odbor</i>).

However, nothing goes as well with an excellent Czech beer as some of the best examples of traditional Czech cuisine, like pork, duck, or goose with dumplings and sauerkraut.\n</p><p>A traditional main meal for a day (usually lunch) consists of two or three dishes.

The third, optional part is either something sweet (and coffee) or a small vegetable salad.\n</p><p>Czech cuisine offers many different kinds of soup (<i>pol\u00e9vka</i>).

Typical combinations with potato dumplings are roasted meat (pork or lamb for example) with spinach, or duck with sauerkraut (with a combination of <i>bramborov\u00e9</i> and <i>houskov\u00e9 knedl\u00edky</i>). Less common are <b>chlupat\u00e9 knedl\u00edky</b> (literally hairy dumplings but there is no hair on it, don't panic) which are not sliced but boiled in the shape of balls. They are also usually served with roasted meat and either sauerkraut or spinach.\n</p><p>Other Czech dishes include <b>pe\u010den\u00e1 kachna</b>, roast duck again served with bread or potato dumplings, and red and white sauerkraut; <b>moravsk\u00fd vrabec</b> (lit. Moravian sparrow) which is in fact pork cooked in garlic and onions; <b>sma\u017een\u00fd kapr</b>, fried carp breaded and served with a very rich potato salad and eaten on Christmas Eve; <b>pe\u010den\u00e9 vep\u0159ov\u00e9 koleno</b>, roast pork knee, served with mustard and fresh horseradish; <b>brambor\u00e1k</b>, garlicky potato pancakes; <b>sma\u017een\u00fd s\u00fdr</b>, breaded deep-fried Eidam (Edammer; the most popular cheese in the Czech Republic) served with boiled potatoes or french fries and tartar sauce; <b>p\u00e1rek v rohl\u00edku</b>, long, thin hot dogs with crusty rolls and mustard or ketchup.  If you must, you can always get <b>hranolky</b> - french fries.  And of course, the ubiquitous <b>zel\u00ed</b> (raw cabbage or sauerkraut) which is served with absolutely everything.  Game is also very good, and includes dishes such as <b>kan\u010d\u00ed</b>, wild boar, <b>ba\u017eant</b>, pheasant, and <b>srn\u010d\u00ed</b>, <b>jelen\u00ed</b> or <b>da\u0148\u010d\u00ed</b>, all species of deer.

These are actually potato wedges, usually spiced and served very hot.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Meals_atypical_for_restaurants\">Meals atypical for restaurants</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=50\" title=\"Edit section: Meals atypical for restaurants\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Generally, the best place try Czech cuisine is to be invited for such a meal at someone's house. However, it is not so easy as contemporary Czechs tend to prepare simpler and more international foods. Traditional Czech cuisine is often reserved for Sundays, holidays, or prepared by grandma (<i>babi\u010dka</i>) when her children visit. This isn't a rule but a common situation. In normal restaurants\u2014even the better ones\u2014traditional Czech staples can't match what grandma serves. This doesn't mean that the food is bad or not tasty, but it is missing something that home preparation can provide. In luxurious restaurants specialized with Czech cuisine, food can be excellent, but the luxurious style and creative improvements by the chef often only mimics traditional folk cuisine. Again, this is not a hard rule. Sometimes you can compliment the food in a restaurant that is  \"like what my grandma makes.\"\n</p><p>There are some dishes that are usually not served in any restaurants or pubs, but are made at home and worth trying if you have the opportunity. <b>Brambory na loupa\u010dku</b> (potatoes to be peeled) is a cheap and simple meal usually made in the countryside. Whole unpeeled potatoes are boiled in a big pot and put in the pot itself or a bowl on the table. You just take a hot potato from the pot, peel it yourself, put some salt, butter, and/or curd (<i>tvaroh</i>) on it and eat it. Drink it down with lots of cold milk. For such a simple meal, it can be incredibly tasty, especially when eaten in the countryside after a day spent outside.\n</p><p>Mushroom-picking in forests is a very popular activity among Czechs. Unsurprisingly, collected mushrooms are eaten afterwards. In restaurants, usually only cultivated mushrooms are used. If forest mushrooms are served in a restaurant, it is usually only as a minor addition to a meal. Homemade mushroom meals are a completely different story. A classic example is <b>sma\u017eenice</b> (fried dish), also known as <b>m\u00edchanice</b> (mixed dish)\u2014forest mushrooms, the more kinds the better, are sliced into small pieces, mixed and stewed with some fat, onion, and caraway. Later, eggs are added to the mixture. Sma\u017eenice is served with bread. <b>Sma\u017een\u00e9 bedly</b> are whole caps of parasol mushrooms coated in breadcrumbs and cumin and fried. <b>\u010cern\u00fd kuba</b> (black Jimmy) is a traditional Christmas fasting meal made from dried mushrooms and peeled barley. <b>Houbov\u00e1 om\u00e1\u010dka</b> (mushroom sauce), served with meat and bread dumplings is also popular. Fresh or dried mushrooms make also a nice addition to <b>brambora\u010dka s houbami</b> (potato soup with mushrooms). <b>Kulajda</b> is a soup from mushrooms and cream. Soups and sauces are the most likely forest mushroom meals to find in a restaurant, because they contain a relatively small amount of mushrooms.\n</p><p>If you want to pick mushrooms by yourself, be careful. There are hundreds of species, some of them tasty, some merely edible, but some poisonous or even deadly. You can also find psilocybin, which are hallucinogenic (although it is very hard to guess a safe dosage and therefore dangerous). A tasty and edible species may look very similar to bitter or deadly species. If you do not know mushrooms very well, you should be accompanied by an experienced mushroom-picker.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Snacks\">Snacks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=51\" title=\"Edit section: Snacks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Also try a traditional snack, often the only food served in some pubs (<i>hospoda</i>, <i>pivnice</i>), or can be found in bread shops (<i>pek\u00e1rna</i>).

Remember, real Czech beer is only served on tap; bottled beer is a completely different experience. High-quality beer can almost certainly be found in a <i>hospoda</i> or <i>hostinec</i>, very basic pubs which serve only beer and light snacks. Take a seat and order your drinks when the waiter comes to you. But beware, the handling of the beer is even more important than its brand. A bad bartender can completely ruin even excellent beer. The best bet is to ask local beer connoisseurs about a good pub or just join them.\n</p><p>Beers are sometimes listed by their original sugar content, which is measured in degrees Plato (P/\u00b0). The difference is generally apparent in the final alcohol content. Normal beer is about 10\u00b0 (such as Gambrinus and Staropramen, which results in 4% ABV), lager 12\u00b0 (such as Pilsner Urquell, results in about 4.75% ABV). The latter is stronger and more expensive, so you should specify which one you want when you order.\n</p><p>Czech lager is nothing like the fizzy lagers found in many other countries. Instead, it has a very strong, hoppy, almost bitter flavour, and goes very well with heavy dishes like duck or pork and dumplings or strong cheeses. It always has a thick head on the top when it is served, but do not be afraid to drink \"through\" it, it is fun and it slowly disappears anyway, nevertheless do not drink the beer too slowly as the fresh cold taste (especially in hot summers) quickly fades &#8211; the \"true\" Czech connoisseurs do not even finish this \"tepid goat,\" as they call it.\n</p><p>Don't be surprised if the waiter, especially in typical pub, puts the next beer before you, but you have not ordered it and also you have not finished your previous beer. It is purely and simply because you shouldn't sit in a pub with empty glass. If you don't want another beer, say <i>ne, d\u011bkuji</i> (\"no, thanks\") to the waiter, or <i>zaplatim pros\u00edm</i> (\"i will pay, please\") if you want to pay and leave.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wine\">Wine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=60\" title=\"Edit section: Wine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>What might come as a surprise to beer-loving outsiders, wine (<i>v\u00edno</i>) is also highly popular in the Czech Republic, particularly in <a href=\"/en/South_Moravia\" title=\"South Moravia\">South Moravia</a>, where the climate is suited for vineyards. White wines tend to be the best, as the growing conditions are more favourable for them. For white wines, try <b>Veltl\u00ednsk\u00e9 zelen\u00e9</b> (Green Veltliner), <b>Mu\u0161k\u00e1t moravsk\u00fd</b> (Moravian Muscatel), <b>Ryzlink r\u00fdnsk\u00fd</b> (Rhine Riesling) or <b>Tram\u00edn</b> (Traminer), or red wines such as <b>Frankovka</b> (Blaufrankisch), <b>Modr\u00fd Portugal</b> (Blue Portugal, named after the grape, not the country), or <b>Svatovav\u0159ineck\u00e9</b> (Saint Lawrence).

Unsurprisingly, as beer is the national drink, it is usually the cheapest thing on the menu, with prices ranging from 15 to 60CZK (0.50&#8211;2\u20ac) per half litre, depending on the attractiveness or location the pub. Pubs closer to well-known tourist centres often have more expensive beer. Drinks are brought to your table, and often each drink is marked on a small slip of paper which is kept on the table in front of you, so you can keep count of what you have had. When you are ready to leave, ask the waiter for the bill &#8211; he or she will calculate the bill according to the number of marks on the paper.  It is common to share tables in busy pubs, with most Czechs asking <i>Je tu volno?</i> (\"Is this seat free?\") before sitting down.\n</p><p>Try also <b>sva\u0159\u00e1k</b>, a hot mulled wine served in all pubs and outdoors at Christmas markets, and is the Slavic cousin to the German <i>gl\u00fchwein</i>. <b>Grog</b>, hot rum and water served with a slice of lemon (add sugar to taste), and <b>medovina</b> (mead) are both usually served hot and are particularly good for warming up at a cold winter market. Finally, if you are heading into Moravia, try <b>bur\u010d\u00e1k</b>, a speciality found only around the end of the summer or early autumn. It is extremely young wine, usually white, and is in a cloudy, still fermenting stage of production when the wine is very sweet and smooth to drink. It continues to ferment in the stomach, so the alcoholic content at the time of serving is unknown, but it's usually high and can creep up on its drinkers due to its sweetness hiding its potency. Czechs say that it should only be drunk fresh from the vineyard, and many small private winemakers are passionate about it, waiting up into the night for the moment when the wine reaches the <i>\"bur\u010d\u00e1k\"</i> stage. Visitors will often spot it being sold at wine festivals (<i>vinobrani</i>) around the country, as well as sometimes in markets or wine bars (<i>vinoteka</i>).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_safe\">Stay safe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=64\" title=\"Edit section: Stay safe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Law enforcement is carried out by the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.policie.cz/clanek/Police-of-the-Czech-Republic.aspx\">Policie \u010cesk\u00e9 republiky</a>.

Police officers are largely respected, and will be mainly helpful to tourists in need.\n</p><p>The European <b>unified emergency number 112</b> functions in the Czech Republic and will work for all land or mobile lines.

The country is remarkably safe and free of personal crime. However, there are several nuisances that travellers should be aware of:\n</p>\n<dl><dt>Taxi drivers</dt>\n<dd>Negotiate the price before you use taxi or use a reputable company (e.g. in Prague AAA taxi, Profi Taxi, City Taxi). Prague taxi drivers are notorious known for taking the longest possible way to earn more money or to use so-called \u201cturbos\u201d which speeds the meter up (the control is usually hidden under the gear stick gaiter). The Prague City Council has introduced new regulations which will see all legitimate taxis painted yellow. Public transportation in most major cities is often reliable and inexpensive, many of them with night services.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Pickpockets</dt>\n<dd>Watch your pockets, especially if there is a crowd, particularly in <a href=\"/en/Prague\" title=\"Prague\">Prague</a>. Watch out for large groups of people jostling you. Beware of a particular pickpocket gangs operating in Prague: they are mainly male, although sometimes there are women too; all are extremely overweight and rely on their sheer size and number to disorientate tourists. They tend to operate on the 9, 10 and 22 trams as well as the central metro stations, usually just as people are getting on and off, or on the escalators. Don't pull out your tickets unless you are specifically asked to do so. Keep your wallet and money securely locked and separate from each other at all time. Don't challenge them as they can become aggressive but keep your eyes open. Prosecutions for pickpocketing are rare as the police usually have to catch the pickpocket in the middle of a crime, otherwise the gang members just blame each other and it is impossible to prove who did it.</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Prostitution</dt>\n<dd>Prostitution is not a legal business but not illegal either. This means prostitutes do not pay taxes and prostitution is not regulated by the state. Therefore the health risk may be very high, especially in cheap brothels (often spotted with red lights on their windows) or on the street. There also have been cases of prostitutes offering a drink with sleeping pills to their customers and then stealing everything. Pay attention to the age of the prostitute, as paying a person under 18 years for sex is a criminal offense (otherwise the age of consent is 15).</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt>Marijuana</dt>\n<dd>Marijuana is illegal in the Czech Republic but it is quite popular, especially among young people. In case the police catches you smoking or possessing marijuana, be very polite with them. The reason is that by the current law, punishable is only possession of a \u201clarger than small\u201d amount of marijuana (defined as 15 g) but if you are rude, they may detain and interrogate you, asking for your source.</dd></dl>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=65\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Grocery stores do not sell what many Americans consider <b>over-the-counter drugs</b>, such as aspirin. You will need to go to a pharmacy (<i>l\u00e9k\u00e1rna</i>), which is usually open between 8AM and 7PM, Mondays to Fridays. There are 24-hour pharmacies in the bigger cities, and you should find an address for the closest one to you listed in the window of the nearest pharmacy to you. If you are in Prague, the most central 24-hour one is in Prague 2, on the corner of Belgick\u00e1 and Rumunsk\u00e1 streets. These pharmacies dispense both prescription and non-prescription drugs from a small window on Rumunsk\u00e1 out of hour. Ring the bell if there is no-one there.\n</p><p><b>Tap water</b> is good and perfectly safe across the country, although in some small towns, the chlorine can be quite strong.\n</p><p>A reputable hospital in Prague is <b>Nemocnice na Homolce'<i>. There is a foreigner's clinic (</i>cizineck\u00e9 odd\u011blen\u00ed</b>) with English-speaking receptionists who can make appointments for you. Most doctors speak some English, and the level of care is of a very high standard.\n</p><p>Central Europe and parts of the Czech Republic have <b>ticks</b> (<i>Ixodes ricinus</i>) which can carry Encephalitis or Lyme Borreliosis. Ticks hide in grass and bushes, so try to stay on trails and inspect exposed areas of skin after a hike. Vaccination against Encephalitis is available and recommended. If you want to bushwhack, make sure you have the vaccination and wear long trousers. A good insect repellent (which contains DEET), might be helpful, too.\nTicks like to cling to any soft, warm, well-perfused areas of your body (undersides of knees and elbows, skin around ankles, groins, neck area, behind your ears etc.) and if not removed, they'll suck your blood until they grow about 1 cm big. Never try to scratch a tick off or pull it out, because damaging it can cause you a serious infection. The sooner the tick is removed, the smaller the chance of infection. Either ask a physician to remove a tick for you, or try to remove it by yourself: lubricate your finger with any greasy lotion and gently wag a tick from side to side until it wobbles free. Then flush it down the drain - never crush or burn it to avoid infection. Watch the affected spot: if you see a growing red spot developing there anytime during next several months, immediately visit your physician and tell him about that - you might have contracted Borreliosis. It is dangerous, but it can be easily treated with antibiotics during early stage. Be wary that American vaccination against Borreliosis most probably won't work against European strains (<i>B. afzelii</i> and <i>B. garini</i>). Note that ticks are sometimes present even in city parks, including Prague.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Respect\">Respect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=66\" title=\"Edit section: Respect\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Hanacky_kroj.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Hanacky_kroj.jpg/300px-Hanacky_kroj.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Hanacky_kroj.jpg/450px-Hanacky_kroj.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Hanacky_kroj.jpg/600px-Hanacky_kroj.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1600\" data-file-height=\"1197\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Hanacky_kroj.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Moravians in traditional costumes.</div></div></div>\n<p>The Czech Republic, along with its neighbours <a href=\"/en/Slovakia\" title=\"Slovakia\">Slovakia</a>, <a href=\"/en/Austria\" title=\"Austria\">Austria</a>, <a href=\"/en/Poland\" title=\"Poland\">Poland</a> and <a href=\"/en/Germany\" title=\"Germany\">Germany</a>, is part of <a href=\"/en/Central_Europe\" title=\"Central Europe\">Central Europe</a>.

The name still has yet to universally be accepted or agreed upon.    \n</p><p>Czechs don't appreciate foreigners who incorrectly assume their country was historically part of the Soviet Union or the Russian Empire\u2014both entirely false\u2014although it was part of the Soviet-led Eastern Bloc, and was until 1918 a part of Austro-Hungarian Empire. Czechs also don't appreciate it when foreigners confuse their country's name with the turbulent Russian republic of <a href=\"/en/Chechnya\" title=\"Chechnya\">Chechnya</a>. Additionally, calling the country \"Czechoslovakia\" still will not cause any offence to most locals but rather laughs, as Czechoslovakia has not existed for decades. \n</p><p>If you are knowledgeable about the Czechoslovak communist regime following World War II, bear in mind that this is still a sensitive issue for many. Most readily admit the positive social programmes of the era, yet a majority of Czechs born after 1960 and 1970 have otherwise few romantic views of Communism due to the experience of Normalisation. Although many complain about the state of the Czech Republic's affairs today, there is little nostalgia with younger generations to return to the old days. However, unlike neighbouring former Eastern Bloc states like <a href=\"/en/Poland\" title=\"Poland\">Poland</a>, <a href=\"/en/Hungary\" title=\"Hungary\">Hungary</a>, or the <a href=\"/en/Baltic_states\" title=\"Baltic states\">Baltics</a>, where Communism is near universally reviled, a relatively strong number of elderly Czechs still retain fond memories of the old order, partially explaining the continual popularity of the KS\u010cM, the country's successor Communist party, which has maintained 10 to 15% of parliament throughout various elections since 1990. Dogmatically Marxist, fiercely conservative and viewed as a protest party, the KS\u010cM and its members hold largely anti-Western (and sometimes outright xenophobic) views, although few of it's members speak English, it is doubtful you will have any contact with them unless you are interested in left-wing politics.    \n</p><p>Centuries of religious skepticism, forced Catholicisation, and the most recent experience of Communism have made Czechs some the most atheistic people in the world, and will often not hesitate to say that they don't believe in any God. This is true especially in large Bohemian cities. Don't assume that anyone you do not know believes in God or has a passion for Christianity. Many Czechs find Mormon missionaries, Jehovah's Witnesses, and street preaching in general as a disrespectful and foreign presence in their country. Respect people's disbelief in religion and your religion will also be respected. Despite the country's largely atheist views, nearly 10% of the Czech Republic remains Catholic (although their numbers are declining), with another 1% Protestant. There are also small Jewish, Buddhist and Islamic minorities, mostly located in Prague. Despite religious disbelief being a majority, holidays such as Easter, Jan Hus Day, St. Cyril and Methodius Day, and Christmas are still widely celebrated, although most Czechs confess they do so for strictly cultural reasons and not for religious ones. \n</p><p>Always say hello (<i>dobr\u00fd den</i>) and goodbye (<i>na shledanou</i>, half-formally <i>nashle</i>) when you enter and leave a small shop, restaurant or pub as it is polite.\n</p><p>While dining at a restaurant with a host family, it is customary for THEM to pick up the bill, the opposite of most Western standards.

Depending on how traditional the host family are, they may insist you change immediately into house shoes as a hygiene precaution, though this is rare. At the very least, they will offer you some to keep your feet warm.\n</p><p>It is advised not to mention Czech towns and places with their former German names, when asking for directions (e.g. referring to <i>Karlsbad</i> instead of Karlovy Vary etc.) or while chatting with the locals. Czechs will be offended and they will regard it as ignorance and a lack of respect towards themselves. Many older Czechs are particularly sensitive about the latter while the younger usually won't know the differences. As a rule of thumb, try using the Czech names. You should avoid using the word \"Sudeten\" or \"Sudetenland,\" especially when visiting that region, unless a Czech person will say it first.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Moravia\">Moravia</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Czech_Republic&amp;action=edit&amp;section=67\" title=\"Edit section: Moravia\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The vast majority of Moravians will take no offence to being called Czechs, and consider themselves to be both.

The first wave were of the <b>Saladoid-Barrancoid</b> group, farmers, fishermen, and ceramists who arrived by canoe from Venezuela's Orinoco Valley around 350&#160;AD. The <b>Arawak</b> people were the second wave, arriving from South America around 800&#160;AD. Arawak settlements on the island include Stroud Point, Chandler Bay, Saint Luke's Gully, and Mapp's Cave. According to accounts by descendants of the aboriginal Arawak tribes on other local islands, the original name for Barbados was Ichirouganaim. In the 13th century, the <b>Caribs</b> arrived from South America in the third wave, displacing both the Arawak and the Salodoid-Barrancoid. For the next few centuries, they lived in isolation on the island.\n</p><p>The name \"Barbados\" comes from a Portuguese explorer named Pedro Campos in 1536, who originally called the island Os Barbados (\"The Bearded Ones\"), after the appearance of the island's fig trees, whose long hanging aerial roots resembled beards. Between Campos's sighting in 1536 and 1550, Spanish conquistadors seized many Caribs on Barbados and used them as slave labor on plantations. The others fled the island, moving elsewhere.\n</p><p>Barbados was formally settled by the <b>British</b> in 1627. After several failed crops of cotton, sugarcane was introduced, and the colony established itself as a profitable plantation economy. Enslaved <b>Africans</b> were the primary source of labour on these plantations until 1834, when they won their freedom through several years of rebellion, supported by increasing pressure from anti-slavery movements in Britain. \n</p><p>The economy remained heavily dependent on sugar, rum and molasses production through most of the 20th century. Though the shackles were removed, much of the repressive labour conditions of slavery remained on the island until the 1930s, when the educated black middle class fought for universal adult suffrage and took the control of the country's local governance away from the British-descended local aristocracy. The country began a process of social and political reforms in the 1940s and 1950s which led to complete independence from the United Kingdom in 1966. In the 1980s, tourism and manufacturing surpassed the sugar industry in economic importance. Barbados has developed into a stable democracy with one of the highest rates of literacy in the Western Hemisphere.\n</p><p>Locals refer to themselves as <i>Bajans</i> and things Barbadian as <i>Bajan</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Barbados&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Barbados_region_map.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d8/Barbados_region_map.png/600px-Barbados_region_map.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"721\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d8/Barbados_region_map.png/900px-Barbados_region_map.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d8/Barbados_region_map.png/1200px-Barbados_region_map.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"2500\" data-file-height=\"3005\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Barbados_region_map.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Map of Barbados with regions colour-coded</div></div></div>\n<p>The island of Barbados has eleven parishes which can be sensibly divided into four regions:\n</p>\n<div id=\"region_list\">\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#d5dc76\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Bridgetown\" title=\"Bridgetown\">Bridgetown</a></b> <br />the capital city of Barbados and surrounding areas in Saint Michael Parish.\n</td></tr></table>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#71b37b\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Central_Eastern_Barbados\" title=\"Central Eastern Barbados\">Central Eastern Barbados</a></b> <br />the parishes of Saint Andrew, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Joseph and Saint Thomas.

The bus system is extensive, cheap and fast if you are headed to somewhere on the main route, but a car (or mini-moke) is the only way to see many of the out-of-the-way sights. Many drivers will hold a bus for you if they see you are from out of town, reflecting the typical welcoming spirit. Buses are run by the Barbados Transport Board (blue) and are quiet. Private operators include the yellow buses, which play very loud music, and private mini-vans (white), which are usually cramped and crowded. The two privately run means of transport are often driven very fast and recklessly. All charge the same fare (BBD2.00). Yellow buses and minivans offer change and even accept US dollars. BTB buses accept Barbados dollars and do not give change.\n</p><p>There are also more than enough taxis to take you wherever you need to go on the island for reasonable prices. They do not use meters and it is best to negotiate the price before you get in. However, most taxi drivers are honest and you are unlikely to be overcharged. Be sure to ask the management of the hotel or the friendly locals what the going rate is for a cab ride to your destination.\n</p><p>Renting a car is expensive. If you are driving, be aware that the roads on the island are generally quite narrow, with the exception of the ABC highway.  It is advisable to be extra cautious as many roads on the island have sharp turns, steep inclines, and are generally quite bumpy, although most are paved.\n</p><p>Many of these \"highways\" do not have sidewalks, so there can be pedestrians on the street sharing the road. Many bus stops are also on the side of roads where there are no sidewalks. Additionally, beware of impromptu passing lanes as slow drivers are often passed by others behind them when on two lane roads. Road signs can be fairly confusing, so be prepared to get lost: just keep your petrol tank topped up and keep asking the way as people are always eager to help.\n</p><p>At most all of the local car rental agencies, a full collision damage waiver policy is automatically included with the rental, except for any damage incurred to the car tires, a testament to the poor condition of the smaller roads and tendency of foreign drivers to miscalculate driving lanes and hit curbs.\n</p><p>Mopeds and bikes can also be rented to explore sites not easily reached by cars. This not recommended however due to the poor condition of many of the secondary and residential roads. Except for the main highway, all the other roads provide a hazardous journey to the moped or bike rider due to no sidewalks, frequent pot holes, sharp corners and speeding local buses.\n</p><p>Another fun way to get around is to rent a moke available from any number of local car rental agencies.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Talk\">Talk</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Barbados&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Talk\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The official language in Barbados is English.

The exchange rate is fixed at about 2 Bajan dollars to the US dollar. Keep in mind that exchangers in hotels and banks may take an additional percentage of the exchange (typically 5%).\n</p><p>ATMs are widely available, although many banks ATMs charge up to 5 USD fee to withdraw cash using international cards. The only bank chain that does not seem to charge is the Republic Bank, which advertises its \"Blue Machines\" which are easy to spot.\n</p><p>Many \"duty free\" shops cater to visitors: from cruise ships. Bridgetown's main street hosts numerous jewellers, most frequently Colombian Emeralds and Diamonds International. Cave Shepherd department store offers a wide range of mercantile, while Harrison's offers premium gifts, leathers and cosmetics. Other smaller stores offer virtually everything a visitor or resident might need. A small mall at the harbour also offers decent prices and selection (for rum and UK liquors), but goods produced in Barbados may be slightly more expensive there than elsewhere on the island.\n</p><p>Barbados has a well-deserved reputation for producing excellent rum, e.g., Mount Gay.

They in fact pay duty on imported goods before offering them for sale. But as they sell anything to you as a visitor, they will ask you to sign a form that allows them to get a refund of the duty paid. The government is working on a law that allows vendors to obtain goods that are intended for visitors without paying duty.\n</p><p><b>Business hours</b>:\n</p><p>In times past, most everything shut down on weekends, and visitors had to plan ahead especially if self-catering. This is no longer the case. Clothing and gift stores open until 4pm or so (Sheraton Mall shops until 9:00pm) on Saturdays; very few are open on Sunday. Many supermarkets island-wide are open on Saturday and Sunday.\n</p><p>Bank holidays (such as Christmas, New Year's Day, Good Friday, Easter Sunday and Easter Monday) will find most if not all stores and banks and business houses closed. But stores attached to gas stations will have limited availability of basic items, and shops at the deep water harbor will be open if cruise ships are visiting. There are a few small family run groceries across the island that will open on bank holidays (or have a side door open) to serve their community.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eat\">Eat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Barbados&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: Eat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Eat\" title=\"click to add a eat listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '12', 'eat', 'Barbados');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Do flying fish fly?</b><br />\nYes and no.

It's wise for tourists to avoid certain high-risk activities like walking on secluded beaches, day or night, and walking in unfamiliar residential neighbourhoods or secluded areas away from main roads.\n</p><p>The most common kinds of crimes against tourists include taxi fraud, robbery, and shortchanging; however, rape and assaults are becoming more common. Most Bajans are by nature friendly, especially in the earlier part of the tourist season (November and December).\n</p><p>A special area of concern for visitors to Barbados is drugs. The country's strict antidrug policy is made apparent to visitors coming through Customs. In practice, however, Europeans and Americans in Barbados are offered marijuana or even cocaine frequently. Sellers will often roam the beaches selling aloe vera or other such innocuous goods as a pretense to begin a conversation about \"ganja,\" \"smoke\" or \"bad habits.\" As a result, many hotels and resorts now ban the use of aloe vera under the pretense that it \"stains the towels.\"\n</p><p>Regardless of one's inclination to use drugs, it is not advisable to accept these offers. Marijuana is considered bad and is not accepted by Bajan police. While Bajan police are not frequently encountered, they prosecute drug crimes easily.\n</p><p>Care should also be taken going into the sea. Many people underestimate just how powerful the currents can be and rip tides have claimed lives over the years. Always look out for warning flags.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Barbados&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Beware of the sun, Barbados is only 13 degrees off of the equator and you can get sun burnt very easily. It is very important to keep your water intake high. Drink plenty of water or bring an umbrella to shade yourself against the sun, which is commonly done in the country.\n</p><p>Dengue is prevalent, therefore it is advisable to put on bug spray, as mosquitoes are often a nuisance to anyone staying outdoors for prolonged periods, day or night, as soon as you are in the country side.

A bikini will not be appreciated in town and certainly not in church.\n</p><p>Bajans are particularly sensitive to manners and saying, \"Good morning\" to people, even strangers, goes a long way to earning their respect.\n</p><p>When meeting a Bajan, try not to discuss politics or racial issues. Talk is also important because Barbadians speak fairly fast when speaking in Creole (or Bajan, as it is called).\n</p><p>The use of the \"N\" word is a <b>no</b>, but when talking to friends words such a \"B\" (which is short for \"bro\") and \"dawg\" are used to describe or refer to a friend. Initially these words should not be used unless you know the person well.\n</p><p>Most Bajans are fun-loving and love to go out and have fun, as is noted by the large number of young people found in the clubs and on the Southern Coast of the island. Try not to stare at persons without good cause. If you happen to bounce into someone in a club, you should immediately apologize to the person.\n</p><p>Keep in mind that Bajans are very protective of family, and insults to a person's family are taken very seriously. This also relates to their views on issues such as homosexuality; even though most Bajans do not agree with the practice, your rights are still respected.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact\">Contact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Barbados&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: Contact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are several small internet cafes located around the island as well as connections offered by the larger resort hotels.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<table width=\"60%\" bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" style=\"border-style:dotted;border-width:2px;border-color:lightblue\">\n<tr>\n<td><i>This <a href=\"/en/Wikitravel:What_is_an_article\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikitravel:What is an article\">article</a> is an <b><a href=\"/en/Wikitravel:Outline_articles\" title=\"Wikitravel:Outline articles\">outline</a></b> and needs more content.

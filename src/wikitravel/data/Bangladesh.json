Bangladesh officially came into existence in 1971 when Bengali-speaking Muslim-majority East Pakistan was allocated as a Pakistani colony seceded from its Union with Punjabi dominated populous <a href=\"/en/Pakistan\" title=\"Pakistan\">West Pakistan</a> after a 9 month bloody civil war between the former countrymen. Although Bangladesh emerged as an rebellious Independent country only in 1971, its history stretches back thousands of years and it has long been known as a crossroads of history and culture with Southeast Asia. Here you will find the world's longest beach, countless mosques, the largest mangrove forest in the world, interesting tribal villages and a wealth of elusive wild life. Although relatively impoverished compared to its burgeoning Southern Indoasian neighbour Republic of India, Bangladeshis are very friendly and hospitable people, putting personal hospitality before personal finances.\n</p><p>Ready-made garments, textiles, pharmaceuticals, agricultural goods, ship building and fishing are some of the largest industries. The gap between rich and poor is increasingly obvious and the middle-class is fast-shrinking, as in the rest of Southeast Asia, especially in cities such as Dhaka and Chittagong as you move around between the working class old city and affluent neighborhoods like Gulshan and Baridhara.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Climate\">Climate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Climate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Bangladesh has a sub tropical monsoon climate. There are  six seasons in a year: Winter (Dec-Jan), Spring (Feb-Mar), Summer (Apr-May), Monsoon (June-July), Autumn (Aug-Sep), and Late Autumn (Oct-Nov). The average temperature across the country usually ranges between 9C - 29C in winter months and between 21C - 34C during summer months. Annual rainfall varies from 160cm to 200cm in the West, 200cm to 400cm in the Southeast and 250cm to 400cm in the Northeast. Cyclones above category three/four are uncommon (especially in the deep winter January through March)-- but while rare, can still bring widespread disruption as expected to infrastructure and power outages, especially in the coastal areas. The weather pattern is akin to the Gulf Coast in the United States (Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana).\n</p><p>The current weather can be seen by hitting the 'play' button on the following interactive map, Current Bangladesh Satellite Weather Radar <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://amardeshbd.com/weather/weather.php\">[1]</a>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Landscape\">Landscape</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Landscape\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The country is primarily a low-lying plain of about 144,000 km<sup>2</sup>, situated on deltas of large rivers flowing from the Himalayas: the Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna to eventually empty into the Bay of Bengal.

However, this method is fairly unorthodox and is not available for the average traveller<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://resource.ogrlegal.com/bangladesh-visa/\">[2]</a>.\n</p><p>There is a flat visa fee of US $50, plus VAT of  BDT 7 (approx. $0.08). In reality they take $51 and somewhere along the line $0.92 gets pocketed. You must pay in USD, although the VAT can be paid in Taka. The whole procedure is now a all-in-one-place affair at the airport, which means upon arrival you will pass a special VoA section shortly before immigration. First you have to pay (if you don't have 1$/85Taka, the overpaid amount in $ will be given back in Taka to a pretty good exchange rate without commission), then you have to fill out an arrival card and a visa application form and then go to the visa counter. A hotel reservation OR a return ticket is obligatory for a tourist visa; be ready to show paperwork indicating invitations from the said government organisations. It would seem that they give you as long as you ask for, but probably with a 30 day maximum. After that you can pass through Immigration without queuing (!), but be aware of the final check guy at the exit behind the counters.\n</p><p>Since most passengers are either Bangladeshi or already have visas there is rarely a queue for VOA. Combined with a special VOA immigration lane, applying for a VOA might be quicker than arriving with a visa (for tourists only).\n</p><p>If you were a Bangladeshi citizen at some point in time and now hold a passport from a different country, you can contact your nearest Bangladesh High Commission for your \"No Visa Required\" stamp, which works as a permanent visa as long as your passport containing the stamp doesn't expire. This option is also available to the children and grandchildren Bangladeshi citizens.\n</p><p>If you apply in your home country you can usually obtain a 3 month visa if arriving by air, or 30 days if arriving at a land border crossing. Fees vary depending on nationality and length of visa requested.\n</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/en/File:As-flag.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"As-flag.png\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/As-flag.png/20px-As-flag.png\" width=\"20\" height=\"10\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/As-flag.png/30px-As-flag.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/As-flag.png/40px-As-flag.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"107\" data-file-height=\"54\" /></a> <b>Australian citizens</b> - All visas cost AU$150 from the Bangladesh High Commission in Canberra.

The state run Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.brtc.gov.bd/\">[33]</a> (BRTC) buses usually fall into this category. Avoid all of the low cost buses - they are easy to spot by their poor condition.  There are daily fatal accidents involving them. If you do use them, it is worth noting that they do not usually stop, but rather slow down slightly to let passengers on or off - you may have to simply jump off the bus (literally). If you do not speak the language, simply ask the driver for it or for small places the next big city \"behind\" your destination. If they go your direction, they will give you signal to get on the bus. Additionally, fare collectors, disconcertingly, do not wear uniform, but easy to identify: the one who holds lots of small cash in his hand.\n</p><p>However, there are luxurious air conditioned bus services connecting major cities and popular tourist destinations. Green Line <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.greenlineparibahan.com/\">[34]</a>, Shyamoli <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://shyamoli.paribahan.com/\">[35]</a>, SilkLine <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.paribahan.com/paribahan/silkline_browsers/silkline_main.php?\">[36]</a> and Shohagh <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.shohagh.com/group/\">[37]</a> usually have a couple different offices dotted around the cities they serve. Greenline has a few Scania buses running between Dhaka, Chittagong and Cox's Bazar that offer a level of comfort you've probably never seen in a bus before - they cost about 1/3 more than their Volvo buses, but are comparable to business class on an airplane, at least.  More comfortable and expensive buses use the same over crowded roads, and have the same suicidal drivers as the cheaper buses.  \n</p><p>Bus stations are often very busy and disorganized.  The main Sydabad station in Dhaka is extremely chaotic.  The approach to the \u201cstation\u201d can take many hours due to the lack of paved roads, street lights, traffic lights and decorum.  You should take care when having luggage stored in the hold of buses, even on the better carrier that will tag your bag.  Things do go missing (taken off early, or even, not loaded in the first place.  Make sure you out your suitcase in yourself, ideally first, so other luggage is in a thieves firing line.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_anything_else_with_wheels\">By anything else with wheels</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: By anything else with wheels\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The range of other public transport in Bangladesh is huge. Starting from Motorbikes, going to CNGs, electrified rickshaws, 3 wheeler or plattforms, that are pulled by a tractor engine. If you want to go somewhere, simply go on the side of the road that heads in the direction of your destination and flag down the next best thing that passes by and has already passengers inside. The last part is especially important, because locals believe that foreigners want to charter the whole ride, which is usually 10x the price. Expect to pay 5 to 10 Taka for anything electric powered and tractors; human powered rickshaws, motorbikes and CNGs are more expensive. Jump out (and pay), if the ride makes a turn into the \"wrong\" direction and get on the next.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Driving in Bangladesh is not for the faint hearted - the road network is fairly good, but dodging irrational bus drivers and weaving in and out of rickshaws isn't easy on the nerves. Driving standards are some of the worst in the world, as notable by the many cars which have bumper bars that encircle the whole car.  Traffic in Dhaka has reached unimaginable proportions, and self-driving is definitely not advised. Parking places are non-existent. It is highly advised to hire a local driver. Night time driving is substantially more dangerous as trucks/buses often ignore smaller cars; road travel at night should be avoided, regardless of who's driving.\n</p><p>Officially, cars drive on the left; in reality, cars drive on any side of the road. The speed limit is 25 km/h on all urban roads, though it is highly unlikely a vehicle will even reach this speed with the traffic. Many traffic lights have been installed in recent times, but these are often disregarded by both drivers and traffic police. Traffic police direct cars on all major intersections in urban areas. On many country roads, it is illegal to overtake; but again, this is completely ignored, with locals employing extremely dangerous manoeuvres when passing the vehicle in front of them. The cities are well lit, but country roads often lack street lighting. Some new inter-city roads have tolls, especially new bridges; these are fairly cheap.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_train_2\">By train</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: By train\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Bangladesh Railways</b> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.railway.gov.bd/\">[38]</a> is the state and only train operator.

However, due to the roundabout routes and tricky river crossings, the journey durations are usually much longer. Tickets can be booked over the phone, though unless you speak Bengali you're likely to get better results at one of the computerized station booking offices.\n</p><p>Trains are generally comfortable, with more leg room than buses. Though the carriages are generally not very clean, the AC and 1st class seats are manageable. <i>Sulob</i> class is the highest 2nd class ticket, with reserved seating and not much different from 1st class (except in price).\n</p><p>Kamlapur Rail Station in Dhaka is large and modern.

A journey along the river in any mode is probably the best way to see Bangladesh. There are a number of private tour operators offering river sightseeing trips of various lengths, or using the ferries to get between cities is a great way to see the country at a moderate pace.\n</p><p>The <b>Rocket Steamer</b> service connects <a href=\"/en/Dhaka\" title=\"Dhaka\">Dhaka</a> and <a href=\"/en/Khulna\" title=\"Khulna\">Khulna</a> via <a href=\"/en/Barisal\" title=\"Barisal\">Barisal</a>, and is a fantastic way to enjoy riverine Bangladesh, for those who prefer the scenic route.

It's advisable to book several days in advance if possible. While there are several different classes it's unlikely that you will end up in anything but 1st or 2nd class. Both of these consist of around 10 small berths on the upper deck of the boat with 2 beds each and a sink (no doubt doubling as a urinal), and fairly clean shared bathrooms. There's a central dining/sitting room in each class with a chef cooking Bengali meals and the odd fish-and-chips or an omelette for around Tk 50-150. Cheaper food can be bought at the vendors in the lower classes on the bottom level. First class is at the front of the boat, with the bow made into a nice sitting area. If you're traveling single you must book 2 beds if you want a berth guaranteed to yourself in either class, though unless the boat is completely full it's unlikely they'll put someone in a foreigner's room even if you just pay for one. The full journey takes anywhere from 26-30 hours and costs Tk 1010/610 in first/second class. It's best avoided during the rainy seasons and during holidays when the launches get over crowded with home-returning city dwellers. The more eco-friendly may prefer to take their trash off with them: otherwise, it's likely to end up in the river at the end of the journey.\n</p><p>BIWTC also operates many other more basic ferries that may be useful for smaller distances.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Talk\">Talk</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: Talk\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The national language is <a href=\"/en/Bengali_phrasebook\" title=\"Bengali phrasebook\">Bengali</a> (<i>Bangla</i>) and is spoken everywhere. It's an Indo-Aryan language derived from Prakit, Pali and Sanskrit and written in its own script. Many Bangladeshis understand only limited English such as basic affirmatives, negatives, and some numbers. This is especially so in rural areas and among the lower socio-economic classes. Learning a few Bengali words ahead of your trip will prove very useful.\n</p><p>Two centuries of British colonisation lead people to identify most white foreigners as either British or Americans, and to view them with curiosity. The first question you will probably be asked is \"What is your country?\" (\"Desh kothay?\" in Bangla). If hawkers or rickshaw-wallahs are over-zealous in selling you their products or services, simply say \"Amar dorkar nai\" (\"I don't need [this item]\") or \"Lagbey nah\" (\"No need\") as a colloquial way of saying \"No, thanks.\"\n</p><p>If you don't wish to give money to beggars and other unfortunates, simply tell them \"Maaf koro\" (with informal you) or \"Maaf koren\" (with polite/formal you), which means \"Pardon me\"; or you can apply a tricky concept by saying \"Amar bangthi poisha nai\", meaning \"I have no change.\" Above all, if you're refusing a service or product, don't linger. Walk on as you say these phrases. Otherwise, your lingering may be misinterpreted by peddlers as your uncertainty about refusal.\n</p><p>If you plan to travel beyond the cities it is best to engage a travel guide or an interpreter or buy a tour package that offers you both.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See\">See</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: See\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#See\" title=\"click to add a see listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '27', 'see', 'Bangladesh');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Bangladesh  as a vacation land has many facets.

Traditionally most of the country lives off of the once-bountiful fresh-water river fish, especially the officially designated \"national fish\" <b>Hilsa</b> (kind of Shad fish). The <b>Hilsa</b> has a nice flavour but some may find the many fine bones difficult to manage; if you can master eating this fish, consider yourself on par with the locals in fish-eating and deboning expertise.  Various recipes exist for cooking Hilsa, suitable for all seasons and all regions of the country. Mutton is also popular, as in most Muslim countries, as is decidedly lean or hard chicken. Rice is almost always the staple side dish.\n</p><p>Mixed vegetable curries are plentiful - potato, eggplant, squash and tomatoes are the staple ingredients. Gourds, tubers and certain root vegetables are common. In the major cities (Dhaka, Chittagong, etc.), you will find a larger variety of vegetables than in rural areas.\n</p><p>The idea of salad varies from the international standard. In Bangladesh, salad has not been extensively developed, and \"kacha\" (raw) vegetables are generally not deemed very appetizing or palatable (with the exception of cucumbers), especially in more rural or suburban areas and in less Westernized households. Traditionally, most salad vegetables (carrots, celery, lettuce, paprika, etc.) were not even grown in most agrarian households, so the use of these vegetables was extremely rare. Hence, borrowing from the Mughal traditions, a few round slices of onions and cucumbers, spiced with salt, chilies, etc., is often treated as a full plate of salad. \n</p><p><i>Dal</i> is usually a given side dish or meal course for all households, even the poorest or most rural (who often cannot afford any other daily meal courses). Most Bangladeshi dal varies from its West Bengali counterpart, and even more so from its other Indian counterparts, primarily because it is more watery and less concentrated or spiced. An easy analogy would be that whereas most Indian dal is more like thick stew, most Bangladeshi dal is more like light soup or broth. The Hindus of Bangladesh have greater varieties of Dal recipes, just as they have greater varieties of vegetarian dishes. The Muslims have thicker and more spiced varieties of dal. Dal recipes vary regionally in Bangladesh, so be careful not to over-generalize after a brief experience.\n</p><p>Boiled eggs (<i>dhim</i>) are a popular snack (Tk 3-5), and fresh fruit is abundant, such as bananas (Tk 2/ea), apples (Chinese, Tk 80-100/kg), oranges, grapes, pomegranates and papayas.  Delicious and diverse, mangos (Tk 50-150/kg) are a very popular fruit throughout Bangladesh.\n</p><p><b>Fast food</b> restaurants and bakeries serving burgers, kababs, spring rolls, vegetable patties and just about anything else you can throw in a deep fryer are dotted around most cities. Most items will run around Tk 10/each.Bangladesh also has international fast food chains like Pizza Hut, KFC, A&amp;W, Burger King, Nando's, Tekiya.\n</p><p>To enjoy the tastes of Dhaka one needs to go to old Dhaka. The Haji biriyani, Nanna biriyani are a must. Also Al Razzak restaurant is famous for its Shahi food. To savour local food one must go to Korai Gost at Dhanmondi Satmosjid road, Kasturi restaurant at Gulshan &amp; Purana Paltan area. No one should leave Bangladesh without tasting the Phuchka and Chatpati available in the streets of Dhaka,Chittagong. Also there are loads of Chinese and Thai restaurants in Bangladesh which serve localized chinese and thai dishes.Bailey road in Dhaka is the unofficial food street of the nation followed by Satmoshjid Road.Dhaka also has Japanese, Korean and Indian restaurants located mostly in Gulshan area. For world class Ice creams do visit Moven pick, Club gelato in Gulshan. To taste Kebab, Babecue tonight in Dhanmondi is the best followed by Koyla in Gulshan.\n</p><p>Most Bangladeshis eat with their right hand as in neighboring countries. Never use your left hand to bring food to your mouth, though it's ok to use it for bringing a glass to your mouth or to serve food from a common dish with a spoon. Every restaurant will have a handwashing station (sometimes just a pitcher of water and a bowl if they don't have running water), and you should use this before and after the meal. To eat with your hand, rake in a little portion of the rice and a bit of the curry to an open space on your plate (usually create a bit of space on the side of the plate closest to you, sufficiently inward from the rim but NOT in the centre of the plate), and mix the rice and curry with your fingers. Then, create a little ball or mound (it should be compact and modestly sized, but does not need to be perfectly shaped or anything--function over form!) of the mixture and pick it up with all your fingers, and scoop in into your mouth. Your fingers should not enter your mouth in the process, and your upper fingers and palms should not get dirty either. Only toddlers and foreigners/tourists are exempted from these rules. It doesn't matter a whole lot if you don't get it all exactly right, but know that the entire restaurant is watching and waiting to see if you do. Attempting to eat with your hands and failing miserably will raise many a smile.  The use of cutlery (except serving spoons for common dishes) is lacking in rural areas and poorer households, and only basic cutlery of spoons, or sometimes a fork is sometimes available in urban restaurants and more Westernised, urban households. However, the use of hands is a more humble and culturally respectful gesture, especially from a tourist.\n</p><p>Table-sharing is acceptable and even expected in most establishments, with the exception of nicer urban restaurants. Many places have separate curtained-off booths for women and families, a nice reprieve from prying eyes.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drink\">Drink</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30\" title=\"Edit section: Drink\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Drink\" title=\"click to add a drink listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '30', 'drink', 'Bangladesh');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Nightlife</b> in Bangladesh is nearly non-existent.

Some of the nicest hotels in the cities have fully equipped bars with exaggerated prices to match. However, lack of commercial availability of liquor should not always be confused with a cultural aversion to alcohol in mainstream society. You'll likely find that Bengali Christians and many urbanized, upper-class Muslims privately have a more liberal, Westernized attitude toward social consumption of alcohol. However, most 5 Star Hotels like Radisson, Ruposhi Bangla (Former Sheraton), Shonargoan, Regency and few clubs in Gulshan are arranging DJ / Dance parties on a frequent basis. Foreigners may bump into one of those parties if they are lucky. Usual entrance fees of such parties are around BDT 2000/- (USD 30). Young people of upper class and higher upper class of the society are the main portions of the formed crowd. However, in some places, western clothed hired companions are available. Foreigners looking for a clean vacation should stay away from them using common sense. dLequires does not flow freely in these parties most of the time.\n</p><p>Purchasing alcohol is very hard (and expensive), so if you \u201cneed\u201d a drink, or imagine you will do so, it is recommended to buy a bottle of duty-free to take with you.

Made from nectar, fruits or rice, these drinks are quite strong (Choani has two more varieties: Dochoani and Techoani, meaning they were distilled twice or thrice) and go well with the pork the natives cook.\n</p><p><b>Coffee</b> is -- like the rest of the world, a perennial middle-class 'Adda' (gossip) accompaniment in this city.

They include, but are not limited to, the Lalbagh Quilla, Ahsan Manjil, Shaheed Minar, Boro Katra, Choto Katra, the National Museum, Jatiyo Songshad Bhaban (the Parliament Building) etc. The Suhrawardy Uddan and the Ramna Park are two parks that provide green respite to city dwellers. Other tourist attractions include places like Baitul Mukarram (National Mosque), the High Court Building, the Bangabandhu Museum, etc. If you're visiting only one thing, then the LalBagh Qilla fort is a must-see, in the older part of town. The older part of Dhaka, known as \"Puran Dhaka\", is literally a city of history, with hundred-year-old buildings crammed on each side of hundreds of narrow lanes. Each \"Moholla\" (city block) of Puran Dhaka is unique with its specialized shops and artisans and gives an authentic taste of what Dhaka is all about.\n</p><p>The rest of Bangladesh is also ornamented with thousands of gems, most of which remain hidden and await exploration. The names are endless, but the prominent ones include, Moynamoti, Paharpur (Shompur Bihar), Mohasthangor, Kantajir Mondir, Ramshagor, Shatgombuj Mosque, Khanjahan Ali's Shrine, Shriti Shoudho etc. These sites offer architectures from various eras of the country's history, including Buddhist, Hindu and Muslim eras and date back thousand years.\n</p><p>The natural beauty of Bangladesh can be explored away from the hustle and bustle of Dhaka, the Capital. ( Bangladesh has world longest unbroken Surfing beach in Cox's Bazaar ). Also, it has the largest mangrove forest in the world, the \"Sundarbans\" (\"beautiful forests\", named after the \"Sundari\" [beautiful] trees in it). The hill tracts of Rangamati, Khagrachori and \"Bandarban\" (\"monkey forest\") offer exciting trekking opportunities, while the Kaptai Lake (situated amongst the hills of Rangamati) can be considered a romantic getaway. The villages are the true countryside of Bangladesh and almost always have green paddy fields and yellow mustard fields with flowing rivers. Other natural wonders of Bangladesh include the Padma (Ganges) river, the Madhabkunda, Jaflong, the tea gardens of Sylhet/Sreemangal and Moulovibazar, etc. Recently Bangladesh Government has formed Tourist Police unit to better protect local and foreign tourists as well as look after the nature and wildlife in the tourist spots.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Work\">Work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34\" title=\"Edit section: Work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><b>Ministry of Expatriates' Welfare and Overseas Employment</b>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://probashi.gov.bd\">[40]</a>.\n<b>Board of Investment</b>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.boi.gov.bd\">[41]</a>.\n<b>Work permit in Bangladesh</b>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://resource.ogrlegal.com/work-permit-bangladesh\">[42]</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_safe\">Stay safe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=35\" title=\"Edit section: Stay safe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Bangladesh is a country full of friendly and open minded people. But being a poor country with a high poverty rate, there are some impoverished or bad-natured people who may find ways to exploit a foreigner/tourist. Please stick to common sense precautions, such as not walking around unnecessarily or alone after dark. Also, if you do find yourself in trouble, create some noise and draw the attention of others who are almost certain to come to your aid. Foreigners, particularly Caucasian, will for the most part will be safe when walking around city streets as you will undoubtedly be watched by multiple curious locals at any one time.  When travelling by rickshaw, CNG (auto-rickshaw) or bus, be careful to keep valuables close at hand. Don't wear expensive jewellery without precaution; most middle-class locals now simply wear imitation gold/silver and rhinestones/clay and beaded pendants.\n</p><p>Phone snatching is very common here. Don't exhibit your costly mobiles on the roads. Be careful in auto's also. Even the auto's are covered with iron grills, still many chances for cutting the side covers and pulling the valuables is common practice by the chain snatchers. \n</p><p>The clothing of local women varies, according to religion and degree of religious conservatism, socio-political climate (varies from time to time), geographic region, and socio-economic status. In general, as a female tourist, it is wisest to wear at least the salwar kameez, which is both easy to wear and relatively versatile and functional, while being generally culturally respectful. However, most of Bangladesh is a relatively open-minded Muslim country, and the youth in major cities (e.g.: Dhaka, Chittagong, etc.) are quite Westernized.\n</p><p>Nationwide strikes or \u201chartals\u201d are widely employed as a means of political expression in Bangladesh. The political opposition over the past several years has called a number of these hartals, resulting in the virtual shutdown of transportation and commerce, and sometimes attacks on individuals who do not observe the hartals. Clashes between rival political groups during hartals have resulted in deaths and injuries. Visitors should avoid all political protests, demonstrations, and marches.  During hartals, visitors should exercise caution in all areas and remain indoors whenever possible. Hartals, demonstrations, and other protests can occur at ANY time.\n</p><p>It's best to not eat, drink or smoke anything offered to you by strangers - there's a growing problem in many Asian countries of drugging, and you're likely to see signs warning you against it on buses, trains, etc. That's not to say you shouldn't take someone up on their offer for a home cooked meal, but you may want to think twice about that piece of candy the person in the seat next to you just handed to you. Also, be careful about the sanitation procedures of local street food and snacks.\n</p><p>Speeding bus/coaches/trucks cause many deaths. Road signs and traffic lights are often ignored by cars, and traffic jams are always a given, making it very difficult for pedestrians to travel. It is wisest NOT to drive yourself or to walk major roads alone. Consequently, road travel (if absolutely necessary) is best undertaken with an experienced local driver in a good vehicle with safety belts. Use rickshaws with precaution; although a very authentic local drive, it is also the most dangerous vehicle for transport, especially on major routes (now being banned).\n</p><p>Be aware of the weather, especially during the spring and fall.  Bangladesh has a similar climate to the Southeastern United States.  This, unfortunately, includes severe thunderstorms and violent tornadoes that can appear suddenly and without warning.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bangladesh&amp;action=edit&amp;section=36\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li> <b>Bottled water</b> is recommended, as the tap water is often unsafe for foreign stomachs, and some hand-drawn tube wells are contaminated with naturally occurring arsenic.

Most however, are content to just look... and look... and look.

The people are in general very hospitable, and a few precautions will keep it this way:\n</p>\n<ul><li> As in most neighbouring countries, the left hand is considered unclean and is used for toilet duties, removing shoes, etc. Hence, always use your right hand to offer or receive anything, and to bring food to your mouth.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Men, especially strangers and foreigners, should never attempt to shake hands with or touch local women &#8212; simply put your hand on your heart and bow slightly to greet.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Women travelling without men may find it slightly harder to get an auto-rickshaw driver who will take them to their destination. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Mosques are sometimes off-limits to non-Muslims and certain areas of them off-limits to women. Inquire with someone at the mosque before entering and before taking any pictures. Cover your head and arms and legs, and take off your shoes before entering.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Standing from your seat and bowing slightly to greet elderly individuals will gain you respect and social approval. Do not refer to your elders or those in socially senior positions to you (i.e.: doctors, professors/teachers, religious leaders, etc.) by their first names; this is considered extremely rude and utmostly derogatory. Children do not call their parents by their first or last names, and in some regions of the country, wives do not call their husbands by their first names either.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Keep in mind that Bangladesh sees only a tiny number of foreign visitors, and most locals will be genuinely curious about you, watching your every move and expression. Don't underestimate how impressionable some can be, make sure you're leaving good ones!</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Also keep in mind, that whenever you enter someone's home, open your shoes before you enter.

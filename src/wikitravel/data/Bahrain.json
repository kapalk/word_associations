It's an oasis of social liberalism &#8211; or at least Western-friendly moderation &#8211; among the Muslim countries of the region.

The country has few oil reserves, but it has established itself as a hub for refining as well as international banking, while also achieving a socially liberal (by Gulf standards at least) monarchy. Its economy depends to a small extent on Saudis interested in a little entertainment, not available in the strictly Islamic Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Electricity\">Electricity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Electricity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Officially 220V 50Hz.

Man-made beaches at luxury hotels are nice, but only accessible for a price. Winters in Bahrain are dry and average daytime temperatures in the low 70sF, night time lows in the 50sF. Spring and fall are pleasant, with dry weather and nights cooling off into the 60sF after days of around 85F. Late winter and spring are known for dust storms which, while not as severe as those found elsewhere in the Gulf, are still rather unpleasant. Summertime is very hot and muggy in Bahrain, with daytime temperatures being from 100-120F, and nights cooling down to anywhere from 75-90F. The shallow waters around Bahrain are typically anywhere from 75F in winter to 85F in spring and fall, and usually around 90F+ in summer. Due to the shallowness of the water, it is possible to get heat stroke while swimming.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:352px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Bahrain_map.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/52/Bahrain_map.png/350px-Bahrain_map.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"384\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/52/Bahrain_map.png/525px-Bahrain_map.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/52/Bahrain_map.png/700px-Bahrain_map.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"2063\" data-file-height=\"2261\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Bahrain_map.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Map of Bahrain</div></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cities\">Cities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Cities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li> <a href=\"/en/Manama\" title=\"Manama\">Manama</a> -

Tickets cost SR60 (SR50 when you buy two-way) and can be purchased in advance, although they'll squeeze you in without a reservation if there is space. As crossing the Causeway involves two passport checks and one customs checks, figure on 2 hours for the trip, plus any traffic delays at busy times like Thursday evenings.  At congested times, buses may actually be slightly faster than private cars, as they can use separate lanes at immigration and customs.\n</p><p>Note that, as of 2011, Bahrain Saudi Transport &amp; Tourism (BASATCO) offers what seems to be similar buses for a slightly lower fare of BD4, although four times a day only.\n</p><p>As of May 2014, the schedule for SABTCO is as follows:\n</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\">\n<tr>\n<th> From Dammam </th>\n<th> From Khobar </th>\n<th> </th>\n<th> From Manama\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 07:15 </td>\n<td> 08:00 </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> 07:00\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 10:15 </td>\n<td> 11:00 </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> 10:00\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 13:15 </td>\n<td> 14:00 </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> 14:00\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 17:15 </td>\n<td> 18:00 </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> 17:00\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 20:15 </td>\n<td> 21:00 </td>\n<td> </td>\n<td> 19:00\n</td></tr></table>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=10\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The 26-km King Fahd Causeway connects Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. The border post is on an island in the middle of the causeway. The causeway has a toll for entering on each side: 2.5 BD from Bahrain and 25 SAR from Saudi. There are no tolls leaving the causeway. If you have Saudi residency (Iqama), there is no charge for the Bahrain immigration visa stamp, but if you are a visitor to Saudi (e.g. business visa), then it will cost you 15BD/150SAR, the same as at Bahrain airport. \n</p><p>SABTCO's Bahrain Limo taxis, which seat up to four, can take you across for prices starting from BD30/SR300. Tolls are usually included in taxi and limo fares.\n</p><p>Rental vehicles cannot usually be taken through the border. To cross in a Saudi rental car, you need extra paperwork and insurance from the rental company, Saudi residency (Iqama) and a Saudi driving license (not just a home country license). If the car is booked to a company account, you also need a letter from your company (or standing arrangement with the rental company if it is a regular request).\n</p><p>Unofficial taxis (private cars) can be found hanging around bus stations at both ends, Dammam train station, and on the Saudi side of the causeway border post. The going rate from the Saudi side of the border to Manama is 25 BHD/250 SAR, but you may be able to negotiate this down when there are no queues at the border (i.e. a quick turnaround for the driver). Take the mobile number of the driver to arrange pick-up and shuttle back through the border for your return. \n</p><p>If you don't have the right paperwork for your Saudi car, or rental car, you can drive to the border, park it up for the duration of your visit to Bahrain, then take an unofficial taxi across the border. Parking on the island is free, but there are very few legal spaces, and they are always occupied, so you will probably have to find a safe illegal space and hope you won't get fined or towed. Note that the small car park on the north side of the main road, near the exit from Bahrain, is actually the border guard employee car park, so be very careful if you park there. One hint is to find an unofficial taxi driver before you park (they will often walk up to your car if you are cruising for a space). Then follow the driver, wait for him to move his car, then park in his space. When he brings you back after your trip to Bahrain, he can park back in the same space. Yes, parking spaces are that valuable.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"On_foot\">On foot</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: On foot\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>You cannot walk across the border on the King Fahd Causeway, you have to be in a vehicle. So you cannot take a Saudi taxi to the border, walk through, then take a Bahraini taxi from the other side. \n</p><p>Obviously this is a ridiculous situation, as it means (unofficial) taxi drivers have to queue to cross the border in both directions, just to pick up a one-way fare. It would be much more efficient for everyone if they had pick-up and drop-off places on both sides, and let people walk through the immigration and customs facilities already provided for bus passengers, who have to leave the bus and enter the buildings to be processed.\n</p><p>You can take unofficial taxis through the border (see above). For example, from the Saudi side, get any regular taxi to take you to the causeway (you will pay an extra 20 SAR for the toll). Then find an unofficial taxi to take you through the border and on to Bahrain.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_boat\">By boat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=12\" title=\"Edit section: By boat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Valfajre-8 ferry to and from Iran has been cancelled.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Get_around\">Get around</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: Get around\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_taxi\">By taxi</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=14\" title=\"Edit section: By taxi\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Taxi_Bahrain.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/dd/Taxi_Bahrain.JPG/300px-Taxi_Bahrain.JPG\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/dd/Taxi_Bahrain.JPG/450px-Taxi_Bahrain.JPG 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/dd/Taxi_Bahrain.JPG/600px-Taxi_Bahrain.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"3008\" data-file-height=\"2000\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Taxi_Bahrain.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Bahraini taxi</div></div></div>\n<p>Bahrain is NOT a good place to be taking taxis due to their very high rates and their general lack of availability. Recommended is to rent a car.  Even when taxis use the meter, a 10 minute ride can cost around 20-25 USD.  With the sparse availability of taxis, you may need to pay your taxi to wait for you at your destination and then drive you home.  This means a $40 dinner may cost you over $100 including the needed taxi service.\n</p><p>The official rates start at ($2.65) BD 1.000 plus 0.200 Fils per kilometer.  In practice, though, meters will be \"broken\", covered, missing or just ignored. Check the meter is working before you start driving. If it is not working, it is recommended to stop, get out and find another taxi. Otherwise you must haggle and agree on a fare. \n</p><p>However, a new agreement have been reached between the government and taxis representatives on August 2008; and a growing majority of taxis now use their meters. Rates vary from 3 to 5 dinars for a ride within Manama / Juffair.\n</p><p>Taxis in Bahrain are not like the U.A.E. where they are regulated and will never rip you off. Sadly you name the scam and you will find 'most' of the taxi drivers you hail from a rank or on the street will try it. The meter will be hidden under a prayer hat, a box of tissues, a towel or cloth. The meters are in all official taxis and mounted on top of the dashboard. \nThere are other taxis which are generally white pickup trucks with 'taxi' stickers on the side but these do not have meters and you will have to negotiate a fare. \n</p><p>There is a surcharge of BD 1.000 if you get a taxi outside a hotel. If you catch a cab from another location, or flag down a taxi while walking, make sure the extra BD 1 fee is not already on the meter (right hand display is the fixed surcharge). For example, if you pick up a taxi at a hotel around the souk area, you will pay BD 1.000 surcharge, but if you go to the taxi rank at the Bab Al Bahrain, you will not. A short walk can save you money.\nYou really need to watch the meter like a hawk, check it starts at zero and no extras are added and watch out for the driver pressing buttons on it whilst distracting you during the ride. \nDo not accept a BD 1.000 charge for 'waiting at a rank' that is not a hotel one or another BD 1.000 charge for dropping you at a hotel!. \nYou will find stickers in the front on the window advising you of any extras, there is also a further charge if you exceed a certain distance. \n</p><p>The airport gives guidelines as to the official way of calculating taxi fares. Notice that an extra BD 2.000 will be added if you take a taxi waiting at the airport <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://bahrainairport.com/bia/taxi.htm\">[3]</a>.\n</p><p>On the whole some taxis offer a good service but you do encounter a lot of bandits.\nBe aware when traveling from the airport to always use the white with red roof or London style taxis. Also there is a rule if the meter is not used there is no charge; hold your ground on this and call the police, and the driver will cooperate very quickly with the correct fare for the trip. A common tactic used by the taxi drivers is to claim they don't have any change or try to give you change in Saudi Riyals. They will insist the Riyals are worth the same as the Bahraini Dinar or the American Dollar when in fact they are closer to .25 American.    \n</p><p>Finding a taxi can be difficult, although major hotels and malls usually have a few waiting outside so be careful if you leave Manama center. Some privately owned companies operate in the kingdom and you can download their apps for your smart phones. These are easy to use and you select a pickup and drop off point then you will be notified who your driver is, their car type, registration and then you track them online. When you have been dropped off you will receive a email receipt of your fare including details.

The hours are 8AM-8PM Tues-Sun; admission is 2 dinar.\n</p><p>Bahrain has three other small forts. <b>Abu Mahir Fort</b> is located in Muharraq and is also known as Muharraq Fort. It was built on the foundations of  much old fort and was positioned to protect the western approaches. \n</p><p>Also on Muharraq is <b>Arad Fort</b>. Dating from the 16th century, this fort was built by the Arabs - before being captured by the Portuguese in 1559. It was then recaptured by the Omanis in 1635. It has been restored and now hosts cultural events.

Bahrain has a number of musueums - <b>Al Oraifi Museum</b> in Muharraq (Dilmun era artifacts), <b>Beit al Quran</b> in Hoora (rare collection of Islamic manuscripts), <b>Bahrain National Museum</b> on the Al Fateh Corniche, Manama, <b>Currency Museum</b> in the Diplomatic Area (Bahraini coinage) and the <b>Oil Museum</b> in Sakhir (history of the local oil industry). For example, this museum exhibits how to get oil in Bahrain and so on.\n</p><p>Beaches. The year-round warm climate means that the water is very warm, even in wintertime, when cooler temperatures may occur. The water is known for being very calm and clear. \n</p><p><b>Tree of Life</b>. Although trees grow in Bahrain, this one is special because of its location in the middle of the desert amidst the oil wells and other infrastructure of the petroleum industry.  You need a car to reach the tree, as it is far from the main roads and not on any public transportation route.\n</p><p>To reach the tree, take the Zallaq Highway heading east, which becomes the Al-Muaskar Highway.  You will eventually see a sign for the Tree of Life indicating a right turn.  (Although the sign seems to point you to turn onto a dirt road which actually goes nowhere, do not do so, instead wait until the next intersection which is several metres ahead).  There are no signs as you travel down this road, but pay attention to a scrap metal yard on your right.  Before you reach a hill which warns you of a steep 10% incline, take a right.  As you continue straight down this road (including roundabouts), you will begin to see Tree of Life signs again.  The signs will lead you down a road which will then be devoid of these signs, but you will eventually see the tree in the distance on the right (it is large and wide, not to be mistaken for other smaller trees along the way).  You turn onto a dirt path at Gas Well #371.  You can drive up to just outside of the tree, but make sure you stay on the vehicle-worn path, as turning off of it is likely to get your car stuck in the softer sand.\n</p><p>Although it seems like a chore to reach, the Tree of Life is worth the visit for the oddity of it.  The tree is covered in graffiti, although this is not visible until you get up close.  Try to make your arrival near sunset for a picturesque view of the tree and the surrounding desert.\n</p><p>[Update 2011] There is also a (new&#160;?) much higher quality road. As of early 2014, construction is underway for a concrete wall and path around the tree.  There is some basic background information within the completed sections of the wall.\n</p><p>Bahrain also has a set of remarkable <b>prehistoric burial grounds</b>. These extensive sites, often densely covered by burial mounds, can be found at <b>A'ali</b> (the biggest prehistoric cemetery in the world), <b>Al Hajar</b>, <b>Buri</b>, <b>Hamad Town</b>, <b>Jannusan</b>, <b>Sa'ar</b>, <b>Shakhoora</b> and <b>Tylos</b>.\n</p><p>There are a number of <b>famous houses</b> which can also be visited. <b>Al Jasra House</b> is located in Al Jasra village and was built by the late Amir, Shaikh Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa in 1933.

One dinar is worth nearly three US dollars (US$2.65, to be precise, as the exchange rate is not fixed), making this one of the world's strongest currencies, and this can get some getting used to: that seemingly cheap ten-dinar taxi ride is in fact almost $27 and thus an extortionate rip-off!\n</p><p>The dinar is a fully convertible currency, and there are currently no restrictions on its import or export. Denominations for coins are 5 fils, 10 fils, 25 fils, 50 fils and 100 fils. Denominations for banknotes are 500 fils (BD 1/2), BD 1, BD 5, BD 10 and BD 20. \n</p><p>The dinar is pegged to the Saudi riyal at 1:10, and riyals are accepted almost everywhere at that rate, although odds are you'll get your change in dinars and hotels may try to screw you out of a few percent.  If coming in from Saudi, there's no reason to change your money, but do try to get rid of any excess dinars before you leave the country, as they're hard to exchange elsewhere, even in Saudi.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Costs\">Costs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: Costs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Like most Gulf countries, Bahrain is not cheap. A decent dinner can cost between BD 5 to BD 40, and car rental at BD 7-20/day is reasonable, hotel prices vary and depends on your budget: a perfectly ordinary room in a \"good\" hotel ranges between BD 22 and BD 260 based on 4 and 5 star hotels.

The main dining area is Adliya.  In Adliya, you can take your pick among numerous cafes, with Coco's (very well priced and delicious food) and Lilou's among the most famous. Mirai is an incredible Japanese Fusion restaurant perfect for a special occasion. If the weather is cold from December-February other events are held in Adliya like food festival and Block 338.\n</p><p>Restaurants in Bahrain run the gamut for cheap stalls offering local food to fancy restaurants in fancy hotels. The most famous local fast food is Jasmi's (Must try). American fast food franchises such as Burger King and McDonald's are available, as well as Texas Chicken.  Western (mostly American) style-foods and franchises can be found around the malls and in the city centre, offering food for upper mid-range prices. Common fast food like KFC, McDonald's, Papa johns, Dairy queen, etc. can be found in the streets in every city and town. Beside to other local shawarma, Flafel, Burgers  that have its special taste.\nSome restaurants are located in not in Manama but in other places. \nCaf\u00e9 Italia is an Italian food restaurant in Adliya. Prices of dishes are reasonable, so there are many repeat customers. Lanna Thai is a Thai food restaurant in Budaiya. Fried rice is especially delicious.

A minority of expats work in  the financial sector however the majority are engaged as laborers, policemen, drivers and lower class lowly paid artisans.   Conditions for many of these people are poor and there are regular allegations of human rights abuses and 'Modern Day Slavery'.\n</p><p>There are two types of expats in Bahrain- those who work extremely low paying jobs dependent on their employer who holds their visa and the middle/upper middle class expats who are employed in finance, foreign military, oil/gas industries. Low paying jobs are often held by Indian, Pakistani and Filipino workers who are essentially trafficked into the country. In former times it was the tradition that employers provided benefits to expat employees including;\n</p>\n<ol><li> House or housing allowance</li>\n<li> Medical insurance</li>\n<li> Free flights home every year</li>\n<li> An additional salary of a minimum of 15 days for every year worked (there are slabs according to the number of years worked)</li></ol>\n<p>However, this is widely no longer true with 'Lump sum' self sufficiency 'local hire'contracts now becoming the norm.\n</p><p>At present, there is a 1% charge on salary (gosi tax) which goes to subsidize the unemployed, but a lot of employers are giving their employees an additional bonus by paying it themselves instead of deducting it from the salary. \n</p><p>Some executive positions used to have their children's education sponsored however this is now dwindling. \n</p><p>Working hours differ across different industries. Government offices work from 7:30 to 2:30 and the private sector now tends to be 7-30 to 1800 or much longer for Asian expatriates. Friday and Saturday is the official weekend for all public sector establishments as well as government schools and universities.\n</p><p>One of the major difficulties for expatriates in Bahrain is debt. The economy is in many ways structured to encourage expats to live right on the edge of their earnings and it is virtually impossible for most people to save money. There are legal processes which result in a global travel ban being placed on expatriates in a matter of minutes if they are unfortunate enough to get into debt.   An effect of the travel ban is that the work permit is automatically suspended thus meaning that the expatriate can not work to pay off the debt, nor can he/she leave the country.  Many expats have been stuck in Bahrain for years caught in this dilemma and a significant number have died in the country unable to travel for treatment or afford medical bills <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/01/16/bahrain-resolve-travel-ban-conundrum\">[11]</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_safe\">Stay safe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: Stay safe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The ordinary social crime rate in Bahrain is low and violent crime is rare.

April through August can be very hot (up to 50 \u00baC) and humid. Use an umbrella to protect you from the harsh sun. It is important to stay hydrated, especially if you are outdoors during the day.   Bottled water is sold practically everywhere in the city from \"Cold Stores\" and small restaurants at very reasonable prices.  In the souk, walking vendors offer small chilled bottles but you may end up paying more than the bottle is really worth.  If you are living in Bahrain for an extended period of time, you can set up an arrangement for a neighborhood Cold Store to deliver bottled water to your flat, or sign up for water delivery through several companies on the island. Water on the island is barely potable, but not recommended for drinking due to amount of bacteria and heavy mineral content.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Respect\">Respect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bahrain&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29\" title=\"Edit section: Respect\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Bahrain is a fairly gracious host nation but it is imperative to demonstrate respect and courtesy in reference to their particular cultural practices and religion at all times.

However, in beach clubs and hotels, swimsuits, bikinis and shorts are okay to wear. Do not show signs of affection to members of the opposite sex in public. People of the opposite sex have been arrested for kissing in public and it is just not socially accepted.

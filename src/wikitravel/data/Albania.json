As in other western states, the idea of religious tolerance is so normal as to be completely uninteresting, differences of ideology will more often be political.\n</p><p>Traditional Albanian culture honors the role and person of the guest. In return for this place of honor, respect is expected from the guest. Albanians enjoy long walks in the city streets, drinking coffee and, among the younger generations, participating in nightlife activities such as cafe lounging and dancing.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Recent_History\">Recent History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Recent History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Following the defeat of the Axis powers at the end of World War II, a Communist government was established, presided over by resistance leader Enver Hoxha. Albania became famous for its isolation, not just from the free market democracies of Western Europe and the United States, but also from the Soviet Union, China, and even neighboring Yugoslavia.\n</p><p>The Communist party relinquished power several years after Hoxha's death, and Albania established a multi-party democracy with a coalition government. The transition to democracy has proven difficult as governments have tried to deal with high unemployment, a dilapidated infrastructure, widespread gangsterism and disruptive political opponents. Today Albania is moving closer towards neo-liberalism, with EU integration as its goal; Albania signed the SAA in June 2006, thus completing the first major step towards joining the EU. In 2008, Albania received an invitation to join NATO.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Climate\">Climate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Climate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>With its coastline facing the Adriatic and Ionian seas, its highlands backed upon the elevated Balkan landmass, and the entire country lying at a latitude subject to a variety of weather patterns during the winter and summer seasons, Albania has a high number of climatic regions for so small an area. The coastal lowlands have typically Mediterranean weather, whereas the highlands have a Mediterranean continental climate. In both the lowlands and the interior, the weather varies markedly from north to south.\n</p><p>The lowlands have mild winters averaging about 7\u00b0C (45\u00b0F); summer temperatures average 24\u00b0C (75\u00b0F). In the southern lowlands, temperatures average about 5\u00b0C (9\u00b0F) higher throughout the year; the difference is greater than 5\u00b0C (9\u00b0F) during the summer and somewhat less during the winter.\n</p><p>Inland temperatures are affected more by differences in elevation than by latitude or any other factor. Low winter temperatures in the mountains are caused by the continental air mass that dominates the weather in Eastern Europe and the Balkans. Northerly and northeasterly winds blow much of the time. Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool.\n</p><p>Average precipitation is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the Mediterranean Sea and the continental air mass. Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Albania_Regions_map.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/7/7c/Albania_Regions_map.png/600px-Albania_Regions_map.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"869\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/7/7c/Albania_Regions_map.png/900px-Albania_Regions_map.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/7/7c/Albania_Regions_map.png/1200px-Albania_Regions_map.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"2000\" data-file-height=\"2895\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Albania_Regions_map.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Map of Albania with regions colour-coded</div></div></div>\n<div id=\"region_list\">\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#ae86ae\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Coastal_Albania\" title=\"Coastal Albania\">Coastal Albania</a></b> <br />the long narrow strip of between about 10 and 30km wide along the whole of the Albanian coast, bordering both the Adriatic Sea and Ionian Sea\n</td></tr></table>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#6ba1c5\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Northeastern_Albania\" title=\"Northeastern Albania\">Northeastern Albania</a></b> <br />the inland region to the north of the Shkumbin River, bordering Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia.\n</td></tr></table>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#71b37b\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Southeastern_Albania\" title=\"Southeastern Albania\">Southeastern Albania</a></b> <br />the inland region to the south of the Shkumbin River bordering Macedonia and Greece, and including the great border lakes, Lake Ohrid and Lake Prespa.\n</td></tr></table>\n</div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cities\">Cities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Cities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/en/Tirana\" title=\"Tirana\">Tirana</a> (Tiran\u00eb) \u2014 the capital.

It costs ALL350 each way and leaves on the hour from both the airport and from Skanderberg Square. It runs from about 08:00-19:00. The trip takes around 25-30 minutes. From the airport exit doors, walk towards the parking lot past the taxi touts to find the bus stop. At Skanderberg Square, the bus stop is located around the northwest corner, near other bus stops. The bus is not only punctual but sometimes even early, so plan to be there a few minutes in advance. Do not be intimidated by the signs not mentioning \"airport\" or any variation of it at the Skanderberg Square stop. \"Rinas\" means the bus goes to the airport.

There are a lot of slow moving vehicles along the curvy, mountainous route, so extra caution must be exercised, especially around corners and during over-taking. A new motorway is being constructed between Elbasan and Tirana.  Sections of the motorway and a long tunnel are now complete (May 2017) allowing high-speed travel in some areas.  However, other sections are still under construction.  As of May 2017, it appears that most motorway construction will be completed within a year.  The winding highway down the mountain pass from Macedonia to Elbasan has yet to see significant change.\n</p><p><b>The road between Prizren (Kosovo) and Tirana (Albania)</b> (E851/A1) is comparable in quality to that found on roads in other parts of Europe. Much of the road is dual carriage (autobahn/motorway style), but some is single carriageway. Extra caution should be exercised along some bridges near the Kosovo border, as they have not been widened to dual carriageways. Also be aware of the fact that cows run free on the motorway: there is no fence, and before dusk they return home using the motorway itself. As of March 2018 the road is tolled and a fee must be paid to use the motorway.\n</p><p><b>The road between Shkoder (border of Montenegro) and Tirana (E762/SH1)</b> is of sufficient quality for driving, but there are a lot of slow-moving vehicles and uncontrolled access points, so extra caution must be exercised, especially during over-taking. A portion of the road between Milot and Thumane has been widened to motorway standard as of 2012. \n</p><p><b>The road between Han i Hotit (north of Shkoder) and Vermosh (beside the border crossing with Montenegro in the mountains) (SH20)</b> is half unpaved as of summer 2015. The first 30km from Han i Hotit is a high quality new asphalt road; however the road abruptly turns into a stone track for the remaining 30km until Vermosh. The unpaved section is suitable for 4x4 vehicles and motorbikes with good suspension and tires.\n</p><p>Tirana:  New highway construction is underway (May 2017) in and around Tirana.  Until the highways are complete, the only way through Tirana is on secondary streets which are unbelievably congested and unruly.

Ask any police officer to point you in the right direction from Shkoder; they are helpful, courteous and friendly. The border crossing in the mountains (SH20) near Vermosh is accessed by a 30km section of unpaved mountain track (as of summer 2015), although there is construction work ongoing. This road is only suitable for 4x4 vehicles and motorbikes designed for off-road use.\n</p><p><b>There are multiple border crossings with Greece.</b> The biggest and most famous one is the <b>Kakavie</b> Border, which is about 45km from Gjirokaster.

This road can get you to many calm beaches in Greece and the city of Igoumenitsa. The border crossing <b>Tre Urat</b> is best used only if you are going to Permet or want to see some wonderful scenery; this border crossing is about 35km from Permet. Another important border crossing with Greece is <b>Bilisht</b>. This crossing is mainly used for traveling to Kastoria, Thessaloniki, Istanbul, and/or other parts of Eastern Greece. The closest major Albanian city from this border crossing is Korca at about 35km away.\n</p><p><b>There are two major border control points with Macedonia.</b> The most well-known and often-frequented one is <b>Qafe Thane</b> This border crossing is the fastest way to get to Ohrid, the Albanian parts of Macedonia and Skopje. This crossing is about 65km from Elbasan and 30km from Pogradec. The other border crossing, named <b>Tushemisht</b>, is the closest one to Pogradec at only 6km and is mainly used for tourists and locals who want to see the St. Naum Church and the Macedonian parts of Lake Ohrid.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_taxi\">By taxi</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: By taxi\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Albania is a small country and as such it is possible to leave the country by taxi.\n</p><p>Your hotel will be able to arrange a taxi to the border, where you should be able to change to a taxi on the other side. For example, a taxi from Tirana to the Macedonian border, a distance of 70 miles, will take three hours and cost about \u20ac100. A metered Macedonian taxi from the border to Struga should cost no more than \u20ac6 (December 2009) and take 20 minutes, while a taxi to Skopje would take 3 hours on much better roads and cost about \u20ac120 (prices January 2008). Getting through passport control will take about 30 minutes.\n</p><p>A taxi ride from downtown Pogradec to the Macedonian border at Sveti Naum costs about 5 euros and takes less than 10 minutes. After Albanian exit procedures, walk about .5km down the road to the Macedonian border control point. The beautiful Sveti Naum Church is very close by, and from there you can get a bus north around the lake to Ohrid (110 denars) (prices April 2010).\n</p><p>A taxi from Ulcinj in Montenegro to Shkoder in northern Albania costs about \u20ac30 and takes 1 hour. You do not have to change at the border; the taxi will bring you all the way (price June 2010).\n</p><p>Some taxis can take you into Greece; however, most will not go farther than Ioannina.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Get_around\">Get around</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: Get around\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_bus_2\">By bus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: By bus\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most people in Albania travel by public bus or by private minibuses (called <b>\"furgons</b>\"), which depart quite frequently to destinations around Albania. Furgons have no set timetable (they depart when they are full), and in addition to big cities provide access to some smaller towns where buses don't frequently run. Furgon stations aren't always in obvious locations, so you can ask around to find them, or keep an eye out for groups of white or red minibuses gathered together. Destination place names are generally displayed on the dashboard; prices are never posted. Furgons are loosely regulated and provide a real \"Albanian\" experience.\n</p>\nFrom <a href=\"/en/Tirana\" title=\"Tirana\">Tirana</a>, many furgons a day depart to <a href=\"/en/Shkoder\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shkoder\">Shkoder</a>, <a href=\"/en/Korca\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Korca\">Korca</a>, <a href=\"/en/Durres\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Durres\">Durres</a>, Elbasan, <a href=\"/en/Fier\" title=\"Fier\">Fier</a> and <a href=\"/en/Berat\" title=\"Berat\">Berat</a>.

Generally, furgons cost a little more and go a little faster than buses, but can be uncomfortable over long distances because of the close quarters with other passengers.

Tickets are very cheap, journeys are very long, and the views and the atmosphere are usually priceless. Among the things you will see along this unforgettable journey are people working their land with primitive tools, beautiful landscapes and wild terrains, houses under construction with various things hung on them to ward off the evil eye, and a chance to meet interesting passengers, mainly from rural areas. At most stations you'll find people selling sunflower seeds, fruits, chewing gum and many other different things.\n</p><p>Services operate between <a href=\"/en/Durr%C3%ABs\" title=\"Durr\u00ebs\">Durr\u00ebs</a> and <a href=\"/en/Shkod%C3%ABr\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Shkod\u00ebr\">Shkod\u00ebr</a>, <a href=\"/en/Fier\" title=\"Fier\">Fier</a>, Ballsh, <a href=\"/en/Vlor%C3%AB\" title=\"Vlor\u00eb\">Vlor\u00eb</a> and <a href=\"/en/Librazhd\" title=\"Librazhd\">Librazhd</a> via the Vor\u00eb junction.

Kashar is thus the closest rail station, at a distance of approximately 10 kilometres. The station was completely renovated in May 2015. Rail replacement bus services are reportedly operating between the old station sites at Tirana and Kashar, departing twenty minutes prior to the advertised train departure from the Kashar station.\n</p><p>Train timetables are available here: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.transporti.gov.al/files/userfiles/Transporti_Hekurudhor/Grafiku_i_Ri_i_Trenave_te_Udhetareve_(Maj_2015).pdf\">[7]</a>.\n</p><p>Albanian trains are still in relatively poor condition. Wealthier Albanians never use trains and, if not traveling in their own cars, use the many mini-buses. On the other hand, trains offer more space than the often overloaded minibuses.\n</p><p>Note that the train from Durr\u00ebs to Librazhd in eastern Albania (via Elbasan) takes about four hours. So instead of going up to Kashar from Tiran\u00eb to catch the train, you might want to consider taking a bus to Elbasan, which is only about 30 kilometers away.\n</p><p>No service has operated between Librazhd and Pogradec since 2012.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car_2\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Roads between important destinations have been re-paved and fixed recently and offer most of the security measures one would expect on a highway. There are no fees for using the highways. \n</p><p>Beware of minor roads: road surfaces can be poor, deeply pitted, or non-existent, and sometimes a decent paving can suddenly disappear, necessitating a U-turn and lengthy doubling-back. This is the case for the road between Tirana and Gjirokast\u00ebr. It seems that all the expensive cars in Albania are SUVs rather than low-slung sports cars - and for good reason. Consult the locals in advance if you are planning to travel away from a highway.\n</p><p>Highways have frequent changes in speed limit, sometimes with little apparent reason, and there are frequent police mobile speed checks. Police will stop you if you have not turned on your car lights. Police will often stop foreign cars (often owned by Albanian and Kosovan expats returned home), which seem to be good targets for extracting fines or other money. However, it seems that once the police recognize you as a foreign driver, they wave you on with minimal fuss, sometimes without even checking your documents. Expect to be stopped by police once per hour while driving in Albania (that frequently!). Beware of temporary lane closures and temporary rules such as no left turn which serve no apparent purpose but are watched by police who are ready to stop you if you misinterpret the confusing signs. Make sure you travel with a proper driver's license and insurance documents (ask your car hire company for these) to present to the police.\n</p><p>Car-driving behavior on the highways is not as orderly as elsewhere in Europe. Expect cars to pull out in front of you, little use of indicators, and hair-raising overtaking. Lanes on dual or triple carriageways tend to be observed. Also expect pedestrians, horses or donkeys to cross highways or walk on them. Especially beware of cows on the motorway.\n</p><p>Navigation is pretty easy, although some maps of the country are out-of-date or contain errors. It is strongly recommended to have an up-to-date GPS in your vehicle, as new roads are constantly being added to the Albanian road network. In case the GPS does not work, have a paper or internet-based map available as an alternative.\n</p><p>In the cities, especially Tirana, many roads are being upgraded and fixed. As a result, traveling by car inside the city is slow. Be aware that Tirana in particular suffers from great traffic congestion during mornings and midday.\n</p><p>The Vlor\u00eb-<a href=\"/en/Saranda\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Saranda\">Saranda</a> mountain road is a very nice ride. It is a typical Mediterranean road, and offers an amazing view of the sea from the mountains.\n</p><p>Gypsy and beggar children may approach your car at major stop lights. Nudge slightly forward to get them off your car and, if necessary, go into the traffic intersection to get rid of them. The locals will understand.\n</p><p>Note that around Greek holiday seasons, including Orthodox Easter, the roads leading to and from <a href=\"/en/Greece\" title=\"Greece\">Greece</a> can be crowded with cars with Greek plates of Albanian immigrants going to Albania or returning to Greece after their holidays.\n</p><p>Renting a car is a good option to choose, but the practice is fairly new in the country. Rental companies are available mainly at the Tirana Airport and in Tirana proper. Various travel agencies may offer such services as well.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_bicycle\">By bicycle</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: By bicycle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There is a lack of respect for people riding on bikes on the highways. Also, there are few places to put your bike. These and other challenges make Albania a difficult cycling destination, but a rewarding one. Often asking around to see if you can stay in somebody's home or camp in their garden is the only option. Food and water are easily available in the many roadside cafes and bars. \n</p><p>It is OK to camp in all not-strictly-private places, and even if a place is private, there should be no problem with your stay; just ask someone if you are in doubt.\n</p><p>Be aware that it's very hard to get parts or repairs for modern bicycles.\nBe careful with the dogs while riding bicycle... Many stray dogs walking the roads, some of them in groups and can be dangerous. Just like the dogs guarding the sheep and cows. That's why it's the best to travel in group or have something \"special\" for the dogs.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hitchhiking\">Hitchhiking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Hitchhiking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Hitchhiking is not very common in Albania; however, many people will pick you up if they are able.\n</p><p>Travelers can get assistance from Albanian travel authorities like <span class='vcard' id = 'Albanian_Tourism_Association'><span class=\"fn org\">Albanian Tourism Association</span> (<span class=\"nickname\">Albania Travel Assistance</span>), <a class=\"url external autonumber\" href=\"http://expatriates.pro/albania-travel-assistance-for-expatriates/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>. &#160;<a class=\"listing-edit\" href=\"#Albanian_Tourism_Association\" onclick=\"editListing('Albanian_Tourism_Association', 'listing', 'Albania');return false;\" title=\"click to edit Albanian Tourism Association\" rel=\"nofollow\">edit</a></span> and other non-government sector, too.

Note that the coastline stretching to the north from <a href=\"/en/Vlore\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Vlore\">Vlore</a> to the Montenegrin border is flat and contains sand beaches. This is the hub of mass tourism in Albania. You can visit seaside towns such as Shengjin, Durres and Vlore and enjoy the curative sands of Velipoje. To the south of Vlore, the Albanian Riviera is made up of rocky or gravel like shores with spectacular turquoise waters. The area contains mainly wooden villa complexes, bed and breakfasts, camping sites, and family owned hotels as accommodation facilities. Llogara Pass is a mountain pass located at the start of the Riviera near Llogara National Park which offers a majestic view of the riviera from above.

Most shops are open on Sunday.\n</p><p>Souvenirs: raki, alabaster bunker ashtrays\n</p>\n<table class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"3\">\n\n<tr>\n<th> Currency\n</th>\n<th> Amount\n</th>\n<th> Lek\n<p>Conversion\n</p>\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> Euro\n</td>\n<td> 1\n</td>\n<td> 136.8\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> <a href=\"/en/File:Us-flag.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Us-flag.png\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/25/Us-flag.png/24px-Us-flag.png\" width=\"24\" height=\"13\" class=\"thumbborder\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/25/Us-flag.png/36px-Us-flag.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/25/Us-flag.png/48px-Us-flag.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"103\" data-file-height=\"54\" /></a>US dollar\n</td>\n<td> 1\n</td>\n<td> 123.1\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> <a href=\"/en/File:Uk-flag.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Uk-flag.png\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/e/ed/Uk-flag.png/24px-Uk-flag.png\" width=\"24\" height=\"12\" class=\"thumbborder\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/e/ed/Uk-flag.png/36px-Uk-flag.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/e/ed/Uk-flag.png/48px-Uk-flag.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"108\" data-file-height=\"54\" /></a>pound sterling (UK)\n</td>\n<td> 1\n</td>\n<td> 163.5\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> <a href=\"/en/File:As-flag.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"As-flag.png\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/As-flag.png/24px-As-flag.png\" width=\"24\" height=\"12\" class=\"thumbborder\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/As-flag.png/36px-As-flag.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/As-flag.png/48px-As-flag.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"107\" data-file-height=\"54\" /></a>Australian dollar\n</td>\n<td> 1\n</td>\n<td> 91.6\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> <a href=\"/en/File:Ca-flag.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Ca-flag.png\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/c9/Ca-flag.png/24px-Ca-flag.png\" width=\"24\" height=\"12\" class=\"thumbborder\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/c9/Ca-flag.png/36px-Ca-flag.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/c9/Ca-flag.png/48px-Ca-flag.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"107\" data-file-height=\"54\" /></a>Canadian dollar\n</td>\n<td> 1\n</td>\n<td> 94.8\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>As of June 2016\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eat\">Eat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: Eat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Eat\" title=\"click to add a eat listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '27', 'eat', 'Albania');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Restaurants are very easy to find.  Albania, like the Balkans in general, has a primarily Turkish influence in its cuisine.  This influence stems from over 400 years of Ottoman rule in the region.  Recent influences after the fall of communism in the early 1990's have been from Italy and Western Europe in general.  Most of what is available in neighbouring countries such as Greece and Italy will be available in Albania, particularly in the larger cities.\n</p><p>Many people grow fruits and vegetables around their houses, most popularly all kinds of grapes, (red, black, green), that are used to make <i>raki</i>. \n</p><p>Albania is a very mountainous country, and these mountains have scattered olive trees that influence Albanian cuisine. Salads are usually made with fresh tomato and onion. Most Albanian people make their own bread, but going out for meals is very common.\n</p><p>Some sort of hearty stew is commonly included in Albanian dinners. These stews are easy to make, and flexible with ingredients. They include potatoes, onion, rice, etc. \n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>Byrek</b> - a type of savoury pie is also common, and is made in different ways. One way is with spinach and feta cheese. Another is with ground meat and onion. Baklava is a popular dessert and is always made as a dessert during New Year's Eve. If going to Albania, expect lamb to be the main meat in many places. Lamb there is naturally fed, and does not have any odor like it does in North America. Two byreks and an ayran is a very common breakfast, so try it to understand why.</li>\n<li> <b>Cheese</b> - lots of different types but mostly feta cheese. In village shops be prepared that you'll get the cheese in less hygienic way then in supermarkets but it's worth to try as it's usually delicious and in very good price (try those higher priced first). The \"Gjirofarma\"<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.gjirofarm.com\">[12]</a> feta cheese is similar to the Greek feta cheese, although a bit more expensive. However, most of the restaurants, especially in Tirana and the southern part of the country, use this cheese. Its very delicious, and its one of the few cheeses that are exported from Albania. </li></ul>\n<p>Lastly but not least, don't forget to check out the many pastry shops (<b>pasti\u00e7eri</b>) offering a wide variety of tasty pastry including delicious cakes.   \n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:352px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Ushqim_Tradicional.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//a/ae/Ushqim_Tradicional.jpg\" width=\"350\" height=\"300\" class=\"thumbimage\" data-file-width=\"350\" data-file-height=\"300\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Ushqim_Tradicional.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A table with Albanian traditional food</div></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drink\">Drink</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=28\" title=\"Edit section: Drink\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Drink\" title=\"click to add a drink listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '28', 'drink', 'Albania');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The legal drinking/purchasing age of alcoholic beverages is <b>18</b>.\n</p><p>The preferred alcoholic hard drink is <i>raki</i> that is locally produced in small towns as well as in many homes in the countryside; in some instances you may run across men washing down breakfast with a few shots.  Try the mulberry rakia - Albanians are the only people in the world that produce this drink with mulberry and plum, and its very delicious, especially around Gjirokaster. The number of homemade beers, wines and raki is as varied as the population itself; the quality of these drinks is as varied as the quantity available. Non-alcoholic drinks range from the well-known international and regional soft drink brands to the locally produced ones. You can find any type of soft drink in Albania, as well as natural mineral water,energy drinks, etc. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.qafshtama.com/\"><i>Qafshtama</i></a> water is especially good, and found in all of the country. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.pacaraboza.com/eng/\"><i>Boza</i></a>, a popular sweet drink made from maize (corn) and wheat is a traditional Albanian drink, and Albanians have been known as the best boza makers in the world.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sleep\">Sleep</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29\" title=\"Edit section: Sleep\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Sleep\" title=\"click to add a sleep listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '29', 'sleep', 'Albania');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Inside the cities, hotels are abundant and prices per night start as low as \u20ac15. Hotels are usually clean and their staff in major cities generally speak English and/or <a href=\"/en/Italian\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Italian\">Italian</a>. \n</p><p>Outside the big cities, hotels are less common, but in places like Gjirokastra can be excellent value (eg ALL1000).There is a great opportunity to experience local traditions, hospitality and cuisine by staying at one of the guesthouses in the North. The price of full board accommodation will not be more than \u20ac25 a person. If, for any reason, you find nowhere to sleep, the Albanian people have always been known for their hospitality, and will treat you like royalty as you stay with them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Work\">Work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30\" title=\"Edit section: Work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_safe\">Stay safe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31\" title=\"Edit section: Stay safe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Take the usual precautions. Foreigners are generally not targeted by the local crime scene, though pickpocketings do occur.\n</p><p>Take extra caution when driving, especially in big cities like Tirana. Most drivers drive like crazy and do not follow any round about rules, give ways, etc. They will also honk their horn constantly which can make any foreign driver even more nervous and frustrated. Just keep yourself calm and ignore the honking. Be careful of animals and little children crossing the roads.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>It's best to drink bottled water, but potted water is usually drinkable too. The food in Albania is mostly safe anywhere you go in the country, but in the summer be aware of possible high temperatures and inadequate refrigeration. You can walk around to stay fit, as many people do in the capital, but be aware that the city suffers from severe air pollution. In summer, insect repellent should be used, as the mosquito season is very active, especially near former swamps and along the Western Lowland. Be careful at the beaches because shards of glass and sea urchins are common on the sea floor. Health clinics in small towns or village areas are not well equipped, so trips to nearby cities can be expected. The government banned smoking in bars and restaurants in August 2014.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Respect\">Respect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=33\" title=\"Edit section: Respect\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Albanians are very hospitable. Even more so than in the rest of the Balkans, elder males expect to be shown respect on account of their age. Men of the family have to be respected in particular. Shake hands with them and do not argue about topics such as religion and politics. In the north, avoid topics that go beyond local understanding. On the other hand, rest assured that in Tirana you will find very cosmopolitan people who are as open to new and modern ideas as citizens of Western Europe are. Perhaps the most important thing to remember is to respect local people at least as much as you respect people back home.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Traditions\">Traditions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34\" title=\"Edit section: Traditions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Women kiss one another on cheeks , sometimes from the very first time they meet, but men and women do not kiss each other on the cheek unless they have been friends for a long time. If there is a baby in an Albanian family, always ask to see him or her, and don't forget to add a compliment (usually \"qenka i shendetshem, me jete te gjate\" or \"what a sweet baby\" works best). If you are a man, or a woman with a group of men, don't compliment females unless they are under 10-12 years of age.\n</p><p>If you don't speak English, but a language where \"you\" in informal and \"you\" in formal are not the same, be aware that some Albanians do not use the formal form in their language. Sometimes even the prime minister is adressed with \"ti\" if a journalist is a friend of his. However, when meeting people for the first time, it's better if you address them in formal form, although they will shortly after ask you to address them in an informal way.\n</p><p>Policemen in Albania are often polite. Police at checkpoints will very often stop foreign cars, many of which are owned by returning Albanians or Kosovars who are good targets for extortion. When police see that you are a foreign tourist, they will usually tell you to go on (usually with a \"ec, ec, rruge te mbare\" which can be translated in \"go on, have a nice trip\"). When this happens, it's very polite if you respond with a \"Faleminderit\" (thank you in Albanian).\n</p><p>Albanians love dancing, especially at weddings. If you are attending a party, don't be afraid to dance! Maybe you don't know the traditional dances, but try to learn.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cope\">Cope</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=35\" title=\"Edit section: Cope\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Electricity\">Electricity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=36\" title=\"Edit section: Electricity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Officially 220V 50Hz. Outlets are the European standard CEE-7/7 or the compatible, but non-grounded, CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" types. Generally speaking, US and Canadian travellers should pack an adapter for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Albania.\n</p><p>Unexpected power outages are common in Albania. These is largely dependent upon the amount of rainfall the country receives in any given year, as virtually all Albanian electricity is generated by hydroplants.However, this is becoming more and more rare. With the exception of Tirana, one can anticipate power outages in other cities. Although all major cities and most towns have back-up generators, it is best to err on the side of caution and ask beforehand whether or not the place has a generator to avoid risking(for example)getting stuck in an elevator.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact\">Contact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37\" title=\"Edit section: Contact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>You can buy a local sim card for ALL600 (Vodafone). You need to provide ID (passport, or ID card for EU/EFTA citizens) and give an address in Albania.  Though you may need to find a storefront (as opposed to Vodafone cards readily available from street vendors) Eagle cards work well and have very good coverage.  Eagle is the mobile branch of the government owned AlbTelecom.  As a result, Eagle cards offer significant savings when calling land based phones in Albania.  Being the \"Government\" carrier, be prepared for a bit more formality when getting one of these cards.  You will still need your travel document, but you will also need to sign several forms.\nAlso available from Vodafone is the tourist pack with 10GB data and 500 national minutes all valid for 14 days. The price is 10 Euro or 1300 ALL.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Get_out\">Get out</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Get out\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>You can go from Shkoder in northern Albania to Ulcinj in Montenegro by taxi or van. Fares can be negotiated between \u20ac15 and \u20ac20, and the trip takes between 1 and 2 hours. There are also three scheduled buses a day. From Ulcinj, you can take buses to some of the main cities in Montenegro, including Bar, Budva, Kotor and Podgorica. You can leave by plane from Rinas International Airport. You can go to Greece by Gjirokaster at the border crossing at Kavavi. You can leave for Italy from Durres or Vlora. From Saranda, you can go to Corfu, Greece. You can go to Kosovo from Kukes on the new highway. There are also border crossings into Macedonia. \n</p><p>Crossing into Macedonia at the border between Pogradec and Ohrid, Macedonia is fairly straightforward. From Pogradec, one can take a taxi to the border - this will likely cost around \u20ac5 and take around 10 minutes. Once you get to the border, it is possible to walk into Macedonia, but do not expect to find taxis on the other side of the border. Instead, hire a taxi on the Albanian side (\u20ac25, 40 minutes to Ohrid) or wait for the minibus that turns around at the border. This bus comes every few hours and is the same bus that services the Sveti Naum Monastery, which lies a few kilometers from the border. If the bus does not show up, your best option would be to head to the monastery's parking lot a few kilometers distant to find the bus (check Google Earth first to get a fix on its location).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Studying_in_Albania\">Studying  in Albania</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Albania&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39\" title=\"Edit section: Studying in Albania\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>You can go to Shkoder in northern Albania and study the Albanian language.

In the years to follow, conquistadors and navigators from the Spanish Empire gradually began to explore the area, setting up and abandoning various small settlements around the land. \n</p><p>The country soon became a successor state of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata, an overseas vice royalty of the Spanish Empire in 1776, setting up Buenos Aires as the capital city. In 1806 and 1807, the country managed to repel two invasions from the British Empire. \n</p><p>Following a long and bloody war which resulted in independence from <a href=\"/en/Spain\" title=\"Spain\">Spain</a> in 1816, the country experienced periods of internal political conflict between conservatives and liberals. In the first decade of the 20th century, Argentina became the richest nation in Latin America, its wealth symbolized by the opulence of its <a href=\"/en/Buenos_Aires\" title=\"Buenos Aires\">capital city</a>.\n</p><p>The vast wealth of the country attracted millions of immigrants, particularly from Italy and Spain, and to this day, Argentina is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world. Approximately 63% of the population has Italian ancestry. \n</p><p>After World War II, a long period of Peronist rule in subsequent governments was followed by a military junta that took power in 1976. Democracy returned in 1983 after the defeat of Argentina in the <a href=\"/en/Falkland_Islands\" title=\"Falkland Islands\">Falkland Islands</a> War against the United Kingdom the previous year.\n</p><p>A painful economic crisis at the turn of the 21st century devalued the Argentine peso by a factor of three and ushered in a series of weak, short-lived governments along with social and economic instability.  \n</p><p>However, later in the decade Argentina seemed to find some new stability, and currently has a much better economic outlook - albeit with the eternal problem of high inflation.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Electricity\">Electricity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Electricity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Argentine electricity is officially 220V, 50Hz. Adapters and transformers for North American equipment are readily available.\n</p><p>The best way to use imported electrical equipment in Argentina is to purchase an adapter once there. These are available in the Florida shopping area in <a href=\"/en/Buenos_Aires\" title=\"Buenos Aires\">Buenos Aires</a> for around USD2 or less in hardware stores outside the city centre. Buildings use a mix of European and <a href=\"/en/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australian</a> plug fittings. The Australian-style plugs are IRAM-2073, which are physically identical to the Australian AS-3112 standard (two blades in a V-shape, with or without a third blade for ground).  However, the live and neutral pins in the <a href=\"/en/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australian</a> fittings are reversed. Therefore <a href=\"/en/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australian</a> equipment may be incompatible despite the apparent plug-compatibility.  This is not a problem for battery chargers for devices such as Thinkpad, iPod, iPhone, and Blackberry. \n</p><p>European standard CEE-7/7 \"Schukostecker\" or \"Schuko\" outlets and the non-grounded, but compatible, European CEE-7/16 \"Europlug\" outlets may still be found in some older buildings. <a href=\"/en/United_States\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States\">US</a> and <a href=\"/en/Canada\" title=\"Canada\">Canadian</a> travellers may want to pack adapters for these outlets as well.\n</p><p>Many sockets have no ground pin. Laptop adapters should have little problem with this.  If  your laptop adapter requires a ground pin you will need a plug adapter that takes three pins from the laptop and requires only two from the wall socket.  This does work but may reduce electrical safety or affect your warranty.\n</p><p>Some Argentine sockets accept North American plugs, particularly ones on power strips. <b>Beware</b> - this does <i>not</i> mean that these sockets deliver 110 volts. Make sure that your equipment can handle 220 volts! Simply changing the shape of the socket with a USD2 adapter will not allow 110 volt equipment to operate on 220 volt Argentinian sockets, unless the device is specifically designed to work on both 110 and 220 volts, <b>irreparable damage and even fire can result</b>. Most laptop power adapters and many portable electronics chargers are designed to work on either voltage; check the specifications for your equipment to be sure. If your equipment cannot accept 220 volt current, you can purchase a '220 to 110' volt transformer for approximately USD6 in most Argentinian electronics shops. This is much heavier and bulkier than a small adapter.  There are two types of these transformers. One supports heavy loads for short duration, for example a hair dryer. The other supports light loads for long duration, for example an inkjet printer.  Do select the right one.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a

From 7 January 2013, ALL entries to Argentina at ALL ports of entry (except cruise passengers) have required pre-payment of the reciprocity fee at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.migraciones.gov.ar/accesible/templates/reciprocidad/reciprocidad.htm\">the Argentinian Department of Immigration website</a>.

If you fly into Argentina to an Argentine airport other than the two in Buenos Aires, you avoid paying the Reciprocity Fee (see above) payable by passport holders of Canada and Australia (and if you book your bags through Santiago to Mendoza you also avoid the similarly hefty Chilean reciprocity fee as well). \n</p><p>If you plan on visiting Buenos Aires you will fly into <b>Ministro Pistarini International Airport</b> (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:IATA\">IATA</a>: <b>EZE</b>); if you're travelling to another location in Argentina you may have to travel from Ezeiza to the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IATA\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:IATA\">IATA</a>: <b>AEP</b>), the domestic airport in Buenos Aires. One problem is that the airports are located on opposite sides of the city, so some time has to be factored when travelling from one airport to the other. There are cheap shuttle buses which take you there in about an hour, but travel time varies greatly depending on traffic. \nThere are few flights (mostly to R\u00edo Gallegos and Ushuaia), which leave early in the morning from Ezeiza International Airport. All the other domestic flights (and also to some South American destinations) leave from Aeroparque Jorge Newbery. <b>Be sure you are in the right airport!</b>\n</p><p>You should be able to ride a motorcoach or hire a service taxi from one of the booths after you clear customs. The rate for a taxi from Ezeiza international airport to Buenos Aires is around ARS500, the rate from the Jorge Newbery domestic airport to town is around ARS400.

Many find it far easier to travel to a neighbouring country and then take a short distance hop to the smaller airport. All major cities in Argentina and major tourist destinations like Mendoza, Perito Moreno and Iguazu Falls have airports nearby. There are several national airlines, with different levels of service. In general flying gets you everywhere quickly and relatively cheaply. Although the buses in Argentina are amongst the most comfortable in the world and are reasonably priced, travelling takes a lot of time because of the distances and slow road travel involved.\n</p><p>Passengers leaving Ezeiza Airport no longer have to pay the \"departure tax\" of USD29 (USD8 to Uruguay and domestic flights) after check-in, as they are now included in the prices of the tickets.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_bus\">By bus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: By bus\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>International coaches run from all the neighbouring countries.\n</p>\n<ul><li> Retiro Bus Terminal: +54 11 4310-0700</li></ul>\n<p>The Retiro bus terminal is large and hidden behind Retiro train and Subte stations.

Buses are comfortable (as comfortable as a 40 hour bus ride can be) but very expensive, much more so than in Chile and Brazil, let alone other South American countries. A bus ticket from southern Patagonia to Buenos Aires can easily cost you USD300. Flights also tend to be expensive, due to lack of competition. Flight fares are more expensive for foreigners than for Argentineans so ask at airline offices after you check tickets online.\n</p><p>More economical ways to travel around (besides hitchhiking <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://hitchwiki.org/en/Argentina\">[7]</a> which is straightforward, besides in the southern part of Ruta 40, between <a href=\"/en/El_Chalten\" title=\"El Chalten\">El Chalten</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Perito_Moreno&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Perito Moreno (page does not exist)\">Perito Moreno</a>), is to fly LADE, where possible or take a train on one of the few available routes. Both LADE and trains are subsidized by the government. During busy season (holidays etc.) and maybe also otherwise, there seems to be a silent agreement that Argentineans get a priority on those services. If you are told by LADE or the train operator that there is no availability for when you want to travel, ask a local to call and confirm. Some trains can be booked online. There have been reports of policemen and even ticket salesmen at Retiro train station in Buenos Aires turning foreigners away and not letting them into the ticket office, saying that there is no availability for the train for the next couple of months, which later turns out to be untrue. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_train\">By train</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: By train\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are trains from Buenos Aires to <a href=\"/en/Tucuman\" title=\"Tucuman\">Tucuman</a>, <a href=\"/en/Cordoba\" title=\"Cordoba\">Cordoba</a>, <a href=\"/en/Rosario\" title=\"Rosario\">Rosario</a> (from Retiro station), <a href=\"/en/Bahia_Blanca\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bahia Blanca\">Bahia Blanca</a> and <a href=\"/en/Mar_del_Plata\" title=\"Mar del Plata\">Mar del Plata</a> (from Constitucion station) among others.

Since regional train service is limited and plane tickets are more expensive, bus travel is the most common way to travel from city to city within Argentina. Note that it is not as cheap as it was before, with about 4 to 5 dollars for each hour of travelling (Puerto Iguaz\u00fa to Buenos Aires about USD100). \n</p><p>In Buenos Aires, a city bus is called a <i>colectivo</i> while a long distance, city-to-city bus is called a <i>micro</i>; but usage varies somewhat, they are also called omnibus. The hub of this network is definitely Buenos Aires' <i>Terminal de Omnibus de Retiro</i>; it has up to 2,000 bus arrivals and departures per day, and multiple companies serve most destinations. Buses arrive and depart from a total of 75 platforms, and in order to buy your ticket you will have to choose between about 200 ticket booths situated on the upper level of the terminal.\n</p><p>The more expensive buses generally offer high-quality service, and for distances longer than 200km, it is common to have food served on board. There is generally a good amount of legroom, and many buses have seats that recline horizontally into beds (<i>camas</i>) making them a lot like travelling business class on a plane. The best category with completely reclining seats is normally called <i>cama suite</i>, but this names vary, names such as <i>tutto leto</i>,<i>cama-vip</i>,<i>ejecutivo</i> or <i>salon real</i> are also in use. Somewhat cheaper seats only recline partially (<i>semi-camas</i>), or not at all (<i>servicio com\u00fan</i>). Every service belongs to one of five official comfort classes with minimum requirements that are prescribed by law in order to facilitate comparisons. The better buses will provide everything you need, while for the lower categories it may be a good idea to take drinks and food with you, as well as toilet paper and ear plugs.  If travelling with a large bag or suitcase bring a handful of 25c coins to tip the guys that heaves your pack in and out of the taxi and bus. If travelling long distances (let's say more than 12 hours) it is recommended to pay for a better bus service just because of travelling in a more comfortable way.\n</p><p>Remember that although buses usually arrive to their destination a little late, they almost always leave on time. Do not think that the relaxed approach carries over to bus departure times! \n</p><p>More information on bus companies and schedules is available at the webpage of the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.tebasa.com.ar/\">Terminal de Retiro</a>and at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.omnilineas.com.ar/retiro/\">[9]</a> in Buenos Aires. A second bus terminal in Buenos Aires is situated in the Liniers district, but it is smaller and less accessible than the one in Retiro.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Car rental is readily available throughout Argentina, though it is a bit expensive compared with other forms of transportation. Travelling by car allows you to visit locations that are hard to reach by public transportation. Patagonia, in the South of Argentina, is a popular driving location among tourists due to the breathtaking views across many miles of open land.\n</p><p>Argentina generally recognizes valid drivers' licenses from foreign jurisdictions. Drivers must be over 21. The rental companies will charge the renters card ARS6000 to be used in the event of an accident. They cancel this charge when the car is returned. On the <i>rutas</i>, in the provinces bordering other countries, the police frequently stop cars at <i>controles policiales</i> (\"police checkpoints\") to check insurance and registration papers and drivers' licenses. They do not stop all cars, though; when you come to a <i>control policial</i>, drive slowly and you will usually be waved through without stopping. Near provincial borders, these <i>controles</i> may also involve inspection of the trunk for contraband and a mandatory two peso fee for \"disinfection\" or \"de-insectifying\" the car's underside by driving it over a mechanical sprayer that either sprays water or does nothing. The police have been known to set up roadblocks and demand bribes for passage, particularly around the city of Buenos Aires. \n</p><p>Traffic regulations in Argentina are generally the same as in the US or Europe, but the local often ignore the regulations. On roads and highways it\u00b4s mandatory to have car lights on, even during daytime. Be aware that the driving style in Argentina is aggressive and chaotic. Pay attention at night.\n</p><p>Maximum speed: 60km/h in the city, 40km/h on side roads and 100km/h to 130km/h on roads outside the city as well as on highways. There are frequent speed controls. However speed limits and lane markings are universally ignored, and running red lights is common. Most drivers treat stop signs, octagonal red signs reading <i>PARE</i>, as though they were \"yield\" signs, though some drivers ignore them completely. Within cities surrounding Buenos Aires it is proper to honk at an impending intersection and the one who honks first has right of way. Right of way is determined somewhat haphazardly by a combination of vehicle size and who arrives first. Make sure you are thoroughly confident in your driving skills before attempting to drive in Argentina. \n</p><p>Highways are limited to the areas around large cities. Most of the country is connected by paved unlit two-lane roads (<i>rutas</i>) shared by buses, cars, and large trucks. Some places are accessible only by gravel or dirt roads - indeed, some main roads in southern Argentina are unsealed, leading to 4WD vehicles being more popular.  This is particularly the case in the south. It is important to travel with a good map ( e.g. <i>Argentina Waterproof Road Map</i> from World Mapping Project) and to be well informed about your route distances, road conditions and the estimated travel time. In addition to a good map the website of <i>cochera andina</i> publishes useful information on more than 120 routes in Argentina. \n</p><p>The current cost of gasoline in central and southern Argentina is approximately USD 1,2 per litre.  In many small towns, particularly in the north, they may ration gasoline to ensure they have enough to sell until the next refuelling truck arrives, in which case you will only be allowed to buy 300 pesos worth of fuel at a time. It's advisable to fill your tank at regular intervals when the opportunity arises. In the Andes, the gasoline consumption of non-turbo charged engines increases due to the altitude.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_thumb\">By thumb</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: By thumb\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"/en/Hitchhiking\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Hitchhiking\">hitchhiking club</a> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.autostopargentina.com.ar/\">Autostop Argentina</a> began in Argentina in 2002, inspired by clubs in France, Italy and the United States.

It's not uncommon to refer to one's friends as <i>boludo</i> (\"big balls\") or <i>loco</i> (\"crazy\"). \"Che\" is also used.\n</p><p>There is no such thing as political correctness in Argentina. In a colloquial speech between friends, larger people are unapologetically addressed as <i>gordo</i> (fat) and blacks as \"negro\"; Italians are <i>tanos</i>; Spaniards <i>gallegos</i>; Jews <i>rusos</i>; anyone Islamic as \"turcos\", anyone Asian <i>chinos</i> and the like. This sort of blunt address is considered somewhat normal in Argentina. Nevertheless, in the last years the use of the term <i>bolita</i> referring to neighbors from Bolivia and Paraguay is no longer accepted. Try to take it lightly, as it is usually not meant to offend, but don't copy it, because in certain circles this practice is considered racist and xenophobic.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>The official language is <a href=\"/en/Spanish_Phrasebook\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Spanish Phrasebook\">Spanish</a>. Generally, most people speak Spanish correctly, albeit using a local dialect, <i>Castellano Rioplatense</i>, which is subtly different from both the language of <a href=\"/en/Spain\" title=\"Spain\">Spain</a> and that of <a href=\"/en/Central_America\" title=\"Central America\">Central America</a>. Most notably, the pronoun \"t\u00fa\" is replaced by \"vos\", and the you plural pronoun \"vosotros\" replaced with \"ustedes\", the latter being common throughout Latin America. Besides, there are separate verb conjugations, sometimes significantly different for irregular verbs in present tense and informal commands. Additionally, people from each city pronounce words differently too! In this way, people from Buenos Aires speak differently compared to those from Spain and other Spanish speaking countries; example: <i>chicken</i> in Spanish (<i>pollo</i>) is pronounced <i>PO-zhO</i> or <i>PO-SHO</i> by the \"Porte\u00f1os\" (residents of Buenos Aires), with the <i>SH</i> sound harder than in Spanish; unlike most other Spanish speakers of South America who pronounces it <i>PO-yo</i>.\n</p><p>Rioplatense Spanish is also heavily influenced by Italian, even frequently being mistaken for it: is is a result of the large influx of Italian immigrants. Hand gestures derived from Italy are extremely common, and many colloquialisms are borrowed from Italian (for example: instead of saying \"cerveza\", which means beer, youngsters find \"birra\" cooler, which is in Italian). Most locals can readily understand most Spanish dialects, as well as Portuguese or Italian (especially due to its similarity to the local Spanish). English is mandatory in high school and usually understood in at least a basic level in tourists' areas. German and French can be understood and to some extent spoken by small fractions of the population. A few places in Patagonia near Rawson have native Welsh speakers.  Words borrowed from aboriginal languages include: quechua, guarani, mataco, che, mate and others. \n</p><p>The interjection \"che loco\" are extremely common and mean approximately the same as English \"hey!\". It can also be employed as a phrase known to someone you don't remember their names. Ex: \"Escuch\u00e1me, Che,....\" Sometimes it is peppered through out the speech, similar to the English phrase \"you know.\"  Nonetheless, communication will not be a problem for any Spanish speaker.\n</p><p>Argentines will communicate with each other using lunfardo, a street dialect or slang. It is used together with Spanish by replacing nouns with their synonyms in lunfardo. As opposed to changing the original meaning, it just makes the phrase more colourful. An important aspect of lunfardo is that it is only spoken. For example, one knows the word dinero (money), but may use the word \"guita\" in order to refer to the same things. Lunfardo is composed of about 5,000 words, many of which do not appear in the dictionary.\n</p><p>Despite the conflict with Britain over <i><a href=\"/en/Las_Islas_Malvinas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Las Islas Malvinas\">las Islas Malvinas</a></i>, Argentina still has the biggest British community in Latin America, and many private schools in Buenos Aires were founded by the British. Buenos Aires used to have the only Harrods store outside the UK and used to have the most important and oldest English newspaper in Latin America, the <i>Buenos Aires Herald</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See\">See</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: See\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#See\" title=\"click to add a see listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '22', 'see', 'Argentina');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Many <b>ski centres</b> operate in the <a href=\"/en/Andes\" title=\"Andes\">Andes</a> during the winter; <a href=\"/en/Las_Le%C3%B1as\" title=\"Las Le\u00f1as\">Las Le\u00f1as</a> and <a href=\"/en/San_Carlos_de_Bariloche\" title=\"San Carlos de Bariloche\">San Carlos de Bariloche</a> are particularly well-known. \n</p><p>There are two important <b>nature preserves</b> around <a href=\"/en/Puerto_Madryn\" title=\"Puerto Madryn\">Puerto Madryn</a>, Punta Tombo, and <a href=\"/en/Peninsula_Valdes\" title=\"Peninsula Valdes\">Peninsula Valdes</a> where one can see guanacos, rheas, penguins, sea lions, birds, and whales at certain times of the year.\n</p><p>The <b>wine regions</b> of <a href=\"/en/Mendoza\" title=\"Mendoza\">Mendoza</a> and <a href=\"/en/Salta\" title=\"Salta\">Salta</a> are also very popular tourist destinations, and many tourists are discovering that entering Argentina and using these cities as a base often suits them better than dealing with the bustle of Buenos Aires. <a href=\"/en/Mendoza\" title=\"Mendoza\">Mendoza</a> is a place where many find it is comfortable to learn or brush up on Spanish before touring South America.\n</p><p>The <b>Traslasierra Valley</b> is a natural geographic region of <a href=\"/en/Cordoba_(province,_Argentina)\" title=\"Cordoba (province, Argentina)\">C\u00f3rdoba</a>, <a class=\"mw-selflink selflink\">Argentina</a>, located west of the Big Picks or Hills where <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Mina_Clavero&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Mina Clavero (page does not exist)\">Mina Clavero</a> is the capital of tourism and is the most important commercial centre together with the city of <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Villa_Dolores&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Villa Dolores (page does not exist)\">Villa Dolores</a>.\nAmong this magnificent mountain range of almost 2800m (9200 ft), several charming villages will welcome you with a great variety of lodgings, restaurants, cultural events and outdoor activities for everyone. \nThe sun shines most of the year inviting you to practice eco-tourism and adventure tourism experiencing a direct contact with nature.\n</p><p>Health tourism is also possible in some places in Traslasierra valley, where alternative therapies or anti-stress programs are available in world class Spas. \n</p><p>Cultural heritage has also a main role, with museums, churches and estancias (ranches) of the eighteenth century.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Do\">Do</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Do\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Do\" title=\"click to add a do listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '23', 'do', 'Argentina');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Walking_Tours\">Walking Tours</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: Walking Tours\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Buenos Aires has a number of walking tour options.

On the Atlantic coast in Mar del Plata are a couple of courses that have held international events, and Patagonia has excellent resort courses such as Llao Lloa, Arelauquen and Chapelco (a Nicklaus design) as well as the 9-hole course in Ushaia.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Volunteering\">Volunteering</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29\" title=\"Edit section: Volunteering\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>There are several opportunities to engage in volunteer work in Argentina. Volunteer projects range from medical projects, building houses, teaching English to community development work.\nDifferent organizations and local NGOs offer these volunteering placements in Argentina. To get a better overview of all the opportunities available, it's best to have a look at a global <span class='vcard' id = 'comparison_platform'><span class=\"fn org\">comparison platform</span>, <a class=\"url external autonumber\" href=\"https://www.volunteerworld.com/volunteer-in-argentina/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>. &#160;<a class=\"listing-edit\" href=\"#comparison_platform\" onclick=\"editListing('comparison_platform', 'listing', 'Argentina');return false;\" title=\"click to edit comparison platform\" rel=\"nofollow\">edit</a></span>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Buy\">Buy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30\" title=\"Edit section: Buy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Buy\" title=\"click to add a buy listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '30', 'buy', 'Argentina');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The official currency of Argentina is the <i>peso</i> (<b>ARS</b>), divided into 100 centavos. Coins come in 5, 10, 25, 50 centavo and 1, 2, 5, and 10 peso denominations. Banknotes are issued in values of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1,000 pesos. There are several different versions of each banknote, especially the 50 and 100 peso banknotes.\n</p><p>Note that coins and small banknotes are rather difficult to obtain (Feb. 2016), so it is recommendable to focus on getting and keeping as much small units of Argentine money as possible in order to avoid complications if a cashier doesn't have the necessary change.\n</p><p>Receiving small change in the form of <i>golosinas</i> (candies) rather than increasingly rare 5, 10 and 25 centavo coins, especially in Chinese supermarkets and kiosks is common. \n</p><p><b>Credit card use in Argentina-</b> Some Argentine businesses accept credit cards only after adding a surcharge of about 10% (despite the well-known prohibition to do so). Many do so due to the high credit card charges local businesses receive. Travelers can expect to find that many businesses only accept debit cards and cash to avoid the high credit card fees they receive. Visa is the most commonly accepted, followed by Mastercard and the least being AMEX. \n</p><p><b>Currency exchange-</b> It is NOT recommended to buy Argentine pesos outside of Argentina. The Argentine peso has been unstable for years and most all countries will offer very bad exchange rates. ATMs are located in AEP and EZE airports for quick withdrawals. USD are the most widely accepted currency for exchanges within Argentina and fetch the most desired exchange rates.  \n</p><p>Otherwise buy cash US dollars in your country, as the USD definitely is Argentina's reference currency and therefore can be exchanged virtually anywhere and mostly at non-abusive rates, in contrast to most other currencies.\n</p><p>The EUR cash exchange rates within Argentina are rather less attractive than the USD rates. Bringing cash EUR to Argentina is therefore only recommendable if you already possess EUR (i.e. if you don't have to buy them with another currency).\n</p><p>From October 2011 till December 2015, the Argentine government had enforced strict foreign currency controls in an attempt to slow down the constant devaluation of the Argentine peso, making the the purchase of foreign currency nearly impossible. This created an unofficial exchange rate that had reached up to 55% more for foreign currencies than the official rate. In December 2015, this control of the official exchange rate had been abolished, which made the gap between the official and the unofficial US dollar (called <i>Dolar Blue</i> in Argentina) seemingly disappear (see <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.lanacion.com.ar/dolar-hoy-t1369\">http://www.lanacion.com.ar/dolar-hoy-t1369</a> ).\n</p><p>In the city centre of Buenos Aires, along Florida and Lavalle, currency changers call out \u201ccambio, cambio\u201d. They work for what are referred to locally as \u201clos Arbolitos\u201d. The running exchange rate is called the \u201cgreen\u201d rate. The down side here is you need to be educated on how to detect false bills. You're not going to get a stack of false bills, but you do run a risk of having a false ARS100 banknote interspersed in your stack of pesos. \n</p><p>If you have good contacts within Argentina you might be able to exchange your money at a \u201ccueva\u201d (cave), like most Argentines do, at the \u201cdolar blue\u201d rate. This is not an opportunity you should expect though, as cuevas are passed on by referral. You can also make some purchases in US dollars or euros but this only advisable for larger ticket items, and only in some shops. Some smaller hotels may be willing to give you a better rate if paid in cash US dollars or euros.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Counterfeit_Money\">Counterfeit Money</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=31\" title=\"Edit section: Counterfeit Money\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Counterfeit bills don't make it very far in Argentina. Counterfeiters are quite talented, but the residents are very good at spotting them. It's rare to be given a false ARS50 or ARS20 these days though it's not unheard of. All bank notes have a watermark in Argentina. ARS1000, ARS500, ARS200, ARS100 and ARS50 bank notes have a metallic thread incorporated into the paper. You should have enough to go by with just the watermark and the metallic thread.\n</p><p>If you have doubts you can use other safety features to confirm your currency is real. There are two ARS100 bank notes in circulation now. The original Roca ARS100 and the new Evita ARS100. The Evitas have the number 100 in red, centred along the right obverse (face) edge and 100 on the upper left  of the reverse. Rocas have a colour shifting 100 on the upper left obverse corner. Evitas have a metallic ink as well. Technically there are two versions of the Roca. The outsourced Brazilian press Rocas have their serial number in black on the bottom left of the obverse and the Argentine printed are in red along the left edge of the obverse. Another thing that may jump out in a counterfeit, is the feel. Paper without a cotton content feels different, and doesn't hold up well in daily use so is usually new. The ink on a real bill has texture as well, it's Intaglio printed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Clothing\">Clothing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=32\" title=\"Edit section: Clothing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The fashion and art scenes are booming. Buenos Aires' signature European-South American style overflows with unique art pieces, <i>art deco</i> furniture, and antiques. Creative and independent, local fashion designers - who are becoming a source of inspiration for the US and European high-end markets - compose their collections based on lots of leather, wools, woven fabrics, and delicate laces with a gaucho twist. At times, the exchange rate can present good value for international tourists. For example, in early 2006 the dollar and the euro were strong in comparison with the then-weak Argentina peso.\n</p><p>Fashionable clothing and leather products can be found in most commercial areas; jackets, boots and shoes are easily available. However, Buenos Aires has a relatively mild climate, so truly cold-weather gear is harder to find here.  Long coats or heavy gloves may not be in stock; similarly, jeans and other basics have a thin construction compared with those in cooler countries. The Andes regions and Patagonia are considerably colder in the winter, so thick clothing is much easier to find here.\n</p><p>Electronics are not cheap, as they are subject to heavy import tariffs.  The price of music, books, and movies lags slightly behind changes in the exchange rate and can offer a bargain if the volatile exchange rates are in your favour.   \n</p><p>Most free standing shops in Buenos Aires are open 10:00-20:00 on weekdays, and some of them also Saturdays and Sundays, depending on what area of the city they are in. Enclosed malls, however, set their own hours, and are also open on the weekends.\n</p><p>Most places outside of the city of Buenos Aires, where most stores remain open during a siesta, still observe a siesta from approximately 12:00-16:00; almost all businesses are closed during this time. The precise closing hours vary from store to store, according to the preferences of the owner. Shops and offices generally open again in the evening until 21:00 or 22:00.\n</p><p>If you want to use a debit or credit card, the checkout operator in places like supermarkets will require you to present both your card and a form of identification such as a drivers' license.  Present both simultaneously at checkout and with confidence.  A lack of confidence will lead to a request for your passport as identification. For larger purchases such as long-distance bus tickets you will need to present your passport and your credit card.  Although this makes shopping difficult, do try to keep your passport in a location such as a hotel-room safe.\n</p><p>As of 2011, unlike other parts of South America such as Peru, the credit card purchasing systems do not support credit card PINs. So, if you enabled PIN in your home country do not expect the Argentinian restaurant, hotel, or retailer to ask for you to key it in. Instead, they will ask for your signature, which is normal.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eat\">Eat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=33\" title=\"Edit section: Eat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Eat\" title=\"click to add a eat listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '33', 'eat', 'Argentina');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:ArgentinaSteak.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/22/ArgentinaSteak.jpg/300px-ArgentinaSteak.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/22/ArgentinaSteak.jpg/450px-ArgentinaSteak.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/22/ArgentinaSteak.jpg/600px-ArgentinaSteak.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2576\" data-file-height=\"1932\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:ArgentinaSteak.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>bife de chorizo</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Vegetable_empanadas.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Vegetable_empanadas.jpg/300px-Vegetable_empanadas.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"451\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Vegetable_empanadas.jpg/450px-Vegetable_empanadas.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Vegetable_empanadas.jpg/600px-Vegetable_empanadas.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2000\" data-file-height=\"3008\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Vegetable_empanadas.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Vegetable empanadas</div></div></div>\n<p>Argentinian breakfasts are somewhat light compared to what travellers from English-speaking countries are accustomed to. Typically, they consist of a hot drink (coffee, tea, milk) with some toast, medialunas (croissants, literally \"halfmoons\"), or bread.\n</p><p>Hotels typically provide a free buffet consisting of coffee, tea, drinkable yoghurt, assorted pastries and toast, fruit, and perhaps cereal. These kinds of breakfasts are also readily available in the many cafes.\n</p><p>Lunch is a big meal in Argentina, typically taken in the early afternoon. Lunch is so big because dinner is not until late: 20:30-21:00 at the earliest, more commonly at 22:00 or even later. Most restaurants do not serve food until then except for pastries or small ham-and-cheese toasted sandwiches (tostados), for afternoon tea between 18:00 and 20:00. Tea is the one meal that is rarely skipped. A few cafes do offer heartier fare all day long, but don't expect anything more substantial than pizza or a milanesa (breaded meat fillets) or a lomito (steak sandwiches) outside of normal Argentine mealtimes. Dinner is usually eaten at 22:00 and typically consists of appetizers, a main course, and desserts.\n</p><p>By the way, North Americans should beware that Argentinians use the term \"entr\u00e9e\" to refer to appetizers. This is common outside of North America but can surprise some Canadians and most Americans. Only in North America (outside of the province of Quebec) is the \"entr\u00e9e\" a \"main dish\". In Argentina the main dish is a \"plato principal\".\n</p><p>The entr\u00e9e in Argentina typically consists of <b>empanadas</b> (baked pastries with a meat filling), <b>chorizo</b> (with bread this is called a choripan, the most common street snack) or <b>morcilla</b> (meat or blood sausage), and assortments of achuras (entrails). For a main dish there is usually bife de chorizo (sirloin / New York Strip steak) and various types of salads. Dessert is often a custard with dulce de leche and whipped cream topping.\n</p><p>Beef is a prominent component of the Argentine diet and Argentine beef is world-famous for good reason. Argentina and Uruguay are the top 2 countries in the world in consumption of meat per capita. Definitely check out Argentine barbecue: asado, sometimes also called parrillada, because it is made on a parrilla, or grill. There is no way around it - foodwise Argentina is virtually synonymous with beef. The beef is some of the best in the world, and there are many different cuts of meat. Lomo (tenderloin) and bife de chorizo are excellent. \"Costillas\" (ribs) is considered by locals the real \"asado\" meat cut and is very tasty. North Americans will see that costillas are different to those at home. Argentinians cut ribs perpendicular to the bone. Having a parrillada dinner is one of the best ways to experience Argentine cuisine; preferably with a bottle of wine and a good amount of salads. In some popular areas, parrilladas are available from small buffets, or sidewalk carts and barbecue trailers. Skewers and steak sandwiches can then be purchased to go.\n</p><p>Given that a large portion of Argentines are of Italian, Spanish and French descent, such fare is very widespread and of high quality; pizzerias and specialized restaurants are very common. Argentines take pizza seriously and consider their pizza to be better than Italian or American pizza. The standout characteristic of Argentine pizza is the excessive amount of cheese in the pizza, usually not with much sauce and a very thick base (thinner bases are also commonly found depending on the pizzeria). You can order by the slice and eat standing up or order it whole at the table. Take note that a convention observed in Argentina is to treat the pasta and sauce as separate items; some travellers have found out what they thought was cheap pasta only to find that they were not getting any sauce. You will see the pasta for one price and then the sauces for an additional charge.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Alfajor_H.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Alfajor_H.jpg/300px-Alfajor_H.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Alfajor_H.jpg/450px-Alfajor_H.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Alfajor_H.jpg/600px-Alfajor_H.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2100\" data-file-height=\"1400\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Alfajor_H.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Alfajor</div></div></div>\n<p>Cafes, bakeries, and ice-cream shops (<b>helader\u00edas</b>) are very popular. Inexpensive and high-quality snacks can be found in most commercial areas, and many have outdoor seating areas. Empanadas (turnovers) containing meats, cheeses, or many other fillings can be bought cheaply from restaurants or lunch counters. The Alfajor is a must try snack of a two cookies with a dulce de leche filling and can be purchased at virtually any local kiosco. Every local have their favourite Alfajor brand but one of the most popular may be Havanna (which is also a coffee house chain or Argentina's Starbucks, and also sells their famous alfajores).\n</p><p>Heladerias in Argentina are generally of good quality and are almost similar to Italian gelato in texture and flavour. Popular high-end (but also high quality) chains are: Persicco, Freddo, Volta. There are cheaper chains like Grido but is usually considered as sub-par ice cream. There are also many individual artisnal helederias which make good helados. An Argentine idiosyncrasy is home-delivery ice cream. It is not uncommon to get home-delivered ice cream at 3am!\n</p><p>Smoking is now prohibited in most Buenos Aires' restaurants and all of Mendoza's restaurants. In some cities, it\u00b4s forbidden in all public buildings (caf\u00e9s, shops, banks, bus stations, etc), so it\u00b4s better to ask before smoking anywhere.\n</p><p>Tipping of 10% in restaurant is customary and expected, even if the bill includes a service charge and a table charge. Usually only applies to sit down restaurant with table service.\n</p><p>In the last years, there are lots of vegetarian and vegan options blooming in the city, although the most common plates are meat-based. If you don't want to eat any meat while you are in Argentina, be cautious with most of the street food locals, and always ask first if there is meat in the meal you want to order. You can end up with a bowl full of pasta with <i>churrasco</i> (a steak) on top. This is more true when you travel outside the city.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drink\">Drink</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34\" title=\"Edit section: Drink\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Drink\" title=\"click to add a drink listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '34', 'drink', 'Argentina');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Mate.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/0/00/Mate.jpg/300px-Mate.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//0/00/Mate.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"375\" data-file-height=\"500\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Mate.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mate</div></div></div>\n<p><i>Yerba mate</i> (pronounced in two syllables, 'MAH-tae') is a traditional Argentine herbal drink, prepared in a hollowed-out gourd which is passed around in a social setting and drunk through a metal straw. Though usually drunk hot, <i>mate</i> can also be served cold, usually known as \"terer\u00e9\". Terere is preferred by the populace in Paraguay. Mate contains less caffeine than coffee, but contains other vitamins and minerals that give it a stimulating effect, particularly to those who are not used to it. It is naturally rather bitter, so it's not uncommon to add sugar. The drinking of mate with friends is an important social ritual in Argentina. The informal tea ceremony is lead by a \"cebador\" or server and people arrange themselves in a \"rueda\" or wheel. Those who like the drink bitter and those who like it sweet are clustered together to aide the server. \n</p><p>Argentina is renowned for its excellent selection of wine. The most popular being Mendoza which is rated amongst the worlds most popular regions due to its high altitude, volcanic soils and proximity to the Andes Mountains. The terrain seems to complement the European grape varietals with interesting notes not present when produced in other climates, this allows the Argentine wine to be positioned in a league of its own. The best way to experience and understand the selection of Argentine varietals is one of the many tasting events. \n</p><p>Most restaurants serve a broad range of liquors. Beer is offered in draft form in a <i>chopp</i> (small glass) or served in bottles or cans, and is typically a light, easily drinkable lager. The most popular locally made brands of beer are Quilmes, Isenbeck, Schneider and Brahma (although it's Brazilian). Widely-available imports include Warsteiner, Heineken, Budweiser and Corona. There are now many small pubs and bars in Buenos Aires that brew beer on premises, but most of these offer a poor quality product compared to what is widely available in parts of the USA and Europe. In the Buenos Aires area, the Buller Brewing Company in Recoleta and the Antares Brewery in Mar del Plata offer excellent handcrafted English/American style ales.\nIf you ask if there are \"cervezas artesanales\" you will be able to find out if there are local handcrafted beers.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Fernetbranca.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Fernetbranca.jpg/300px-Fernetbranca.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Fernetbranca.jpg/450px-Fernetbranca.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Fernetbranca.jpg/600px-Fernetbranca.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"4035\" data-file-height=\"6055\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Fernetbranca.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Fernet</div></div></div>\n<p>Fernet is widely consumed by Argentinians, especially in C\u00f3rdoba, Santa Fe and Buenos Aires.

Avoid leaving bags unattended, wallets or phones on the edge of tables, flashing expensive jewelry and the sort. If you do happen to find yourself being held up just give the robbers what they want. Confrontational muggings are uncommon enough that one can assume the robber may be on drugs, drunk, have a knife or gun. In most cases, if your wallet is stolen, you won't even notice until hours later. Be wary of pickpockets on the subway and on crowded city streets. Never hang your purse or bag from the back of your chair in a cafe or restaurant - stealthy theft is common. Keep your purse or backpack on the floor between your legs or under a chair leg while you eat.\n</p><p>Popular demonstrations are very common in Buenos Aires, and very rarely violent, though you should exercise caution and observe them from a safe distance.\n</p><p>The dangers of hailing a taxi have received lots of press but are no longer common. Since 2005 the government cracked down on illegal taxis very successfully. Petty crime continues (like taking indirect routes, or less commonly, changing money for counterfeits). Taxicabs that loiter in front of popular tourist destinations like the National Museum, Retiro bus station, MALBA are looking specifically for tourists. Avoid them. Your chance of falling prey to a scam increases in these situations. Stopping a cab a block or two away on a typical city street where others locals would do the same is good choice. Also having small bills will help you avoid issues mentioned, as well you will often find taxis that don't have change for $500 and $100 peso bills. \n</p><p>Carry some ID with you, but not your original passport. A copy of your passport or perhaps your drivers license should be enough for credit card transactions or any situation that may arise.\n</p><p>Many people in the street and in the subway hand out small cards with horoscopes, lottery numbers, pictures of saints, or cute drawings on them. If you take the card, the person will ask for payment. You can simply return the card along with a <i>no, gracias.</i> or simply in silence if your Spanish is not good. Persistent panhandlers are usually not dangerous; a polite but firm <i>no tengo nada</i> (\"I don't have anything\") and/or hand gestures are usually enough.\n</p><p>Sidewalks are often uneven and poorly maintained.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Ezeiza_International_Airport_Security_Warning\">Ezeiza International Airport Security Warning</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Ezeiza International Airport Security Warning\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In July 2007, Argentina's TV network \"Canal 13\" conducted an investigation revealing that a group of security operators at the airport are stealing valuable objects such as iPods, digital cameras, cellular phones, sun glasses, jewelry and laptops while scanning the checked luggage of passengers. According to the special report, security operators at the airport should check each bag before putting it into the plane; however, some operators take advantage of the scanner machine to detect valuable objects and steal them. The report states that this event occurs every day and that the stolen items include anything from electronic devices to perfumes and works of art.\n</p><p><b>Travelers and residents are strongly encouraged to place high-value items in their carry-on luggage to prevent any incidents.</b>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Emergency_numbers\">Emergency numbers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39\" title=\"Edit section: Emergency numbers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li> Ambulance (<i>Immediate Health Emergency Service</i>, SAME in Buenos Aires and other cities): 107</li>\n<li> Firemen (<i>National Firemen Corps</i>): 100</li>\n<li> Police (<i>Argentine Federal Police</i>): 101 or 911 depending on the city</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Visiting Argentina doesn't raise any major health worries.  Certain vaccinations may be necessary for visitors, depending on where in Argentina you plan to visit.  Yellow Fever vaccinations are recommended for those visiting the Northern forests. Different climate conditions might take your body by surprise, so be aware of the weather before you arrive.  A bout of travellers' diarrhea is the most you're likely to have to worry about as your body adjusts to local micro-organisms in the food. It's also best to ease yourself gently into the local diet \u2013 sudden quantities of red meat, red wine, strong coffee and sweet pastries can be very unsettling for a stomach used to gentler repasts \u2013 and though tap water in Argentina is safe to drink, if sometimes heavily chlorinated, you may prefer to err on the side of caution in rural areas in the north of the country.\n</p><p>Although oral contraceptives are sold over the counter, without a prescription, a woman considering taking them is well advised first to consult a wise and licensed physician about their proper use, as well as possible contraindications and side effects.\n</p><p>There are public hospitals, which are free, and private hospitals (usually referred as <i>cl\u00ednicas</i>), which are not. In public hospitals they won\u00b4t charge you for any treatment, but it is customary to offer a contribution, if you have the means.\n</p><p>As of November 2012 there is advertising concerning preventive measures against dengue fever coming from Brazil and Bolivia in Argentina's northern regions. Locals from Tucum\u00e1n, Salta and Jujuy state there's generally not much danger but add that it is better to be safe than sorry. In summer season it is recommended to use mosquito repellent, especially in parks and green areas.\n<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever#Prevention\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dengue_fever#Prevention</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Respect\">Respect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41\" title=\"Edit section: Respect\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Argentines in general are very engaging and welcoming people. They are very proud of their country and culture, and once gained acquaintance, they become very warm and sincere. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_Etiquette_and_Breaches\">Social Etiquette and Breaches</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=42\" title=\"Edit section: Social Etiquette and Breaches\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li> Argentines are very engaging people who may ask very personal questions within minutes after first meeting someone. It's common to be asked very personal questions about your family, vocation, salary and or lifestyle, and don't hesitate to also do the same. It's considered good form as well as it signifies an interest in the other person.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Argentines are highly emotive communicators. It's common for Argentines to communicate things in a direct manner, both when telling good or bad things. What may seem like a public shouting match may actually be a passionate discussion or argument. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Argentines are humorous in a way that may seem abrupt or rude in other parts of the world. It's common for others to mildly attack your clothing or weight in a humorous manner, and this isn't intended to insult or degrade you in any way. Simply laugh it off, or reply back with another joke if the timing is proper. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Don't be offended if someone calls you a \"boludo\". Even though it's a swear word, in Argentina it means \"pal\", \"buddy\", or \"mate\" (depending on the tone it is said in). Argentine people are notorious for the amount of cursing they do, so if they are talking to you don't pay attention to the cursing. If Argentine are mad, teasing you or making fun of you, you will tell by the expression of their face or the tone of their voice as well as even more cursing than usual.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Don't be afraid of communicating with taxi drivers. Unlike in other parts of the world, taxi drivers are very friendly and are usually well informed. Feel free to talk about whatever you want, even if it is about the history and politics of the city in which you are visiting. Bear in mind that not many of them will speak in English or your native language, and thus a good command of Spanish is essential.  </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Cheek kissing is very common in Argentina among and between women and men. People make contact with right cheeks, and make a light \"kiss sound\" but not touch the cheek with their lips (only once, two kisses -right and then left- is only usual in Northeastern provinces). When two women, or a woman and man first meet, it is common to cheek kiss. Two men will first shake hands if they do not know each other, but will probably kiss when departing, especially if they have spoken for a while. Male friends cheek kiss every time when greeting, it is like a sign of trust. Trying to shake hands when offered a kiss will be considered odd, but never rude especially if you are an obvious foreigner. Remember when visiting another country its always interesting to try new customs. In the rest of the country, regular handshaking applies. </li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dining_Etiquette\">Dining Etiquette</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Argentina&amp;action=edit&amp;section=43\" title=\"Edit section: Dining Etiquette\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li> <b>Refrain from discussing business</b>.

Visit one of their many customer service branches in major cities with an unlocked American or European mobile phone and buy a SIM card for about 10 or 20 pesos. The  representative will sell you the card and insert it into the phone and register it using your name and passport number, to give you an Argentinian phone number. \n</p><p>The next step is to load the phone with credits, which must be purchased at a \"Locuritorio,\" a common storefront business offering phone booths, internet and more. Present your new phone number and your pesos to purchase time -- calls cost around 1 Peso per minute. These pay-as-you go SIM cards work for voice and text message, but not for data. For data you will need a plan and a contract, a much more complicated proposition. However, wifi is widely available in cafes. \n</p><p>Due to steep government duties, iphones and ipads are very rare in Argentina. We spent a bit of time trying to find a SIM for our iPhone 5 because it uses a nano-SIM that is much smaller than the standard. The company Personal was able to help us, with a special punch tool that cuts down the size of the chip to fit into the phone.\n</p><p>Receiving calls is usually free, <i>except</i> for international calls, and some cross network / inter-city calls - hence  to keep in touch with people abroad it might be best to get a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.kolmee.com/en/virtual-number-from?dest=ar\">virtual number service.</a> You can also use a free service such as Skype or Google Hangouts.\n</p><p>Voice coverage is good but data is pretty patchy and unreliable even in places where it normally works.

Dialing *444, pressing 2 followed by 1, and entering the secret number does the trick.\n</p><p>Not related to mobile phones, there are similar cards with credits for international calls. You get them at so called <i>locutorios</i>, where you can also use the phone booths. You dial a free number to connect to the service, then your secret number for the credits, and then the international phone number you want to call. Using these cards, a one-hour call to Europe will cost about ARS10 (USD3). Don't call without such cards or even from your hotel - it will be way more expensive.\n</p><p>The phone numbering plan in Argentina is hopelessly complicated for foreigners.

clearly distinguishes it from its larger neighbours. Bhutan is the only Vajrayana Buddhist nation in the world, and the profound teachings of this tradition remain well preserved and exert a strong influence in all aspects of life. Due to its pristine environment and harmonious society, the tiny Kingdom of Bhutan has been called \"The Last <a href=\"/en/Shangrila\" title=\"Shangrila\">Shangrila</a>.\"\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Understand\">Understand</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bhutan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Understand\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Bhutan is a unique country both culturally and environmentally. Perched high in the Himalaya, it is the world\u2019s last remaining Buddhist Kingdom. It has developed the philosophy of Gross National Happiness; where development is measured using a holistic approach of well-being, not just based on gross domestic product.\n</p><p>It is still termed as a third world country with subsistence farming practiced in much of Bhutan. In broad terms, the land is fertile and the population small. In addition, the current generation receives free education, and all citizens have access to free, although rudimentary, medical care. The sale of tobacco products is banned and smoking in public areas is an offense punished with fines.\n</p><p>Major sources of income for the kingdom are tourism, hydroelectric power and agriculture.  \n</p><p>While traditional culture has been very well preserved, the opening of the country to TV and internet in 1999 has had a major effect, and modern-day culture is mostly centered on bars and snooker halls. As a result, there is very little or no evidence of quality contemporary art, theatre or music. \n</p><p>Culturally, Bhutan is predominantly Buddhist with <a href=\"/en/Dzongkha_phrasebook\" title=\"Dzongkha phrasebook\">Dzongkha</a> as a national language (although there are regional variations - such as <a href=\"/en/Sharchopkha_phrasebook\" title=\"Sharchopkha phrasebook\">Sharchopkha</a>, the predominant language in <a href=\"/en/Eastern_Bhutan\" title=\"Eastern Bhutan\">Eastern Bhutan</a>), and a common dress code and architectural style. Bhutanese people primarily consist of the Ngalops and Sharchops, called the Western Bhutanese and Eastern Bhutanese, and Lhotshamphas (Southern Bhutanese), a people of Nepalese Gurkha Origin, respectively. The Ngalops primarily consist of Bhutanese living in the western part of the country. Their culture is closely related to that of their neighbor to the north, Tibet.\n</p><p>Because of the danger of their distinct culture being overwhelmed by Hindu Nepalese immigrants\u2014as had happened in neighboring <a href=\"/en/Sikkim\" title=\"Sikkim\">Sikkim</a>, which ended up being annexed by India\u2014some of whom had been in Bhutan for generations, many were expelled or fled as stateless persons to refugee camps in <a href=\"/en/Nepal\" title=\"Nepal\">Nepal</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gross_National_Happiness\">Gross National Happiness</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bhutan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Gross National Happiness\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>This ideology was the brainchild of King Jigme Singye Wangchuck who, having gained a modern education in <a href=\"/en/India\" title=\"India\">India</a> and the <a href=\"/en/UK\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UK\">UK</a>, realized that mere economic success did not necessarily translate into a content and happy society. Consequently, soon after his coronation in 1974, the young king began to float the idea of developing a new set of guidelines by which to govern the country. Slowly these ideas took shape, and in 1998 the GNH indicator was established. GNH stands for \"Gross National Happiness\" and is defined by the following four objectives: to increase economic growth and development, preserve and promote the cultural heritage, encourage sustainable use of the environment, and establish good governance. While the concept of GNH receives much international praise and is a major draw for tourists, potential visitors should be aware that the idea is very much in its incubation stage, and there is very little evidence of GNH in the country itself. \n</p><p>On 19 July 2011, 68 countries joined the Kingdom of Bhutan in co-sponsoring a resolution titled \u201cHappiness: Towards a holistic approach to development,\u201d which was adopted by consensus by the 193-member UN General Assembly.\nIn follow up to the resolution, the Royal Government of Bhutan convened a High Level Meeting on \u201cHappiness and Well Being: Defining a New Economic Paradigm\u201d on 2nd April 2012 at the United Nations headquarters in New York.\nThis meeting initiated the next steps towards realizing the vision of a new well being and sustainability-based economic paradigm that effectively integrates economic, social, and environmental objectives. Following this resolution, Bhutan continues to be a champion of the resolution and actively promotes the concept internationally.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bhutan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The first humans probably arrived sometime after the Ice Age, and little is known about Bhutan's prehistory. Historical records began with the arrival of Buddhism in the 7th century, when Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhava) visited Bhutan and established monasteries.  \n</p><p>In 1865, Britain and Bhutan signed the Treaty of Sinchulu, under which Bhutan would receive an annual subsidy in exchange for ceding some border land. Under British influence, a monarchy was set up in 1907; three years later, a treaty was signed whereby the British agreed not to interfere in Bhutanese internal affairs and Bhutan allowed Britain to direct its foreign affairs. This role was assumed by independent India after 1947. Two years later, a formal Indo-Bhutanese accord returned the areas of Bhutan annexed by the British, formalized the annual subsidies the country received, and defined India's responsibilities in defense and foreign relations.\n</p><p>In December 2006, King Jigme Singye Wangchuck transferred power to his oldest son, the Crown Prince Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, bestowing upon him the title of the fifth Druk Gyalpo. The official coronation took place in November 2008. The Fifth King is Boston and Oxford educated and is held in high esteem throughout the country.\n</p>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Guru Rinpoche</b><br />\nIt is not possible to travel far in Bhutan without seeing images of a man wearing a tall elaborate hat and with eyes that are open wide and staring forward into space.  This is the great 8th century sage of Vajrayana Buddhism, Padmasambhava or Guru Rinpoche as he often called. According to legend, Padmasambhava was reincarnated into a lotus blossom as an eight-year-old child, and from very young he possessed great wisdom and insight.  Furthermore, he had mastery of the elements and so like a potter manipulating basic clay and turning it into beautiful pots, he was able to transform harmful action and substances into something positive and beneficial. \n</p><p>Guru Rinpoche's special association with Bhutan began when he traveled to the town now known as <a href=\"/en/Jakar\" title=\"Jakar\">Jakar</a> at the invitation of a local king to subjugate negative forces. The mission was a success, and from this encounter, Buddhism spread throughout the land. A body print of the great sage exists to this day at Kurjey Lhakhang in Jakar, and he is also associated with many other sacred sites in Bhutan, with perhaps the most notable being the cliff-hanging Taktshang Monastery in <a href=\"/en/Paro\" title=\"Paro\">Paro</a>.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Climate\">Climate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bhutan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Climate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Although geographically quite small, Bhutan\u2019s weather varies from north to south and valley to valley, mainly depending upon the elevation. In the North of Bhutan on the borders with Tibet, the country is perennially covered with snow. In the western, central and eastern Bhutan (Ha, Paro, Thimphu, Wandue, Trongsa, Bumthang, Trashi Yangtse, Lhuntse) you will mostly experience European-like weather.  Winter lasts here from November to March. Punakha is an exception as it is in a lower valley and summer is hot and winter is pleasant.  Southern Bhutan bordering with India is hot and humid with a sub-tropical climate. While the monsoon affects northern Indian it does not command the same influence in Bhutan.  Summer months tend to be wetter with isolated showers predominately in the evenings only.  Winter is by far the driest period while spring and autumn tend to be pleasant.\n</p><p>There are four distinct seasons similar in their divisions to those of Western Europe. Temperatures in the far south range from 15\u00b0C in winter (December to February) to 30\u00b0C in summer (June to August).

There are direct shared taxis from NJP to Jaigaon or there is the option of buses from Siliguri bus station. A taxi between the station and the bus station costs around 80rs max. Alternatively you can also take a local train to Hasimara which costs around Rs40 and takes around 3 hours.  Trains from NJP should be booked ahead, as it is a popular stations amongst locals. There are not any trains leaving from this station with a tourist quota.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> 'New Alipurduar' (NOQ) railway station is a better option than New Jalpaiguri if you want to reduce your road journey to Jaigaon. From here, Jaigaon is only about 60 kms and can be covered in about 1 hour 15 minutes by a direct taxi. Alternatively, bus services from New Alipur Duar town to Jaigaon are also available.

However, most drivers require nothing, and are more than happy just to have some company and the opportunity to make a new friend. If you plan to hitch a lot (and in some rural areas there is no other way to get around), it is a good idea to take a few small gifts to offer the drivers as an expression of your appreciation.

the walks are generally quite tough as there are no places to stay or eat in the higher regions, and so all food and camping equipment must be carried in. The autumn and spring are the best seasons for undertaking a trek. In the summer, the paths are too muddy, while in winter they are snow covered. However, despite the difficulties of the treks, all efforts and discomforts are more than compensated for by the stunning scenery and extremely friendly, gentle and hospitable people that are met along the way. See: <a href=\"/en/Wilderness_backpacking\" title=\"Wilderness backpacking\">Wilderness backpacking</a>.</li>\n<li><b>Festivals:</b> Tshechu is the largest religious festival in Bhutan and is celebrated in the late Summer and Fall throughout the country (see city articles for local information), though Thimphu Tshechu is the most famous and attracts around 30,000 people. The highlight of the tshechu ceremonies is the masked dances by monks, which were developed according to precise instructions given by past Buddhist masters. According to Buddhist philosophy, all experiences leave an imprint in the mind stream that  produces a corresponding result in the future, and so viewing these dances, which are imbued with sacred symbolism, is considered to be a very auspicious and sanctifying experience. While the event is not held in a solemn atmosphere and there is much merriment, visitors are reminded that it is still a religious festival that is of great importance to Bhutanese people, and so appropriate behaviour is expected. See <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https://www.triip.me/paro/bhutan-culture-4492/\">Bhutan Culture</a> </li>\n<li><b>Archery</b>: This is the national sport of Bhutan and competitions are held throughout the country at most weekends. Visitors are very welcome to watch and also to add voice to the boisterous cheering that accompanies these events.</li>\n<li><b>Biking</b>: There is no better way to experience a place than by bike.  Bhutan's expansive wilderness, small sleepy cities, rural farmland, tiny roads, majestic views, and everything else is that much sweeter on a bike. Biking isn't easy though, being in the Himalayas it requires long climbs at higher altitudes than most travelers are accustom to, followed by long descents down roads rarely wide enough for two cars.  Roads are safe away from major cities, and are mostly smooth and a times feels like a bike lane in the middle of nowhere until a large decorated dump truck comes roving around a tight corner. Biking is easily the most sociable way to and experience Bhutan, locals come up and talk to you, and you have a chance to soak up the settings at your on pace, not that of a rushed driver.

The burning rocks heats the water gradually and thus release minerals in to the water. Traditionally these bath are done near a river bed with plenty supplies of stones and water and preferably after dark in the open air.</li>\n<li><b>Ceremonial Buddhist Weddings</b>:Bhutanese wedding is profound experience and commemorates the celestial union of mind, body and soul of two people. More than just a simple exchange of vows and rings, it entails conducting, set of religious rituals by monks as per Buddhist norms. This rituals signifies the important of bond between partners and importantly bestows upon them the protecting and blessing of Gurus and sentient beings, for a life time of love and happiness.

Dzongkha is the main language spoken in Western Bhutan, with nearly two-dozen other Sino-Tibetan languages being spoken across the country, including <a href=\"/en/Sharchopkha_phrasebook\" title=\"Sharchopkha phrasebook\">Sharchopkha</a> in the east and <a href=\"/en/Bumthangkha_phrasebook\" title=\"Bumthangkha phrasebook\">Bumthangkha</a> in Bhumthang.\n</p><p>Most Bhutanese can also speak <a href=\"/en/Nepali_phrasebook\" title=\"Nepali phrasebook\">Nepali</a>, which is the native language of most Bhutanese who reside in the south of the country. \n</p><p>Owing to the presence of Indian media and trade, most people in urban areas also understand English and/or <a href=\"/en/Hindi_phrasebook\" title=\"Hindi phrasebook\">Hindi</a>.\n</p><p><b>Quotes unique to Bhutan</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>La</b>. The suffix 'la' is an <b>honorific</b>, and many Bhutanese feel that their remarks sound too harsh if it is not used, and this carries over even into English. So, don't be surprised if you hear expressions such as \"Yes-la\" or \"I'm not sure-la\". It just implies respect. </li>\n<li><b>Reach</b>. In Bhutan, the verb 'reach' means to 'take' or 'accompany' (a person). For example: \"I'll reach you to the bus station\" means \"I'll take/accompany you to the bus station.\"</li>\n<li><b>Cousin-brother, Cousin-sister</b>. Extended families living under one roof are common in Bhutan. As a result, the dividing line between siblings and cousins is blurred, and so it is not uncommon to be introduced to a \"cousin-brother\" or \"cousin-sister\". Although these people are just cousins, the English word implies a more distant relationship than is the fact in Bhutan.</li>\n<li><b>BST</b>. The exact meaning of this phrase is 'Bhutan Standard Time', but as Bhutanese people are notorious for being late or just not turning up at all, it has taken on the meaning of 'Bhutan Stretchable Time'. Therefore, when someone arrives late, they will often excuse themselves by saying that they are running on BST.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Buy\">Buy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bhutan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Buy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Buy\" title=\"click to add a buy listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '38', 'buy', 'Bhutan');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Currency\">Currency</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bhutan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39\" title=\"Edit section: Currency\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The official currency is the <b>ngultrum (Nu.)</b>, which is pegged 1:1 with the Indian rupee (\u20b9).

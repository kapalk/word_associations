Through the recent economic boom initiated by the reforms of Deng Xiaoping, China is once again one of the leading nations in the world, buoyed by its large, industrious population and abundant natural resources. The depth and complexity of the Chinese civilization, with its rich heritage, has fascinated Westerners such as <a href=\"/en/On_the_trail_of_Marco_Polo\" title=\"On the trail of Marco Polo\">Marco Polo</a> and Gottfried Leibniz through the Great <a href=\"/en/Silk_Road\" title=\"Silk Road\">Silk Road</a> and more ways of culture exchange in centuries past, and will continue to excite - and bewilder - the traveler today.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The recorded history of Chinese civilization can be traced to the Yellow River valley, said to be the 'cradle of Chinese civilization'. The Xia Dynasty was the first dynasty to be described in ancient historical chronicles, though to date, no concrete proof of its existence has been found. Nevertheless, archaeological evidence has shown that at the very least, an early bronze age Chinese civilization had developed by the period described.\n</p><p>The <b>Shang Dynasty</b>, China's first historically confirmed dynasty, and the <b>Zhou Dynasty</b> ruled across the Yellow River basin. The Zhou adopted a decentralized system of government, in which the feudal lords ruled over their respective territories with a high degree of autonomy, even maintaining their own armies, while at the same time paying tribute to the king and recognizing him as the symbolic ruler of China. It was also the longest ruling dynasty in Chinese history, lasting about 800 years. Despite this longevity, during the second half of the Zhou period, China descended into centuries of political turmoil, with the feudal lords of numerous small fiefdoms vying for power during the <b>Spring and Autumn Period</b>, and later stabilized into seven large states in the <b>Warring States period.</b> This tumultuous period gave birth to China's greatest thinkers including Confucius, Mencius and Laozi, who made substantial contributions to Chinese thought and culture.\n</p><p>China was eventually unified in 221 BC by Qin Shi Huang, the 'First Emperor', and the <b>Qin Dynasty</b> instituted a centralized system of government for all of China, and standardized weights and measures, Chinese characters and currency in order to create unity. Until today, the ideal of a unified and strong centralized system is still strong in Chinese thought. However, due to despotic and harsh rule, the Qin dynasty lasted for only 15 years as the <b>Han Dynasty</b> took over in 206BC after a period of revolt. With the invention of paper and extensive trade with the West along the Silk Road, along with relatively benevolent imperial rule, the Han was the first golden age of Chinese civilization. Ethnic Chinese consider themselves to be part of the 'Han' race till this day. \n</p><p>The collapse of the Han Dynasty in 220 CE led to a period of political turmoil and war known as the <b>Three Kingdoms Period</b>, which saw China split into the three separate states of Wei, Shu and Wu. Despite lasting for only about 60 years, it is a highly romanticised period of Chinese history. China was then briefly reunified under the <b>Jin Dynasty</b>, before descending into a period of division and anarchy once again. The era of division culminated with the <b>Sui</b> which reunified China in 581. The Sui were famous for major public works projects, such as the engineering feat of the Grand Canal, which linked Beijing in the north to Hangzhou in the south. Certain sections of the canal are still navigable today.\n</p><p>Bankrupted by war and excess government spending, the Sui were supplanted by the <b>Tang Dynasty</b>, ushering in the second golden age of Chinese civilization, marked by a flowering of Chinese poetry, Buddhism and statecraft, and also saw the development of the Imperial Examination system which attempted to select court officials by ability rather than family background. Chinatowns overseas are often known as \"Street of the Tang People\" (\u5510\u4eba\u8857 T\u00e1ngr\u00e9n ji\u0113) in Chinese. The collapse of the Tang Dynasty then saw China divided once again, until it was reunified by the <b>Song Dynasty</b>, this collapse was preceded by the secession and independence of <b>Vietnam</b> in 938 CE. The Song ruled over most of China for over 150 years before being driven south of the Huai river by the Jurchens, were they continued to rule as the Southern Song, and although militarily weak, attained a level of commercial and economic development unmatched until the West's Industrial Revolution. The <b>Yuan (Mongol) dynasty</b> first defeated the Jurchens, then proceeded to conquer the Song in 1279, and ruled their vast Eurasian empire from modern-day Beijing.\n</p><p>After defeating the Mongols, the <b>Ming dynasty</b> (1368-1644) re-instituted rule by ethnic Han. The Ming period was noted for trade and exploration, with Zheng He's numerous voyages to Southeast Asia, India and the Arab world. Initial contact with European traders meant China gradually reaped the fruits of the Colombian exchange, with silver pouring in by the galleon through trade with the Portuguese and Spanish. Famous buildings in Beijing, such as the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven, were built in this period. The last dynasty of the <b>Qing (Manchu) dynasty</b> (1644-1911), saw the Chinese empire grow to its current size, incorporating the western regions of Xinjiang and Tibet. The Qing dynasty fell into decay in its final years to become the 'sick man of Asia', where it was nibbled apart by Western powers. The Westerners established their own treaty ports in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Tianjin. China lost several territories to foreign powers; Hong Kong and Weihai were ceded to Britain, Taiwan and Liaodong were to Japan, parts of the North East including Dalian and parts of Outer Manchuria to Russia, while Qingdao was ceded to Germany. Shanghai was divided among China and eight different countries. In addition, China lost control of its tributaties, with Korea and the Ryukyu Islands ceded to Japan.\n</p><p>The two thousand-year old imperial system collapsed in 1911, where Sun Yat-Sen (\u5b59\u4e2d\u5c71, S\u016bn Zh\u014dngsh\u0101n) founded the <b>Republic of China</b> (\u4e2d\u534e\u6c11\u56fd Zh\u014dnghu\u00e1 M\u00edngu\u00f3). Central rule collapsed in 1916 after Yuan Shih-kai, the second president of the Republic and self-declared emperor, passed away; China descended into anarchy, with various self-serving warlords ruling over different regions of China. In 1919, student protests in Beijing gave birth to the \"May Fourth Movement\" (\u4e94\u56db\u8fd0\u52a8 W\u01d4 S\u00ec Y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng), which espoused various reforms to Chinese society, such as the use of the vernacular in writing, as well as the development of science and democracy. The intellectual ferment of the May Fourth Movement gave birth to the reorganized <b>Kuomintang</b> (KMT) in 1919 and the <b>Chinese Communist Party</b> (CCP) in the French Concession in Shanghai, 1921.\n</p><p>After uniting much of eastern China under KMT rule in 1928, the CCP and the KMT turned on each other, with the CCP fleeing to Yan'an in Shaanxi in the epic <a href=\"/en/Long_March\" title=\"Long March\">Long March</a>. During the period from 1922 to 1937, The eastern provinces of China grew economically under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek and his KMT government, with marked economic expansion, industrialization and urbanization. Shanghai became a truly cosmopolitan city, as one of the world's busiest ports, and the most prosperous city in East Asia, home to millions of Chinese and 60,000 foreigners from all corners of the globe. However, underlying problems throughout the vast country side, particularly the more inland parts of the country, such as civil unrest, famines and warlord conflict, still remained. \n</p><p>Japan established a puppet state under the name Manchukuo in Manchuria in 1931, and invaded mainland china in 1937. After fleeing west to Chongqing, the KMT realized the urgency of the situation signed a tenuous agreement with the CCP to form a second united front against the Japanese. With the defeat of Japan in 1945, the KMT and CCP armies maneuvered for positions in north China, setting the stage for the civil war in the years to come. The civil war lasted from 1946 to 1949 and ended with the Kuomintang defeated and sent packing to Taiwan where they hoped to re-establish themselves and recapture the mainland some day.\n</p><p>Mao Zedong officially declared the establishment of the <b>People's Republic of China</b> on 1 Oct 1949.  The new Communist government implemented strong measures to restore law and order and revive industrial, agricultural and commercial institutions reeling from more than a decade of war. By 1955, China's economy had returned to pre-war levels of output as factories, farms, labor unions, civil society and governance were brought under Party control. After an initial period closely hewing to the Soviet model of heavy industrialization and comprehensive central economic planning, China began to experiment with adapting Marxism to a largely agrarian society.\n</p><p>Massive social experiments such as the Hundred Flowers Campaign (\u767e\u82b1\u8fd0\u52a8 b\u01ceihu\u0101 y\u00f9nd\u00f2ng), the Great Leap Forward (\u5927\u8dc3\u8fdb d\u00e0yu\u00e8j\u00ecn), intended to collectivize and industrialize China quickly, and the Cultural Revolution (\u65e0\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u6587\u5316\u5927\u9769\u547d w\u00fach\u01cen ji\u0113j\u00ed w\u00e9nhu\u00e0 d\u00e0 g\u00e9m\u00ecng), aimed at changing everything by discipline, destruction of the \"Four Olds,\" and total dedication to Mao Zedong Thought, rocked China from 1957 to 1976. The Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution are generally considered disastrous failures in China. During the Cultural Revolution in particular, China's cultural heritage, including monuments, temples, historical artifacts, and works of literature sustained catastrophic damage at the hands of Red Guard factions. It was only due to the intervention of Zhou Enlai and the PLA that major sites, such as the Potala Palace, the Mogao Caves, and the Forbidden City escaped destruction during the Cultural Revolution. \n</p><p>Mao Zedong died in 1976, and in 1978, Deng Xiaoping became China's paramount leader. Deng and his lieutenants gradually introduced market-oriented reforms and decentralized economic decision making. Economic output quadrupled by 2000 and continues to grow by 8-10% per year, but huge problems remain &#8212; bouts of serious inflation, regional income inequality, human rights abuses, ethnic unrest, massive pollution, rural poverty and corruption. While the larger cities near the coast like <a href=\"/en/Beijing\" title=\"Beijing\">Beijing</a>, <a href=\"/en/Shanghai\" title=\"Shanghai\">Shanghai</a> and <a href=\"/en/Guangzhou\" title=\"Guangzhou\">Guangzhou</a> have grown to become rich and modern, many of the more inland and rural parts of the country remain poor and underdeveloped. The former General Secretary of the Communist Party, Hu Jintao, has proclaimed a policy for a \"Harmonious Society\" (\u548c\u8c10\u793e\u4f1a h\u00e9xi\u00e9 sh\u00e8hu\u00ec) which promises to restore balanced economic growth and channel investment and prosperity into China's central and western provinces, which have been largely left behind in the post-1978 economic boom. The current General Secretary of the Communist Party, Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang, have pursued an ambitious policy of social reform, particularly income redistribution, poverty relief, and environmental improvements. Furthermore, a highly ambitious crackdown on corruption started by the previous administration has only been expanded. Growth in China has finally slowed down in recent years and seems to be leveling off.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Politics\">Politics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Politics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>China is a single-party socialist state ruled by the Communist Party of China.  China has actually only experienced one open nation-wide election, in 1912. The government consists of an executive branch known as the State Council (\u56fd\u52a1\u9662 Gu\u00f3 W\u00f9 Yu\u00e0n), as well as a unicameral legislature known as the National People's Congress (\u5168\u56fd\u4eba\u6c11\u4ee3\u8868\u5927\u4f1a Qu\u00e1ngu\u00f3 R\u00e9nm\u00edn D\u00e0ibi\u01ceo D\u00e0hu\u00ec). The nominal Head of State is the President (\u4e3b\u5e2d zh\u01d4x\u00ed, <i>lit chairman</i>) which is a largely ceremonial office with limited powers and the Head of Government is the Premier (\u603b\u7406 z\u01d2ngl\u01d0). In practice, while neither one holds absolute power, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China holds the most power, while the Premier of the State Council is the second most powerful person in the country.\n</p><p>The country is administratively divided into 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions and 4 directly-controlled municipalities. Each of the provincial governments is given power over the internal, often economic, affairs of their provinces. Autonomous regions are given more freedom than regular provinces, one example of which is the right to declare additional official languages in the region besides Mandarin. In addition, there are the Special Administrative Regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macau. Both Hong Kong and Macau have separate legal systems and immigration departments from the mainland, and are given the freedom to enact laws separately from the mainland. Their political systems are more open and directly electoral in nature. Taiwan is also claimed by the PRC as a province, though no part of Taiwan is currently under the control of the PRC. Both governments support re-unification in principle and recently signed a trade pact to closer link their economies, essentially removing the danger of war.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"People_and_Habits\">People and Habits</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: People and Habits\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>China is a diverse place with large variations in culture, language, customs and economic levels. The economic landscape is particularly diverse. The major cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Shanghai are modern and comparatively wealthy. However, about 50% of Chinese still live in rural areas even though only 10% of China's land is arable. Hundreds of millions of rural residents still farm with manual labour or draft animals. Some 200 to 300 million former peasants have migrated to townships and cities in search of work. Government estimates for 2005 reported that 90 million people lived on less than \u00a5924 a year and 26 million were under the official poverty line of \u00a5668 a year. Generally the southern and eastern coastal regions are more wealthy while inland areas, the far west and north, and the southwest are much much less developed.\n</p><p>The cultural landscape is unsurprisingly very diverse given the sheer size of the country. China has 56 officially recognized ethnic groups; the largest by far is the Han which comprise over 90% of the population. The other 55 groups enjoy affirmative action for university admission and exemption from the one-child policy. The Han, however, are far from homogeneous and speak a wide variety of mutually unintelligible local \"dialects\"; which most linguists actually classify as different languages using more or less the same set of Chinese characters. Many of the minority ethnic groups have their own languages as well. Contrary to popular belief, there is no single unified Han Chinese culture, and while they share certain common elements such as Confucian and Taoist beliefs, the regional variations in culture among the Han ethnic group are actually very diverse. Many customs and deities are specific to individual regions and even villages. Celebrations for the lunar new year and other national festivals vary drastically from region to region. Specific customs related to the celebration of important occasions such as weddings, funerals and births also vary widely. In general contemporary urban Chinese society is rather secular and traditional culture is more of an underlying current in every day life. Among ethnic minorities, the Zhuang, Manchu, Hui and Miao are the largest in size. Other notable ethnic minorities include: Koreans, Tibetans, Mongols, Uighurs, Kirghiz and even Russians. In fact, China is home to the largest Korean population outside Korea and is also home to more ethnic Mongols than the Republic of Mongolia itself. Many minorities have been assimilated to various degrees with the loss of language and customs or a fusing with Han traditions. An exception to this trend is the current situation of the Tibetans and Uighurs in China who remain fiercely defensive of their cultures. \n</p><p>Some behaviors that are quite normal in China may be somewhat jarring and vulgar for foreigners:\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:122px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:China_no_spitting.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/1/18/China_no_spitting.jpg/120px-China_no_spitting.jpg\" width=\"120\" height=\"194\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/1/18/China_no_spitting.jpg/180px-China_no_spitting.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/1/18/China_no_spitting.jpg/240px-China_no_spitting.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"400\" data-file-height=\"648\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:China_no_spitting.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>No spitting please</div></div></div>\n<ul><li> Spitting: in the street, shops, supermarkets, hotel lobbies, hallways, restaurants, on buses and even in hospitals. Traditional Chinese medical thought believes it is unhealthy to swallow phlegm. Spitting has declined considerably in more developed urban areas like Beijing and Shanghai since the SARS epidemic of 2002. However, in rural areas the habit persists to varying degrees, from moderate to ever-present.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Smoking: almost anywhere, including areas with \"no smoking signs\" including health clubs, football pitches and even hospitals. Few restaurants have no smoking areas although Beijing now forbids smoking in most restaurants. Enforcement of smoking bans can vary but with the exception of Hong Kong, they most likely will not be. Lower class establishments often do not even have ashtrays. Western restaurants seem to be the only ones who consistently enforce the ban. On locals buses, trains, and subways, however, smoking is often strictly prohibited and consistently enforced. Masks would be good idea for long distance bus trips. It is perfectly common for someone to smoke in a lift, restroom, in a massage parlor, even in the hospital. If your country of origin has banned smoking in most public places, then this aspect of China may be shocking.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Anyone who does not look Chinese will find that calls of \"hello\" or \"laowai\" are common: <i>l\u01ceow\u00e0i</i> (\u8001\u5916) literally means \"old outsider\", a colloquial term for \"foreigner\"; the more formal term is <i>w\u00e0igu\u00f3r\u00e9n</i> (\u5916\u56fd\u4eba). Calls of \"laowai\" are ubiquitous outside of the big cities (and even there, occasionally); these calls will come from just about anyone, of any age, and are even more likely from the very young and can occur many times in any given day. Young children might also come up to you and try to speak English, as they rarely get a chance to practice with a native speaker. Dark skin discrimination is quite a common issue to deal with in China, and light skin is culturally favored. Many young people, especially girls, apply cosmetics to make their skin look lighter. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Staring: This is common through most of the country. The staring usually originates out of sheer curiosity, almost never out of hostility. Don't be surprised if someone comes right up to you and just looks as if they are watching the TV, no harm done! </li></ul>\n<ul><li>Drinking: It is quite common for older members to toast younger members when eating. It is considered extremely disrespectful to turn down the toast, even in good faith. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Loud conversations, noise, discussions or public arguments: These are very common. Many mainland Chinese speak very loudly in public (including in the early mornings) and it may be one of the first things you notice upon arrival. Loud speech usually does not mean that the speaker is angry or engaged in an argument (although obviously it can). Full-blown fights involving physical violence are not very common, but they do occur. If you witness such an event, leave the vicinity and do not get involved. Foreigners are almost never targets in China and you will either be treated with respect or just ignored provided you don't act recklessly. The majority of violence or disrespect directed towards foreigners comes in the form of passive aggressive comments or in being grossly overcharged for pretty much everything. Noise means life, and China is rooted in a community based culture, so you may want to bring earplugs for long bus or train rides!</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Table manners: In China, table etiquettes are quite different compared to western countries. The following behaviors are perfectly acceptable: lifting the bowl.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Pushing, shoving and/or jumping queues: This often occurs anywhere where there are queues, (or lack thereof) particularly at train stations. Again, often there simply are no queues at all. Therefore, queue jumping is a major problem in China. Best bet is to pick a line that looks like its moving or just wait for everyone to get on or off the bus or train first but you may be left behind! Situations have been improving in subway stations, where there're usually staff members to keep people in line. Keep in mind that the concept of personal space more or less does not exist in China. It is perfectly common and acceptable behaviour for someone to come in very close contact with you or to bump into you and say nothing, especially during rush hours when buses, trains, and subways are usually packed. Don't get mad as they will be surprised and most likely won't even understand why you are offended!</li></ul>\n<ul><li> General disregard of city, provincial and/or national rules, regulations and laws. This includes (among many other things) dangerous and negligent driving, (see <a href=\"/en/Driving_in_China\" title=\"Driving in China\">Driving in China</a>) that includes excessive speeding, not using head lights at night, lack of use of turn signals, and driving on the wrong side of the street, jaywalking, and smoking in non-smoking areas or defiance of smoking bans.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Sanitation: Many Chinese do not cover their mouths when they sneeze. Also, it is not uncommon for small children (2-4 years old) to eliminate their waste in public (in bushes, on public sidewalks, even in train stations). Eliminating waste in public, however, is becoming extremely rare in major cities and is frowned upon by the local population.</li></ul>\n<p>Some long-time foreign residents say such behaviours are getting worse; others say the opposite. The cause is usually attributed to the influx of millions of migrants from the countryside who are unfamiliar with big city life. Some department stores place attendants at the foot of each escalator to keep folks from stopping to have a look-see as soon as they get off - when the escalator behind them is fully packed. The above-mentioned situations have nonetheless been improving overall in recent years, especially in major cities as they modernize and welcome more international travelers. \n</p><p>On the whole, however, the Chinese love a good laugh and because there are so many ethnic groups and outsiders from other regions, they are used to different ways of doing things and are quite okay with that (in tier one and tier two cities at least). Indeed the Chinese often make conversation with strangers by discussing differences in accent or dialect. They are very used to sign language and quick to see a non-verbal joke or pun wherever they can spot one. Note that a laugh doesn't necessarily mean scorn, just amusement. The Chinese like a \"collective good laugh\" often at times or circumstances that westerners might consider rude. Finally, the Chinese love and adore children, allow them a great deal of freedom, and heap attention upon them. If you have children, bring them!\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Lucky_Numbers\">Lucky Numbers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Lucky Numbers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In general, 3, 6, 8, and 9 are lucky numbers for most of the Chinese. \u201cThree\u201d means \u201chigh above shine the three stars\u201d while the three stars include gods of fortune, prosperity and longevity. \u201cSix\u201d represents smoothness or success. Many young people choose the dates with \u201csix\u201d as their wedding days, such as the 6th, 16th and 26th. \u201cEight\u201d sounds so close to the word for wealth that many people believe eight is a number that is linked to prosperity. So it is no surprise that the opening ceremony for the Olympics started at 8:08:08 on 08/08/2008. \u201cNine\u201d is also regarded as a lucky number with the meaning of everlasting. \n</p><p>\u201cFour\u201d is a taboo for most Chinese because the pronunciation in Mandarin is close to \u201cdeath\u201d. Some hotels will have their floor numbers go straight from three to five much like some American hotels have their floor numbers go from twelve to fourteen, skipping the \"unlucky\" number 13.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Climate_and_Terrain\">Climate and Terrain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Climate and Terrain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Given the country's size the climate is extremely diverse, from tropical regions in the south to subarctic in the north. <a href=\"/en/Hainan\" title=\"Hainan\">Hainan</a> Island is roughly at the same latitude as Jamaica, while <a href=\"/en/Harbin\" title=\"Harbin\">Harbin</a>, one of the largest cities in the north, is at roughly the latitude of Montreal and has the climate to match. North China has four distinct seasons with intensely hot summers and bitterly cold winters. Southern China tends to be milder and wetter. The further north and west you travel, the drier the climate. Once you leave eastern China and enter the majestic Tibetan highlands or the vast steppes and deserts of Gansu and Xinjiang, distances are vast and the land is very harsh.\n</p><p>Back in the days of the planned economy, the rules stated that buildings in areas north of the Yangtze River got heat in the winter, but anything south of it did not &#8212; this meant unheated buildings in places like Shanghai and Nanjing, which routinely see temperatures below freezing in winter. The rule has long since been relaxed, but the effects are still visible. In general, Chinese use less heating, less building insulation, and wear more warm clothing than Westerners in comparable climates. In a schools or apartments and office buildings, even if the rooms are heated, the corridors are not. Double glazing is quite rare. Students wear winter jackets in class, along with their teachers and long underwear is very common. Air conditioning is increasingly common but is similarly not used in corridors and is often used with the windows and doors open.\n</p><p>There is a wide range of terrain to be found in China with many inland mountain ranges, high plateaus, and deserts in center and the far west. Plains, deltas, and hills dominate the east. The <a href=\"/en/Pearl_River_Delta\" title=\"Pearl River Delta\">Pearl River Delta</a> region around Guangzhou and Hong Kong and the <a href=\"/en/Along_the_Yangtze_river\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Along the Yangtze river\">Yangtze delta</a> around Shanghai are major global economic powerhouses, as is the North China plain around Beijing and the Yellow River.

During holidays, however, hundreds of millions of migrant workers return home and millions of other Chinese travel within the country (but many in the service sector stay behind, enjoying extra pay). Travelers may want to seriously consider scheduling to avoid being on the road, on the rails, or in the air during the major holidays. At the very least, travel should be planned well well in advance. Every mode of <b>transport is extremely crowded</b>; tickets of any kind are hard to come by, and will cost you a lot more, so it may be necessary to book well in advance (especially for those travelling from remote western China to the east coast or in the opposite direction). Train and bus tickets are usually quite easy to buy in China, (during the non-holiday season), but difficulties arising from crowded conditions at these times <i>cannot be overstated</i>. Travellers who are stranded at these times, unable to buy tickets, can sometimes manage to get air tickets, which tend to sell out more slowly because of the higher but still affordable (by western standards) prices. For the most comfortable mode of transportation, air travel is the obvious choice. There is an emerging ultra-modern bullet train network which is also very nice, but you may still have to potentially deal with many insanely overcrowded, smoke-filled, cold, loud and disorganized train depots to get on-board. The spring festival (Chinese New Year) is the largest annual migration of people on earth.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Lunar New Year dates</b><br />\nThe year of the <i><b>Horse</b></i> started on 31 Jan 2014\n</p>\n<ul><li>The year of the <i>Goat</i> will begin on 19 Feb 2015</li>\n<li>The year of the <i>Monkey</i> will begin on 8 Feb 2016</li>\n<li>The year of the <i>Rooster</i> will begin on 28 Jan 2017</li></ul>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>China has five major annual holidays:\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>Chinese New Year</b> or Spring Festival (\u6625\u8282 ch\u016bnji\u00e9) - late January/mid-February</li>\n<li> <b>Qingming Festival</b> \u2014 usually 4\u20136 Apr, or the tomb sweeping day, cemeteries are crowded with people who go to sweep the tombs of their ancestors and offer sacrifices.

For National Day, a week is typical.\n</p><p>The <b>Chinese New Year</b> is especially busy. Not only is it the longest holiday, it is also a traditional time to visit family. The entire country is pretty much shut down during the period. More or less all the migrant workers who have left their farms and villages for better pay in the cities go home. This is often the only chance they have. Everyone wants to go home, and China has a lot of \"everyone\"! Around the Chinese New Year, many stores and other businesses will close for several days, a week, or even longer, so unless you have close friends or relatives in China, it is not ideal to visit during this period.\n</p><p>Also, during early July university students (twenty-odd million of them!) go home and in late August they return to school, jamming transportation options especially between the east coast and the western regions of Sichuan, Gansu, Tibet, and Xinjiang.\n</p><p>A complete list of Chinese festivals would be very long since many areas or ethnic groups have their own local ones. See listings for individual towns for details. Here is a list of some of the nationally important festivals not mentioned above:\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>Lantern Festival</b> (\u5143\u5bb5\u8282 yu\u00e1nxi\u0101oji\u00e9 or \u4e0a\u5143\u8282 sh\u00e0ngyu\u00e1nji\u00e9) - 15th day of the 1st lunar month, just after Chinese New Year, usually in February or March. In some cities, such as Quanzhou, this is a big festival with elaborate lanterns all over town.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Double Seventh Festival</b> (\u4e03\u5915 q\u012bx\u012b) - 7th day of the 7th lunar month, usually August, is a festival of romance, sort of a Chinese Valentine's Day.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Double Ninth Festival</b> or Chongyang Festival (\u91cd\u9633\u8282 ch\u00f3ngy\u00e1ngji\u00e9) - 9th day of the 9th lunar month, usually in October.

Around Christmas, one hears carols &#8212; mostly English, a few in Latin, plus Chinese versions of \"Jingle Bells\", \"Amazing Grace\", and for some reason \"Oh Susana\". Some stores are decorated and one sees many shop assistants in red and white elf hats. For Valentine's Day, many restaurants offer special meals.

At the end of the civil war in 1949, the Communists held most of China and the defeated Nationalists held only Taiwan and a few islands off the Fujian coast. That situation continues to this day; Taiwan has had a separate government for more than 60 years and as such, is governed \"de-facto\" independently. However, most world bodies do not recognize it as a sovereign state - amongst other factors, this may be attributed to the strong influence of the PRC government in this matter. Both governments in theory support eventual reunification of these \"two Chinas\", but there is also a significant pro-independence movement within Taiwan.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table></div>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cities\">Cities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Cities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Forbidden_city.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/upload/en/thumb/0/01/Forbidden_city.jpg/300px-Forbidden_city.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/upload/en/thumb/0/01/Forbidden_city.jpg/450px-Forbidden_city.jpg 1.5x, /upload/en/thumb/0/01/Forbidden_city.jpg/600px-Forbidden_city.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"640\" data-file-height=\"480\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Forbidden_city.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The entrance to the Forbidden City, <a href=\"/en/Beijing\" title=\"Beijing\">Beijing</a></div></div></div>\n<p>China has many large and famous cities.

In most cases, this should be obtained from a Chinese embassy or consulate before departure. Visas for Hong Kong and Macau can be obtained through a Chinese embassy or consulate, but must be applied for separately from the mainland Chinese visa. However, citizens from most Western countries do not need visas to visit <a href=\"/en/Hong_Kong\" title=\"Hong Kong\">Hong Kong</a> and <a href=\"/en/Macau\" title=\"Macau\">Macau</a>. Visitors from most western countries can stay in Hong Kong with free visa for 7 to 90 days. The time duration should depend on which country you are from. However, people from Afghanistan, Albania, Armenia, Bangladesh, Belarus, Burundi, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cuba and Ethiopia need to apply for a visa for Hong Kong before they travel. \n</p><p>The most notable exception to this rule is transit through certain airports. Most airports allow a 12- to 24-hour stay without a visa so long as you do do not pass through immigration and customs (stay airside) and are en-route to a different country. \n</p><p>To visit mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau residents of Chinese nationality need to apply at the China Travel Service, the sole authorized issuing agent, to obtain a Home Return Permit (\u56de\u4e61\u8bc1), a credit card sized ID allowing multiple entries and unlimited stay for 10 years with no restrictions including on employment. Taiwan residents may obtain an entry permit (valid for 3 months) at airports in Dalian, Fuhzou, Haikou, Qingdao, Sanya, Shanghai, Wuhan, Xiamen and China Travel Services in Hong Kong and Macau. Visitors must hold a Republic of China passport, Taiwanese Identity Card and Taiwan Compatriot Pass (\u53f0\u80de\u8bc1 t\u00e1ib\u0101ozh\u00e8ng). The Compatriot Pass may be obtained for single use at airports in Fuzhou, Haikou, Qingdao, Sanya, Wuhan and Xiamen. The entry permit fee is \u00a5100 plus \u00a550 for issuing a single-use Taiwan Compatriot Pass. Travellers should check the most up-to-date information before traveling.\n</p>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Visa overview</b><br />\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>C visa</b> - international flight crews</li>\n<li> <b>D visa</b> - permanent residents</li>\n<li> <b>F visa</b> - business trips, exchanges, and study trips</li>\n<li> <b>G visa</b> - transit</li>\n<li> <b>J visa</b> - journalists, incl.

The usual tourist single-entry visa is valid for a visit of 30 days and must be used within three months of the date of issue. A double-entry tourist visa must be used within six months of the date of issue. It is possible to secure a tourist visa for up to 90 days for citizens of some countries.\n</p><p>Tourist visa extensions can be applied for at the local Entry &amp; Exit Bureaus against handing in the following documents: valid passport, visa extension application form including one 2-inch-sized picture, a copy of the Registration Form of Temporary Residence which you receive from the local police station at registration. \n</p><p>Some travellers will need a dual entry or multiple entry visa. For example, if you enter China on a single entry visa, then depart the mainland to Hong Kong or Macau, you need a new visa to re-enter the mainland. In Hong Kong, multiple entry visas are officially available only to HKID holders, but the authorities are willing to bend the rules somewhat and may approve three-month multiple entry visas for short-term Hong Kong qualified residents, including exchange students. It is recommended to apply directly with the Chinese government in this case, as some agents will be unwilling to submit such an application on your behalf.\nFor holders of multiple entry visas to renew your visa you must leave China. The easist way was to go to Hong Kong, Seoul or some other country, cross the border and re-enter China. A new way is to go to Xiamen and cross to Jinmen island. Jinmen is held by Taiwan and like Hong Kong is offically considered leaving China. See details of below on boats to China.\n</p><p>There may be restrictions on visas for political reasons and these vary over time. For example:\n</p>\n<ul><li> The visa fee for American nationals was increased to US$140 (or US$110 as part of a group tour) in reciprocation for increased fees for Chinese nationals visiting America. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/hzqz/t334452.htm\">[8]</a></li></ul>\n<ul><li> Visas issued in Hong Kong are generally limited to 30 days, same day service is difficult to get. Multiple-entry visas have also become much harder or impossible to get.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Indian nationals are limited to 10- or 15-day tourist visas, and are required to show US$100 per day of visa validity in the form of traveller's checks (US $1,000 and $1,500, respectively).</li></ul>\n<p>A few years ago, the Z (working) visa was a long-term visa. Now a Z-visa only gets you into the country for 30 days; once you are there, the employer gets you a residence permit. This is effectively a multiple-entry visa; you can leave China and return using it. Some local visa offices will refuse to issue a residence permit if you entered China on a tourist (L) visa. In those cases, you have to enter on a Z-visa. These are only issued outside China, so obtaining one will likely require a departure from the mainland, for example to a neighbouring country. (Note that in Korea, tourists not holding an alien registration card must now travel to Busan, as the Chinese consulate in Seoul does not issue visas to non-residents in Korea.) They also usually require an invitation letter from the employer. In other cases it is possible to convert an L visa to a residence permit; it depends upon which office you are dealing with and perhaps on your employer's connections.\n</p><p>It is possible for most foreigners to get a visa in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  \n<span class='vcard' ><a class=\"url external autonumber\" href=\"http://mn.china-embassy.org/eng/lsfw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">[1]</a>. </span>.

Foreigners are also not permitted to travel by public buses across Tibet and are only allowed to travel by private transportation as organised in the tour. Moreover, if entering Tibet from Nepal, one must also joined a group tour and be only allowed on a group visa. The Tibet Travel Permit has to be handed in to the tour guide upon arrival in the airport or train station, and to tour guide will keep the permit until the traveler left the TAR.

Tourists are currently able to use the Tumen/Namyang and Quanhe/Wonjong crossings across the Tumen River between China and North Korea. Ensure both your Chinese and North Korean visas are in order before attempting this.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hong_Kong\">Hong Kong</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39\" title=\"Edit section: Hong Kong\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are four road border crossings into the mainland from Hong Kong at <b>Lok Ma Chau</b>, <b>Sha Tau Kok</b>, <b>Man Kam To</b> and the <b>Shenzhen Bay Bridge</b>.

China has many domestic flights connecting all the major cities and tourist destinations. Airlines include the three international carriers: Air China, China Southern, and China Eastern, as well as regional ones including Hainan Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Sichuan Airlines and Shanghai Airlines.  In recent years, it has been popular for large cities and provinces to open their own (dubiously funded) airline.  These include Chongqing Airlines, Chengdu Airline and Hebei Airlines, amongst others.  The parent company behind Hainan Airlines has spawned some 13 airlines in the region, including Grand China Air, Yangtse Express, Hong Kong Airlines and Deer Jet.\n</p><p>Flights between Hong Kong or Macau and mainland cities are considered to be international flights and so can be quite expensive. Hence if arriving in, or departing from, Hong Kong or Macau, it is usually <b>much</b> cheaper to fly to or from Shenzhen or Zhuhai, just across the border, or Guangzhou, which is a little further afield but offers flights to more destinations. As an example, the distance from Fuzhou to Hong Kong, Shenzhen or Guangzhou is about the same, but as of mid-2005 flying to Hong Kong cost \u00a51400 while list price for the other cities was \u00a5880 and for Shenzhen discounts to \u00a5550 were available. Overnight bus to any of these destinations was about \u00a5250.\n</p><p>Prices for domestic flights are set at standard rates, but discounts are common, especially on the busier routes. Most good hotels, and many hostels, will have a travel ticket service and may be able to save you 15%-70% off the price of tickets. Travel agencies and booking offices are plentiful in all Chinese cities and offer similar discounts. Even before considering discounts, traveling by plane in China is not expensive. \n</p><p>For travel within China, it is usually best to buy tickets in China via a high street travel agent, or on Chinese websites.  Most domestic flights when bought abroad (e.g. on Expedia or even via an Air China office) will be much more expensive, as only full fare tickets are sold.  Discounted tickets are only sold within China, or as a tag on fare on an international ticket.  Schedules for domestic flights are generally not finalised or released until around 2-3 months before a flight.  Unlike most air markets, early buyers will pay higher rates, as discounts tend to increase with time.  For most flights, the optimum purchase period is between 2-4 weeks before a flight.  On emptier flights, it can be easy to get a very discounted rate in the days before the flight.  Once you know your intended route, it\u2019s advisable to monitor the fares to see when they rise and fall (which they will almost definitely do).  However, when travelling during a busy period (e.g. Chinese New Year), it\u2019s wise to buy earlier to guarantee yourself a seat.  Some more expensive tickets are flexible, allowing you to cancel for a nominal amount (between 5%-20%), then rebook at a lower fare.  Recently, discounts have been made available in premium cabins on domestic flights.  On some routes, the buy-up from economy is very minimal, and is worth it for the extra space.  Beware, however, than often perks of the ground (e.g. lounge, extra luggage, points) are not included on the discount rates.\n</p><p>Be prepared for unexplained flight delays as these are common despite pressure from both the government and consumers. For short distances, consider other, seemingly slower options. Flight cancellations are also not uncommon. If you buy your ticket from a Chinese vendor they will likely try to contact you (if you left contact information) to let you know about the change in flight plan. If you purchased your ticket overseas, be certain to check on the flight status a day or two before you plan to fly.  Chinese airlines are generally quick to offer meals when a particular flight has been delayed, although the meals/snacks might not be suited to Western tastes.  It\u2019s always advisable to travel with emergency rations in China.  water cannot be brought through security, but all Chinese airports have hot water machines, so bring a plastic mug and some tea bags.\n</p><p>As everywhere in the world, prices for food and drink at Chinese airports are vastly inflated. Coffee that is \u00a525 in a downtown shop is \u00a578 at the same chain's airport branches. KFC seems to be the one exception; their many airport shops charge the same prices as other branches. Paying \u00a520 or more for a KFC meal may or may not be worthwhile when there are \u00a55 noodles across the street, but at the airports it is usually the best deal around.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_train_2\">By train</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=51\" title=\"Edit section: By train\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Shanghai_Maglev_Train.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/38/Shanghai_Maglev_Train.jpg/200px-Shanghai_Maglev_Train.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/38/Shanghai_Maglev_Train.jpg/300px-Shanghai_Maglev_Train.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/38/Shanghai_Maglev_Train.jpg/400px-Shanghai_Maglev_Train.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1024\" data-file-height=\"768\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Shanghai_Maglev_Train.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Maglev train in <a href=\"/en/Shanghai\" title=\"Shanghai\">Shanghai</a></div></div></div>\n<p>Train travel is the major mode of long-distance transportation for the Chinese themselves. Their extensive, and rapidly expanding, network of routes covers the entire country. Roughly a quarter of the world's total rail traffic is in China.\n</p><p>China is in the process of building a network of high-speed trains, similar to French TGV or Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains. These trains are already in service on several routes. They are called <b>CRH</b> and train numbers have a \"G\", \"C\" or \"D\" prefix.

The soft sleeper compartments contain four bunks stacked two to a column (though some newer trains have two-bunk compartments), a latchable door for privacy, and are quite spacious. Try to get the lower bunk as climbing up to upper bunk is not that easy, also if you can sit on th bed and look out the window if you don't want to sleep.</li>\n<li>  note: Ticker holder of this class can go to the VIP waiting room at station.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Hard sleepers</b> (\u786c\u5367 <i>y\u00ecngw\u00f2</i>), on the other hand, have 3 beds per column open to the corridor. The highest bunk is very high up and leaves little space for headroom. Taller travelers (6'3\" and above) may find this to be the best bunk since when sleeping your feet will extend into the passageway and they will not be bumped. The top bunk is also useful for people with things to hide (e.g. cameras). When placed by your head they are harder for would-be thieves to reach. It should be noted that the \"hard\" sleeper is not \"hard\"; the beds have a mattress and are generally quite comfortable. All sleepers have pillows and a blanket.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Soft seats</b> (\u8f6f\u5ea7 <i>ru\u01cenzu\u00f2</i>) are cloth-covered, generally reclining seats and are a special category that you will rarely find. These are only available on day trains between destinations of about 4-8 hours of travel time, as well as on all high speed trains (class D and above).</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Hard seats</b> (\u786c\u5ea7 <i>y\u00ecngzu\u00f2</i>), which are actually padded, are not for everyone, especially overnight, as they are 5 seats wide, in a three and two arrangement. It is in this class, however, that most of the backpacker crowd travels. Despite the \"no smoking\" signs, there almost always remain smokers within the car. There is invariably a crowd of smokers at the ends of the cars and the smoke will drift endlessly into the cabin. On most trains, particularly in China's interior, the space between the cars is a designated smoking area although the signs for \"designated smoking area\" are only in Chinese so this fact may not be clear to many travelers. Overnight travel in the hard seats can safely be deemed uncomfortable for just about everyone and will cause a great deal of discomfort for nearly including many restless endless hours of no sleep. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Standing</b> (\u65e0\u5ea7 <i>w\u00fazu\u00f2</i>) allow access to the hard seat car but give no seat reservation. Consider carrying a tripod chair in your backpack to make such journeys more comfortable. </li></ul>\n<p>The soft seat and soft sleeper cars, and some of hard seat and hard sleeper cars are air-conditioned.\n</p><p>The CRH trains have usually five classes - <b>second class</b> (3+2 seat layout), <b>first class</b> (2+2 layout) and three <b>VIP class</b>es (2+1 layout just behind the driver's cabin). There are three different VIP classes, named \"\u5546\u52a1\u5ea7\" (business class), \"\u89c2\u5149\u5ea7\" (sightseeing class) and \"\u7279\u7b49\u5ea7\" (deluxe class). Unlike on airliners, \u5546\u52a1\u5ea7 (business class) is in fact better than \"\u4e00\u7b49\u5ea7\" (first class) on CRH trains. \u5546\u52a1\u5ea7 (business class) and \u89c2\u5149\u5ea7 (sightseeing class) priced the same, while \u7279\u7b49\u5ea7 is usually more expensive than \"\u4e00\u7b49\u5ea7\" (first class), but cheaper than \u5546\u52a1\u5ea7 and \u89c2\u5149\u5ea7. The second class is equivalent to economy class on airplanes but offers much more comfortable seat and huge legroom. On the other hand, the premium classes cost only a little more and offers luxury rides.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Train_tickets\">Train tickets</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=54\" title=\"Edit section: Train tickets\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Chinese_train_ticket.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/a/aa/Chinese_train_ticket.jpg/220px-Chinese_train_ticket.jpg\" width=\"220\" height=\"129\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/a/aa/Chinese_train_ticket.jpg/330px-Chinese_train_ticket.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/a/aa/Chinese_train_ticket.jpg/440px-Chinese_train_ticket.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"710\" data-file-height=\"417\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Chinese_train_ticket.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Chinese train ticket with fields description</div></div></div>\n<p>At the point where a given train starts, train tickets can usually be bought up to seven days in advance. After the point where a given train starts, a small number of tickets might be reserved for purchase in larger towns along the route of travel. Usually these are the \"standing\" class. If you want to get a seat assignment (zuowei) or a sleeper (wopu), then find the train conductor and he will tell you if there is availability. The biggest demand is for hard seats and hard sleepers, so it' is a good idea to ask a local friend to buy hard seat tickets as the sellers are not always willing to sell them to foreigners although this is rapidly changing. As of January 2012, nationals and foreigners alike must <b>present ID</b> in order to purchase a ticket (e.g., national ID card or passport). The purchaser's name is printed onto the ticket and each individual is required to be present, with ID, to pick-up their ticket.\n</p><p>There are local state railway ticket agencies in many locations remote from train stations, clearly marked \"Booking Office for Train Tickets\" in English and Chinese and a locomotive emblem, but easily overlooked as these are simple \"hole in the wall\" shops. They are equipped with computers networked with the central booking system. Tickets purchased at these types of locations can be bought up to 10 days in advance at face value prices which can be half of what commercial travel agencies charge. Staff usually does not speak English. An easy fix is finding someone who looks like a college student and he will be usually very willing to help.\n</p><p>Do not expect English-speaking staff at station cash desks either, even in big cities. And if the cashier finds some English-speaking colleague, don't expect that he can work with the reservation system. If you don't speak Mandarin, write the departure and destination station, date and time of departure, train number and required class on paper. You can write the station name in pinyin, as the cashier enters them in the same way to the reservation system. Beware that many cities have different stations for normal trains and high-speed trains. High-speed station names usually consist of city name and cardinal direction (for example <i>H\u00e9ngy\u00e1ngd\u014dng</i> \"Hengyang East\")\n</p><p>During busy seasons (Chinese New Year, for example) tickets sell out rapidly at train stations. It may be better to get tickets in advance through an agent. In major cities there are also agents who sell tickets in the normal time frame with a nominal markup. The convenience of avoiding a trip to the train station and waiting in the queue is well worth the small increase in cost. Travel agencies will accept money and bookings for tickets in advance but no one can guarantee your ticket until the station releases them onto the market, at which point your agency will go and buy the ticket they had previously \"guaranteed\" you. This is true anywhere in China.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Travel_tips\">Travel tips</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=55\" title=\"Edit section: Travel tips\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The toilets on trains tend to be cleaner than on buses or most public areas because they are simple devices that empty the contents directly onto the ground near tracks and thus don't smell as bad. Soft sleeper cars usually have European throne-style toilets at one end of the car and Chinese squat toilets at the other. Be aware that on non-CRH trains if the train will be stopping at a station, the conductor will normally lock the bathrooms prior to arrival so that people will not leave deposits on the ground at the station. CRH (G, C, D) trains are newly built and are equipped with modern vacuum toilets, therefore don't have the problem.\n</p><p>Long distance trains will have a buffet or dining car, which serves hot, but generally overpriced, at \u00a525 or so and frankly not very tasty, food. The menu will be entirely in Chinese, but if you're willing to take the chance, interpret some of the Chinese characters, or ask for common dishes by name, you can eat very well. If you are on a strict budget, wait until the train stops at a station. There are normally vendors on the platform who sell noodles, snacks, and fruit at better prices. Trains generally have boiled water available so bring tea, soups and instant noodles to make your own food.\n</p><p>Be careful with your valuables while on the train; property theft on public transportation has gone up in recent years.\n</p><p>On most higher-level trains (T, K, Z and CRH trains) pre-recorded announcements are made in Chinese, English and occasionally Cantonese (if the train serves Guangdong province or Hong Kong), Mongolian (in Inner Mongolia), Tibetan (in Tibet) or Uyghur (in Xinjiang). On local trains there are no English announcements so knowing when to get off can be harder.\n</p><p>Motion sickness pills are recommended if you are inclined toward that type of ailment. Ear plugs are recommended to facilitate uninterrupted sleep. In sleeper cars, tickets are exchanged for cards on long distance trains. The cabin attendants return the original tickets when the train approaches the destination station thus ensuring everyone gets off where they should even if they can't wake themselves up.\n</p><p>If you have some things to share on the train, you'll have fun. The Chinese families and business people traveling the route are just as bored as the next person and will be happy to attempt conversation or share a movie shown on a laptop. All in all, the opportunity to see the countryside going by is a neat experience.\n</p><p>You'll need your ticket to enter and exit the station - usually there will be an inspection at the departure hall entrance or the boarding gate and another at the exit gate. Once in the departure hall, follow the digital indicator boards to find the right boarding gate (they are in Chinese but will display the train service number which is printed at the top of your ticket). Approx 10 minutes before boarding your train and platform will be announced and the gate will be opened, just follow the crowd to the platform - at larger stations the train will already be waiting, in smaller stations look for your car number written on the platform edge - make sure you're waiting in the right place because often the train will only stop for a couple of minutes. Some newer stations have high-level platforms that are level with the door, but at smaller stations the platforms are very low and you have to ascend several steep steps to board the train so be prepared if you have a large suitcase. Generally passengers are friendly and will offer to help you with bulky luggage.\n</p><p>Smoking is not permitted in the seating or sleeping areas but is allowed in the vestibules at the end of each car. On the new CRH trains, the Guangzhou-Kowloon shuttle train and the Beijing Suburban Railway smoking is completely forbidden. Smoking is banned inside station buildings apart from in designated smoking rooms, although these places are often unpleasant and poorly ventilated.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Useful_websites\">Useful websites</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=56\" title=\"Edit section: Useful websites\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li>CTrains <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ctrains.com\">[37]</a> is the first China train ticket online booking website for English users.

However, if you can understand the bus routes then they are cheap and go almost everywhere. Buses will normally have recorded announcements telling you the next stop - examples of which might include 'xia yi zhan - zhong shan lu' (next stop Zhongshan Road) or 'Shanghai nan huo che zhan dao le' (Shanghai South railway station - now arriving). Some major cities such as Beijing or Hangzhou will have English announcements on some major routes. Fares are usually about 1 or 2 yuan (the former for older buses with no air-conditioning, the latter for air-conditioned modern buses) or more if travelling into the suburbs. Most buses simply have a metal cash-box next to the entrance where you can insert your fare (no change - save up those 1 yuan coins and notes) or on longer routes a conductor that will collect fares and issue tickets and change. Note that the driver usually prioritises speed over comfort so hold on tight.\n</p>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Sleeper buses</b><br />\nSleeper buses are common in China; instead of seats they have bunk beds. These are a good way to cover longer distances &#8212; overnight at freeway speeds is 100 km or more &#8212; but they are not all that comfortable for large or tall travelers.\n</p><p>Generally, these are fast smooth and comfortable in the prosperous coastal provinces and less so in less developed areas. Try to avoid getting the bunk at the very back of the bus; if the bus hits a major bump, passengers there become airborne. \n</p><p>At some places you have to remove your shoes as you enter the bus; a plastic bag is provided to store them. Follow the locals. If there are food or restroom stops, you put the shoes back on. If you normally travel in boots, it is worth getting a pair of kung fu slippers to make this easy.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p><br />\nCoaches, or <b>long-distance buses</b>, differ drastically and can be a reasonably comfortable or very unpleasant experience. Coaches originating from larger cities on the east coast tend to be air conditioned with soft seats or sleepers. The roads are very good and the ride is smooth, allowing you to enjoy the view or take a snooze. Coaches are often a better, though more expensive option than trains. Bus personnel tend to try to be helpful, but they are much less familiar with foreigners than airline personnel and English ability is very rare. Some coaches have toilets, but they are frequently dirty and using them can be difficult as the bus turns a corner and water in the basin splashes around. \n</p><p>A coach or bus in rural China is a different experience altogether. Signs in the station to identify buses will only be in Chinese or another local language, routes may also be posted or pasted on bus windows and drivers or touts will shout their destinations as you pass, the coach's license plate number is supposed to be printed on the ticket, but all too often that is inaccurate. Due to different manners and customs, foreigners may find bus personnel to be lacking in politeness and other passengers lacking in manners as they spit on the floor and out the window and smoke. The vehicle can get crowded if the driver decides to pick up as many passengers as he can cram into the bus. The roads in rural China are frequently little more than a series of potholes, which makes for a bumpy and painful ride; if you have a seat in the back of the bus you'll spend much of your trip flying through the air. Scheduled times of departure and arrival are only rough estimates, as many buses won't leave until every seat is sold, which can add hours, and breakdowns and other mishaps can significantly extend your trip. The misery of your ride is only compounded if you have to travel for 10 or 20 hours straight. As gut-wrenching as all this sounds, short of shelling out the cash for your own personal transport, rural coaches are the only forms of transportation in many areas of China. On the bright side, such rural coaches are usually more than willing to stop anywhere along the route should you wish to visit more remote areas without direct transport. Buses can also be flagged down at most points along their route. The ticket price the rest of the way is negotiable.\n</p><p>Everywhere in China drivers often disregard the rules of the road, if there are any, and accidents are frequent. Sudden swerves and stops can cause injury, so keep a good hold wherever possible. Horn honking is widespread among Chinese drivers, so a set of earplugs is a good idea if you plan on sleeping during the trip.\n</p><p>Getting a ticket can be fairly hard. Large bus stations have ticket counters who sell printed tickets displaying the departure time, boarding gate and license plate number of your bus (not always accurate) and have fixed prices. Smaller bus stations will have touts shouting destinations and will direct you to your bus where you pay on board. Even large stations have touts outside - generally they will call the bus driver of a departing bus, who will wait up the road while the tout takes you there on the back of a motorcycle to the waiting bus - you can then negotiate the fare with the driver. This is sometimes a complete scam and sometimes you can save around 30% of the fare - depending on your bargaining and Chinese abilities.\n</p><p>There is an alternative now with an Independent Travel Network that has been created by a western company.  Dragon Bus China now operates an Integrated transport and accommodation network across most of China.   The Network is a \u201cJump On &amp; Off\u201d style of travel which means that you can stay longer at any of the Cities that they travel through and be assured that another bus will be coming through that same City for you or you travel partners to board.   This travel option has been operating for more than 25 years throughout Europe and is an extremely popular form of independent travel within New Zealand, Australia and Canada.   Traveling by this method could greatly reduce the hassle of traveling by public buses and greatly increase the safety aspect.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_subway\">By subway</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=58\" title=\"Edit section: By subway\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Major cities &#8212; at least Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Shenyang, Xian, Chengdu and Nanjing &#8212; have a subway (\u5730\u94c1 <i>d\u00ecti\u011b</i>) system. Chongqing has monorail systems. Xiamen has a system of bus-only roads for bus rapid transit, mostly elevated. Generally these are modern, clean, cheap and efficient, and virtually all station signs, train signs, and ticket machines are bilingual in both English and Chinese.  On both station platforms and in trains there is usually fully bilingual signage listing all stations on that particular line. Also, bi-lingual staff members are usually present near the ticket machine or on the platform. Therefore, the subway might be the easiest way for you to travel through the city if you don't speak Chinese.\n</p><p>One major caveat is that the subway network maps posted on the walls in the stations are not always consistently provided in fully bilingual form, or hard copy pamphlets with fully bilingual maps may not always be available in the stations.  If you can't read Chinese, this can be a problem when trying to change lines in a hurry, because you need to know the correct line terminal to board at the correct platform.  You should obtain a bilingual subway network map in advance and carry it with you while traveling by subway. \n</p><p>Subway stations in Chinese cities generally have a security checkpoint before the turnstiles that is always manned when the station is open.  They normally do not have walk-through metal detectors so you won't have to empty your pockets like in an airport.  But these checkpoints do have an X-ray scanner large enough to take all bags up to small carry-ons, and all patrons are expected to run their bags through the scanner. Sometimes the staff will ask water bottles to be removed from bags and conduct additional inspections.\n</p><p>Make sure you have spare changes for the subway. Most of the ticket machines will accept coins and small bills from 5 to 50 yuan. One hundred yuan bills are generally not accepted, nor are credit cards. You can exchange for small bills easily at a staffed ticket counter.\n</p><p>Most of these systems are being expanded, and new lines are under construction (as of early 2009) in other cities such as Hangzhou, Xi'an and Chengdu. The long-term plans are quite ambitious, with multiple subway lines per city planned. By 2020 or so China seems likely to have some of the world's most extensive urban transport infrastructure. Subway systems which link into regional rail systems such as between Guangzhou and Shenzhen are planned in many regions.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_taxi\">By taxi</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=59\" title=\"Edit section: By taxi\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Taxis (\u51fa\u79df\u8f66 <i>ch\u016bz\u016bch\u0113</i> or \u7684\u58eb <i>dish\u00ec</i>, pronounced \"deg-see\" in Cantonese-speaking areas) are generally common, and reasonably priced. Flagfalls range from \u00a55 in some cities to \u00a514 in others, with a per kilometer charge around \u00a52. In most situations, you can expect between \u00a510 and \u00a550 for an ordinary trip within the city. There is no extra charge for luggage, but in many cities rates are a bit higher at night. Tips are not expected.\n</p><p>While it is not unheard of for drivers to cheat visitors by deliberately selecting a longer route, it is not that common, and usually shouldn't be a nuisance. When it does happen, the fare difference will usually be minimal. However, should you feel you have been seriously cheated on the way to your hotel, and you are staying at a mid- or high-range hotel that has a doorman, you can appeal to him and/or the desk staff for assistance: A single sharp sentence pointing out the deception may resolve the issue. \n</p><p>Also beware of taxi hawkers who stalk naive travelers inside or just outside the airport terminals and train stations. They will try to negotiate a set price to bring you to your destination and will usually charge 2x or 3x more than a metered fare. If you\u2019re not familiar with the area then stick with the designated taxi areas that are outside most major airport terminals and insist that the driver use the meter. The fare should be plainly marked outside the taxi. \n</p><p>Finding a taxi during peak hours can be a bit hard. But it really gets tough if it is raining. Away from peak hours, especially at night, it is sometimes possible to get a 10% to 20% discount especially if you negotiate it in advance, even if with the meter on and asking for a receipt. As with everything else in China you should not tip. (It's seen as a form of corruption.)\n</p><p>Sitting in the front passenger seat of taxis is acceptable; some taxis even mount the taxi meter down by the gearbox, where you can only see it from the front seat. Be warned that drivers may start smoking without asking by just opening their window and lighting up. In some cities it is also common for drivers to try and pick up multiple passengers if their destinations are in the same general direction. Each passenger pays full fare but it saves the time of waiting for an empty cab at rush hour.\n</p><p>Even in major cities like Shanghai or Beijing, you are very unlikely to find an English-speaking taxi driver, though Beijing made progress toward this in preparation for the Olympics, and Shanghai has made some progress due to the World Expo. Anywhere else it is basically impossible. If you try say the name of your destination in <a href=\"/en/Chinese_phrasebook\" title=\"Chinese phrasebook\">Mandarin</a> (but with your native pronunciation), you may not be understood. Therefore, it is advisable to keep a written note of the name of place where you want to go to by taxi. Chinese characters are far better for this than a romanized (pinyin) version, as many drivers cannot read pinyin, and the same pinyin may correspond to different characters. Get business cards for your hotel, and for restaurants you like, to show taxi drivers. It will be a good idea to equip yourself with sound tracked guide to conversation in Chinese. Such tools can be easily found on the Internet in different languages.\n</p><p>If you are in China for any length of time, consider getting a cell phone so you can call Chinese friends and let them tell the driver where to take you. Cellphones are inexpensive, and pay-as-you-go GSM SIM cards are readily available.\n</p><p>In some cities, taxi companies use a star-rating system for drivers, ranging from 0 to 5, displayed on the driver's name-plate, on the dashboard in front of the passenger seat. While no or few stars do not necessarily indicate a bad driver, many stars tend to indicate good knowledge of the city, and willingness to take you to where you ask by the shortest way. Another indicator of the driver's ability can be found on the same name-plate - the driver's ID number. A small number tells you he has been around for a long time, and is likely to know the city very well. A quick tip to get a taxi driver's attention if you feel you are being ripped off or cheated: Get out the car and start writing down his license plate number and if you speak some Chinese (or have a good phrasebook) threaten to report the driver to the city or the taxi company. Most drivers are honest and fares are not very high but there are the bad ones out there who will try to use your lack of Chinese skills to their advantage.\n</p><p>Chinese can sometimes be very assertive when it comes to finding a taxi. The person who flags down a particular car is not necessarily entitled to that ride. Having locals move farther up in traffic to intercept cars or being shoved out of the way while trying to enter a taxi is not unheard of. If there are others in the area competing for rides, be ready to reach your car and enter it as soon as possible after flagging it down.\n</p><p>Wear your seat belt at all times (if you can find it) however much the taxi driver insists you don't need it.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_tram_.28trolley.29\">By tram (trolley)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=60\" title=\"Edit section: By tram (trolley)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Above ground, certain cities like Dalian or Changchun, offer transport via tram. Making more frequent stops than light-rail, they may offer a practical way of getting around if the touring city possesses one. Single-cart trolleys may also be in use. Both modes are susceptible to traffic jams.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_bicycle\">By bicycle</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=61\" title=\"Edit section: By bicycle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Bicycles (z\u00ecx\u00edngch\u0113, \u81ea\u884c\u8f66), along with electronic bikes and motorcycle, are the most common form of transportation in China; at rush hour almost anywhere in China there will be thousands of them. Many are traditional heavy single-speed roadsters, but basic multi-geared mountain bikes are pretty common as well. For travelers, bicycles can be a cheap, convenient means of transport that is better than being squeezed into a public bus for hours on end. \n</p><p>There are two major <b>dangers for cyclists</b> in China:\n</p>\n<ul><li> One is the rest of the <b>traffic</b>; cars and motorcycles frequently pull out without any warning, and in some areas red lights are apparently optional. See the more extensive comment at <a href=\"/en/Driving_in_China\" title=\"Driving in China\">Driving in China</a>.</li>\n<li> <b>Bicycle theft is rampant</b> throughout cities in China. Observe how other people park their bikes. In some places you can still see local people causally parking their bikes, but in many cities, people tend to lock it inside restaurants and internet cafes. This is a warning sign. Don't expect your high-grade locks can do much. You're highly advised to park in designated areas with a guard as much as possible; it usually costs around RMB1 to RMB2. Some local people also intentionally buy a second-hand, old, ugly bikes so that they won't tempt a thief. </li></ul>\n<p>In most tourist areas &#8212; whether major cities like <a href=\"/en/Beijing\" title=\"Beijing\">Beijing</a> or heavily-touristed villages such as <a href=\"/en/Yangshuo\" title=\"Yangshuo\">Yangshuo</a> &#8212; bicycles are easy to rent and there is a repair shop around every corner. Guided bike tours are also readily available.\n</p><p>Buying a bicycle is easy. Dahon, Merianda and Giant are three most popular brands in amatuer and semi-professional market and all cities have their distributors. Many supermarkets also carry a good stock of bikes. Prices vary from as little as \u00a5150 to over \u00a510000. For a reasonably well-equipped mountain bike for riding to areas like Tibet, expect around \u00a53000-\u00a54500 for a bike. Big cities like Shanghai and Beijing usually stock more professional upmarket bikes, but if you have very specific requirements, Hong Kong is still the last hope for buying them. \n</p><p>Bicycle repair shops are frequent apparently anywhere in cities and rural areas; Non-Chinese speaking tourists might find it a bit difficult, but you can just look for bikes and tires. For a quick fix to a sudden flat tire, there are also many people standing by along the road with a bowl of water and a repair kit ready. For special parts like disc brake, you may want to bring your spare one if you are not using them in big cities.\n</p><p>China is a vast country and it provides professional bikers with challenges to bike across mountains and desert. However, as of May 2010, if foreign tourists want to bike across Tibetan Plateau, <i>you are required by law to obtain a permit and hire a tour guide</i>. \n</p><p>See <a href=\"/en/Karakoram_Highway\" title=\"Karakoram Highway\">Karakoram Highway</a> for one spectacular but difficult route. Companies such as Bike China and Intrepid Travel organize such tours for small groups.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=62\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>See also:</i> <a href=\"/en/Driving_in_China\" title=\"Driving in China\">Driving in China</a>\n</p><p>The legal driving age in Mainland China is <b>18</b>.\n</p><p>The PRC generally does not recognize International Driving Permits and does not permit foreigners to drive in China without a Chinese license. Note that Hong Kong and Macau licenses are also considered to be foreign and having one of them will not allow you to drive in the mainland. This supposedly changed in 2007 and short-term driving without a Chinese license became legal. However, as with many laws in China, official changes and changes in practice do not necessarily correspond; as of December 2008 it is still illegal for foreigners to drive without a Chinese license. Unless you have diplomatic status, importing foreign vehicles is nearly impossible.\n</p><p>Rented cars most often come with a driver, similar to the <i>remises</i> of South America; this is probably the best way to travel in China by car. Driving yourself around China, even if you can read and speak basic Chinese and are able to qualify for a local license, is <i>not</i> recommended unless you are accustomed to extremely chaotic driving conditions. Driving in China's cities is not for the faint-hearted, and parking spaces are often very difficult to find. That said, driving in China is still easier than driving in Vietnam and other developing countries in Asia. Traffic moves on the right in mainland China. Many neighbors, such as India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan as well as the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau have traffic that moves on the left.\n</p><p>English directional signs are ubiquitous in Beijing, Shanghai and other major cities which see many Western tourists. However, they are spotty at best in other cities and virtually non-existent in the countryside. As such, it is always a good idea to have your destination written in Chinese before you set off so that locals can point you in the right direction should you get lost.\n</p><p>Foreigners should really avoid driving outside of major cities. \"One Way\" signs usually mean \"mostly but not always one way\". Expect someone who misses an exit ramp on a freeway to slow down just before the upcoming entry ramp and make a 270\u00b0 turn to engage on that ramp. Expect drivers to take creative shortcuts at traffic circles. \n</p><p>As a pedestrian ALWAYS look both ways every time you cross any street. Not only may a bicycle come along traveling in the wrong direction, so may increasingly popular electric motorbike -- and they are silent.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_motorcycle\">By motorcycle</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=63\" title=\"Edit section: By motorcycle\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>See also:</i> <a href=\"/en/Driving_in_China#Motorcycles\" title=\"Driving in China\">Driving in China#Motorcycles</a>\n</p><p>Motorcycle taxis are common, especially in smaller cities and rural areas. They are usually cheap and effective but somewhat scary. The fares are negotiable.\n</p><p>Regulations for riding a motorcycle vary from city to city. In some cases, 50cc mopeds can be ridden without a driving license although many cities have now banned them or reclassified them due to numerous accidents. Riding a 'proper' motorcycle is much harder - partly because you'll need a Chinese license, partly because they are banned in many cities and partly because production and importing have slowed with the focus on automobiles and electric scooters. The typical Chinese motorcycle is 125cc, can do about 100km/h and is a traditional cruiser style. They are gnerally slow, mundane to ride and have little sporting potential. Government restrictions on engine size mean that sports bikes are rare but can still be found. Another popular choice is a 125cc automatic 'maxi' scooter based loosely on the Honda CN250 - it's a bit quicker than a moped and more comfortable over long distances but has the benefit of automatic transmission which makes negotiating stop-start urban traffic much easier.\n</p><p>Most cities will have a motorcycle market of some description and will often sell you a cheap motorcycle often with fake or illegal license plates - although a foreigner on a motorbike is a rare sight and it will grab the police's attention. Helmets are essential on 'proper' bikes but optional on scooters. Technically you'll need a license plate - they are yellow or blue on a motorcycle or green on a scooter and can cost several thousand RMB to register the bike yourself although fake plates are easily available at a lower price - do so at your own risk.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_pedicab_.28rickshaw.29\">By pedicab (rickshaw)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=64\" title=\"Edit section: By pedicab (rickshaw)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>What's in a name?</b><br />\nThe terms pedicab and rickshaw are often used interchangeably by foreigners in China, but refer to two different modes of transportation - one of which no longer exists. The (in)famous rickshaw was a two-wheeled contraption with two poles at the front, which the operator held while walking or running passengers to their destinations. These proliferated in the late 19th century but were gradually phased out by the 1950s. Videos of Western elites playing polo on rickshaws propelled by Chinese workers showcased the exploitative nature of rickshaws. A distant relative of the rickshaw can still be seen when day-laborers in smaller or less developed cities gather with their rickshaw-like carts each morning waiting for work delivering construction materials, coal, or other odds and ends. The rickshaw has been replaced by the pedicab - a three-wheeled conveyance ridden much like a bicycle.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p><br />\nIn some mid-sized cities, pedicabs are a much more convenient means of traveling short distances. Sanlunche (\u4e09\u8f6e\u8f66), the Chinese term used both for pedal-powered and motorized rickshaws, are ubiquitous in rural China and lesser developed (which is to say, less touristy) areas of larger cities. Negotiating the fare in advance is a must.\n</p><p>Reports that \"the drivers will frequently try and rip you off\" probably refer to rip-off artists working tourist destinations, like Sanlitun, Silk Street, Wangfujing areas in Beijing in particular. Perhaps the rule of thumb should be, \"Beware of anyone selling anything near tourist traps.\" \n</p><p>If you see normal Chinese families using the \"sanlun\" - for instance, traveling between the Beijing Zoo and the nearest subway stop - then it's safe. Don't patronize any sanlun wearing some old fashioned costume to attract tourists. He'll try to charge you ten times the going rate.\n</p><p>Where possible try to choose pedicabs over motorized transport. You'll be helping the truly poor stay in business and preserving part of China's traditional charm. Electrified 3-whelled sanluns developed or converted from the pedicabs seem to be in the majority in Shanghai.\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Talk\">Talk</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=65\" title=\"Edit section: Talk\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:242px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Sinitic_Languages0.gif\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/6/6a/Sinitic_Languages0.gif/240px-Sinitic_Languages0.gif\" width=\"240\" height=\"504\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/6/6a/Sinitic_Languages0.gif/360px-Sinitic_Languages0.gif 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//6/6a/Sinitic_Languages0.gif 2x\" data-file-width=\"449\" data-file-height=\"942\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Sinitic_Languages0.gif\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Map of Chinese dialects</div></div></div>\n<p>The official language of China is <b><a href=\"/en/Chinese_phrasebook\" title=\"Chinese phrasebook\">Standard Mandarin</a></b>, which is mostly based on the Beijing dialect, known in Chinese as <i>Putonghua</i> (\u666e\u901a\u8bdd, \"common speech\").  Mandarin has been the only language used in education on the mainland since the 1950s, so most people speak it. Unless otherwise noted, all terms, spellings and pronunciations in this guide are in standard Mandarin. As Mandarin is tonal, getting the four tones correct is necessary to be understood.\n</p><p>Many regions, especially in the southeast and south of the country, also have their own \"dialect.\"  These are really different languages, as different as French and Italian, although referring to Chinese dialects as separate languages is a touchy political issue. Like standard Mandarin, the \"dialects\" are all tonal languages. Even within Mandarin (the large brown language area on the map), pronunciation varies widely between regions and there is often a liberal dose of local slang or terminology to liven up the mix. After Mandarin, the largest groups are <b><a href=\"/en/Wu_phrasebook\" title=\"Wu phrasebook\">Wu</a></b>, spoken in the region around Shanghai, Zhejiang and southern <a href=\"/en/Jiangsu\" title=\"Jiangsu\">Jiangsu</a>, followed by <b><a href=\"/en/Cantonese_phrasebook\" title=\"Cantonese phrasebook\">Cantonese</a></b>, spoken in most of Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and Macau, and the <b>Min</b> (Fujian) group which includes <b><a href=\"/en/Minnan_phrasebook\" title=\"Minnan phrasebook\">Minnan</a></b> (Hokkien) spoken in the region around <a href=\"/en/Xiamen\" title=\"Xiamen\">Xiamen</a> and in Taiwan, a variant of Minnan known as Teochew spoken around <a href=\"/en/Shantou\" title=\"Shantou\">Shantou</a> and <a href=\"/en/Chaozhou\" title=\"Chaozhou\">Chaozhou</a>, as well as <b>Mindong</b> (Hokchiu) spoken around <a href=\"/en/Fuzhou\" title=\"Fuzhou\">Fuzhou</a>. Most Chinese are bilingual in their local vernacular and Mandarin.  Some who are older, less educated or from the countryside may speak only the local dialect, but this is unlikely to affect tourists. It often helps to have a guide who can speak the local language as it marks that person as an insider and you as a friend of the insider. While you can easily get by in most parts of China speaking Standard Mandarin, locals always appreciate any attempt to say a few words or phrases in the local dialect, so learning a few simple greetings will help you get acquainted with the locals much more easily. In general, an understanding of or appreciation for the local speech can be useful when traveling to more remote areas. But in those areas a phrase book that includes Chinese characters will still be a big help as written Chinese is more or less the same everywhere.\n</p><p>Formal written Chinese is for all intents and purposes the same regardless of the local dialect. Even Japanese and Korean use many of the same characters with the same or similar meaning. There is a complication in this, however. Mainland China uses \"simplified characters\", adopted to facilitate literacy during the mid-1950s. Traditional characters are used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and by many overseas Chinese, but also on the mainland in advertising and commercial signs. As a result you will just as often see \u94f6\u884c (<i>y\u00ednh\u00e1ng</i>) as \u9280\u884c for \"bank\". The simplification was however fairly systematic, which means that all hope is not lost for the traveler trying to pick up some sign-reading skills. On the other hand, native speakers usually do not encounter problems reading either script so learning how to write either one would usually suffice.\n</p><p>Note that in calligraphy, the number of scripts is much more varied as different painters use different unique styles, though these have been grouped into five different styles. They are <i>zhuanshu</i>(\u7bc6\u4e66\uff0f\u7bc6\u66f8), <i>lishu</i>(\u96b6\u4e66/\u96b8\u66f8), <i>kaishu</i> (\u6977\u4e66/\u6977\u66f8), <i>xingshu</i> (\u884c\u4e66/\u884c\u66f8) and <i>caoshu</i> (\u8349\u4e66/\u8349\u66f8), of which <i>kaishu</i> is the official script used in China today. When calligraphy is written in <i>kaishu</i>, it is usually traditional Chinese characters that are used due to their superior aesthetic value. The casual traveler can easily get by without learning the other four styles though learning them would certainly help those with a deep interest in traditional Chinese art.\n</p><p>In the far western reaches of the country, Turkic languages such as <a href=\"/en/Uyghur_phrasebook\" title=\"Uyghur phrasebook\">Uighur</a>, Kirghiz, and Kazakh as well as other languages such as <a href=\"/en/Tibetan_phrasebook\" title=\"Tibetan phrasebook\">Tibetan</a> are spoken by some of the non-Han ethnic minorities. In the north and northeast other minority languages including Manchu, <a href=\"/en/Mongolian_phrasebook\" title=\"Mongolian phrasebook\">Mongolian</a> and <a href=\"/en/Korean_phrasebook\" title=\"Korean phrasebook\">Korean</a> are also spoken in areas populated by the respective ethnic minorities. Yunnan, Guizhou, Hainan and Guangxi in the south are also home to many other ethnic minorities such as the Miao, Dong, Zhuang, Bai and the Naxi who speak their own languages. However, with the possible exception of the elderly, Mandarin is generally usable in these areas too, and most younger people are bilingual in their minority language and Mandarin. Sadly some of the minority languages such as Manchu are dying out.\n</p><p><i>See also</i>: <a href=\"/en/Chinese_phrasebook\" title=\"Chinese phrasebook\">Chinese phrasebook</a>, <a href=\"/en/Cantonese_phrasebook\" title=\"Cantonese phrasebook\">Cantonese phrasebook</a>, <a href=\"/en/Minnan_phrasebook\" title=\"Minnan phrasebook\">Minnan phrasebook</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"English_and_other_foreign_language_speakers\">English and other foreign language speakers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=66\" title=\"Edit section: English and other foreign language speakers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>For the last twenty years, Chinese students have been taught English as a compulsory subject starting from late elementary or middle school. Passing an English exam is a requirement to earn a four-year university degree, regardless of major. However, the focus of the instruction at all levels is formal grammar and, to a lesser degree, writing rather than speaking or listening. As a result, most young people in the country can read some English, but might not be able to have a conversation in the language.\n</p><p>Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen do have a higher proportion of English-speaking locals. In certain cities, outside major tourist attractions and establishments catering specifically to foreigners, it is rare to find locals conversant in English. Airline staff and those at large hotels - particularly international chains - usually speak some basic to conversational English, although in-depth skills are seldom seen. \n</p><p>When speaking, as anywhere English language skills are limited, it is helpful to simplify your English. Speak slowly, avoid slang and idioms, and use simple present tense declarative sentence structure.  Don't say \"Would you mind if I come back tomorrow?\", stick to simpler, more abrupt phrasing like \"Tomorrow I will return.\" This brings the phrase closer to its Chinese equivalent and is therefore not necessarily condescending.\n</p><p>One way to meet people is to ask about \"English Corner\" - a time and place in town where local residents, often with a foreign host or speaker, meet to practice spoken English. Typically, they are held on Friday evenings or Sundays in public parks, English training schools, bookstores, and university campuses. There may also be \"Corners\" for French, German, Russian and perhaps other languages.\n</p><p>You may want to consider arranging the services of a tour guide before your trip commences if you wish to go to far flung areas.  This will help you overcome the language barrier where locals in those places will unlikely know any foreign language, let alone English. However, due to lasting effects of the Sino-Soviet friendship treaty, in rural regions, particularly in the north west, Russian, is a commonly encountered language. \n</p><p>It is advisable to have all places you want to visit written down in Chinese characters, also bunch frequent words - you know them from previous trips (even words like hotel, taxi or airport are unknown). Easy way to explain your need to locals is to have Baidu Fanyi (zh-cn: \u767e\u5ea6\u7ffb\u8bd1) app installed. It will translate English and some other languages from and to Chinese. Look for \u82f1\u8bed (English) and click on and set your destination language to \u4e2d\u6587 (Chinese).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Learning_Chinese\">Learning Chinese</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=67\" title=\"Edit section: Learning Chinese\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>See also:</i> <a href=\"#Learn\">Learn</a>\n</p><p>In the West, Chinese has an undeserved reputation for its difficulty. While it is very different from Western languages, a traveler may be surprised to learn that the basic grammar is pretty simple. Verbs are static regardless of subject and whether they are referring to the past, present or future. Genders of nouns do not exist, and there is no separate form of nouns for plurals. The main difficulties are the existence of several consonants not present in European languages (as well as a few vowels found in other European languages but not in English), the use of count words (i.e., the term \"head\" in the phrase \"head of cattle\"), serial verb stacking, the emphasis on verb aspect instead of verb tense, and, of course, the use of tones. \n</p><p>Mandarin, like Vietnamese and Thai, is a tonal language that uses a pitch in sounds to inflict different meanings. \"Ma\" could mean mother, horse, numb, or blame, depending on the tone. Homophones are also common; the same sound at the same pitch usually has dozens of meanings. \"Zhong1\" (\"Zhong\" at the 1st tone) can mean China, loyalty, clock, chime, finish, a bowl, etc. All of them come with different Chinese characters, just the same sound at the same pitch. While homophones are unlikely a problem in most everyday conversations, it is very common for Chinese to ask how to write someone's name by identifying the characters one by one. \"My name is Wang Fei (\u738b\u83f2). Wang is the \"wang\" with three strokes, Fei is the \"fei\" in \"shifei\"(gossip), with a grass on top.\"\n</p><p>Written Chinese looks like a mysterious secret code to some, but if you can recognize so many commercial logos -- usually not logically related, you will be impressed with your capacity to memorize so many characters - most of them are logically related and formed based on certain rules. If you have a smartphone, apps like Pleco, Waygo, and ChineseNow can identify the characters you don't recognize.\n</p><p>There are, in theory, more than 50000 Chinese characters. The good news is that more than 85% have become obsolete, or are rarely used. Like native speakers of many languages, most Chinese couldn't tell you how many characters are required to read a book and never bother to count how many characters they know. One may argue that junior students are supposed to learn at least 2000 characters and graduates in university 5000 characters.\n</p><p>To bridge the gap between recognizing and reading out loud, pinyin was developed, which uses the Roman alphabet as an aid to teaching Chinese. Pronouncing pinyin is not intuitive as certain letters and consonant clusters are used to represent sounds not present in European languages and are thus not pronounced as a westerner would expect. Chinese will not recognize place names or addresses in pinyin; it is always better to use characters for written information.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translators_and_Interpreters\">Translators and Interpreters</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=68\" title=\"Edit section: Translators and Interpreters\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Foreign travelers in China will benefit from having a translator or interpreter supporting them for either leisure or business activities.

The same rule applies in many hair salons which double as brothels. \n</p><p>The non-pink-lit places usually give good massage and generally do not offer sex.

Hairdressers generally do not have facilities for this, but you can sleep on the table in a body massage place or (much better) on the couch used for foot massage. Fees are moderate; this is probably the cheapest way to sleep in China. Note, however, that except in high-end saunas with private rooms, you will share the staff's toilet and there may not be any way to lock up luggage.

Traveling to China is after all a unique chance to learn the basics, or refine already acquired skills, directly from master practitioners in the arts' home country. Many cities have academies that accept beginners, and not knowing Chinese is usually not a problem as you can learn by example and imitation. Calligraphy (\u4e66\u6cd5 <i>sh\u016bf\u01ce</i>), a term that covers both writing characters and painting scrolls (that is, classical landscapes and the like) remains a popular national hobby. Many calligraphers practice by writing with water on sidewalks in city parks. Other traditional arts which offer classes include learning to play traditional Chinese instruments (inquire in shops that sell these as many offer classes), cooking Chinese cuisine, or even singing Beijing Opera (\u4eac\u5267 <i>j\u012bngj\u00f9</i>). Fees are usually extremely modest, and materials you need will not exactly break the bank. The only requirement is being in the same place for a long enough time, and showing sufficient respect; it is better not to join these classes as a tourist attraction.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Martial_Arts_and_Taichi\">Martial Arts and Taichi</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=78\" title=\"Edit section: Martial Arts and Taichi\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As with traditional cultural arts, those with the time and inclination may be interested in studying China's famed martial arts.

Players often attract crowds of on-lookers. Two famous strategy board games that originated in China are Go (\u56f4\u68cb <i>w\u00e9iq\u00ed</i>) and Chinese chess (\u8c61\u68cb <i>xi\u00e0ngq\u00ed</i>). Mahjong (\u9ebb\u5c06 <i>m\u00e1ji\u00e0ng</i>), a game played with tiles, is very popular and often (well-nigh always) played for money, although its vast regional variations mean that you will have to learn new rules everywhere you go. Among the most well known variants of this game are the Cantonese, Taiwanese and Japanese versions. Chinese checkers (\u8df3\u68cb <i>ti\u01ceoq\u00ed</i> ), despite its name, did not originate in China but can be found.

But in colloquial <a href=\"/en/Chinese_phrasebook\" title=\"Chinese phrasebook\">Mandarin</a>, people often say <i>kuai</i> (&#22359;) instead of <i>yuan</i>, and the <i>jiao</i> is also dubbed the <i>mao</i> (&#27611;).

You should be prepared to recognize and handle either version.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Counterfeiting\">Counterfeiting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=82\" title=\"Edit section: Counterfeiting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Counterfeiting is a serious problem. Anyone staying in China for a few months would have certainly experienced it. From the \u00a51 coin, to \u00a510, \u00a520, \u00a550 and \u00a5100 bills, all currency is at risk. The main focus is on the texture of different parts, metal line, change of colours under different lights. Ask anyone how, all of them have their own way. One such strategy for bills is to hold it up to the light: all real bills will have a watermark in the white blank space off to the side. \n</p><p>It is very common for a cashier to scrutinize the banknotes you use to pay a bill. Don't be offended; they are not suggesting that you're using counterfeit currency. They just need to be responsible. When you get change, do the same, scrutinize the banknotes you get, especially notes over \u00a550. Salespeople may try to give you counterfeit money that they took from other customers as change. \n</p><p>Counterfeits from ATMs became a hot topic in recent years, although it is not common. If you are worried, withdraw your money from the bank counter and say \"I worry about jiabi (counterfeit)\". Bank staff seem to be very understanding on this.\n</p><p>It's not unheard of a non licensed money exchanger on China borders to change counterfeits to travellers. If you're not experienced in checking notes, you're highly advised to go to banks. \n</p><p>When you pay with a \u00a550 or \u00a5100 banknote in a shop or taxi, it's socially accepted that you remember the last few digits of your currency number as you pass it. It's possible that they say that your banknote is fake, just make sure you get back what you gave them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Changing_money\">Changing money</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=83\" title=\"Edit section: Changing money\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Although still restricted, the yuan is readily convertible in many countries, especially in Asia. The Hong Kong dollar, US dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and South Korean won can all be easily changed in China. Southeast Asian currencies are generally not accepted, the exception being Singapore dollars (this is changing- certain branches of Bank of Communications, indicated by a sign at teller windows, will exchange Malaysian ringgit, and Travelex will accept almost anything- with a hefty commission). Currency should only be changed at major banks (Bank of China in particular) or with the licensed money changers usually found at airports or high end hotels although these offer very bad rates.\n</p><p>A black market for currency exchange does exist but you are highly advised to avoid as <b>Counterfeiting</b> is a major issue when exchanging money in China. Beware the private money changers found in markets and hanging around large banks. While their exchange rates may look attractive, unless you have a local friend to help you out, do <i>not</i> exchange money with them. It is not uncommon to exchange a large amount of cash only to find that most of what you got is fake. Stick with the official exchange counter in the <b>Bank of China</b> or one of the other large banks as even though you get slightly worse rates, the risk of getting counterfeit bills is close to zero.\n</p><p>Foreign exchange is under tight control in China. Private money changers, widely seen in many tourist spots or shopping malls around the globe, are still uncommon in China. In a bank, it usually takes 5 minutes to 60 minutes to process the exchange, sometimes a little faster in an hotel, depending on their experience. Generally speaking bank branches in major cities know the procedure and are relatively quick while even main branches in third and fourth tier cities can take much longer.\n</p><p>Regardless of location, you will need to fill a form and show your passport. Your passport will be photocopied and scanned. Keep the exchange receipt if you plan to leave the country with larger sum of money. Note that not all banks with the \"Exchange\" logo will exchange money for non-customers or for all currencies in cash. For example, Standard Chartered will only exchange cash for its customers and will only do USD and HKD in cash (but opening an account is quick and doable even on a tourist visa, and they offer a better cash exchange rate than most local banks).\n</p><p>Exchanging US currency for RMB can be simple, but expect the bills to be heavily scrutinized before the exchange is processed. Opportunities to buy RMB before entering China, for example when coming overland from Hong Kong or Vietnam, should be taken, as the rates are better. The same is true going the other way - selling just across the border will often net a more favourable rate. Also, most international banks will allow you to get a cash advance via a debit or credit card at a Chinese ATM. However, the rates for such actions are often unfavourable and may include steep service charges. It's useful to carry an international currency such as British pounds, US dollars, or Japanese yen to fall back on should you not have access to a cash machine.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"ATM_cards\">ATM cards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=84\" title=\"Edit section: ATM cards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>ATMs are all over the country but most ATMs outside the large cities that accept Cirrus, PLUS, VISA and MasterCard network are owned by Bank of China or the Industrial and Commercial Bank. In big cities like Shanghai most ATMs will take Visa/Plus/MC/Maestro/Cirrus. However, cash advances from Diner's Club, American Express, or JCB cards are more difficult. For visitors from Hong Kong or Macau, the only ATMs that natively take JETCO cards are Bank of East Asia ATMs. Most ATMs will charge a small and flat fee. \n</p><p>Note: Minsheng Bank, Shenzhen Development Bank, and Bank of Shanghai ATMs will all display PLUS/Cirrus/Maestro logos. In reality, only selected ATMs of theirs are linked into these networks, and there is usually no indication until you try. This is true of many other banks' ATMs, even Agricultural Bank of China (one of the big four).\n</p><p>Before travelling, find out if your home bank charges a currency conversion fee (often between 0-3%) on such transactions. It is worth opening a zero conversion fee account beforehand if possible. Otherwise it would be better to open a local account on arrival to store money in if staying for a sufficiently long time. \n</p><p>If you have trouble because the ATM requires a 6-digit PIN and your PIN only has 4 digits, try adding 2 zeros before it. If you find yourself in a town with a Bank of China branch but no international network-capable ATM, it is usually possible to get a cash advance on a credit card inside the bank. Just ask.\n</p><p>UnionPay, the local ATM card network, has made agreements with various ATM card networks across the globe. If your card is covered, any ATM in China will accept withdrawals and balance inquiries from your card. Currently covered are NYCE and Pulse in America (also applies to cash advances from Discover cards), Interac in Canada, and LINK in the UK. \n</p><p>Also, if your bank is part of the Global ATM Alliance, be aware that China Construction Bank is the local partner for fee-free withdrawals.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Travellers_cheques\">Travellers cheques</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=85\" title=\"Edit section: Travellers cheques\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most major banks and upmarket hotels will exchange travellers' cheques. You will need identification and your signature on the cheques, your ID, and your signature in front of the teller will be scrutinized very closely. In second-tier cities you will need to go to the head branch of Bank of China or Merchants' Bank. Exchanging travellers cheques is usually slower than exchanging cash.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Foreign_currency\">Foreign currency</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=86\" title=\"Edit section: Foreign currency\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Foreign currencies, including the Hong Kong dollar or US dollar, are rarely seen as a substitute for RMB except in several 5-star hotels, some shops on the Hong Kong-Shenzhen border, and stock exchanges. You are unlikely to use other currencies in most transactions (after all, the average visitor comes to China to sight-see and shop, not to play day-trader, but for the curious, the minimum balance for US$ trading is USD1000 with USD19 account opening fee while the minimum for HKD trading is HKD5000). If you are running out of money and only have dollars in your pocket, it usually means that you don't have money to pay the bill without a trip to a bank or one of the very few automatic currency exchange machines scattered around Tier 1 cities. Many shops won't accept it, having no idea on exchange rate or how to check if the bills are counterfeit.\n</p><p>However, with credit or debit cards, this can become a problem in reverse; a merchant may choose to charge you in your home currency instead of local currency. When they do so (a practice referred to as \"dynamic currency conversion\" or DCC), they apply a commission on top of the exchange rate, typically 3%, sometimes more. Make sure you understand what is happening, and to understand the terms associated with your card; you may get charged by your bank on top simply for having the transaction occur overseas regardless of currency, or you may have a card that exchanges currency for you without any additional commission. In both cases DCC places you at a disadvantage. Ask the merchant to void the transaction and to process it again in local currency.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Electronic_transfers\">Electronic transfers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=87\" title=\"Edit section: Electronic transfers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Electronic money transfers to another country are no longer as difficult as they used to be. Just about every bank in the big cities offers this service nowadays. On the other hand, service charges are variable (depends on the sending and receiving bank), the staff is sometimes ill-trained, and the process can take up to a week to clear. Alternatively, you may choose to look for a Chinese branch of a foreign or Hong Kong-based bank to do transfers. This is easier in the big cities, though. \n</p><p>It will be MUCH easier to do transfers if you have an dual-currency account with the Bank of China - opened at the branch from which you plan to get your money. Electronic transfers to dual currency accounts incur no or very low fees although it will usually take about one week. Transfers to Chinese accounts from overseas also take from three to ten business days. All you need to start an account is your passport, visa and a small initial deposit (can be RMB) plus the new-account fee (\u00a510-20). If you open a foreign currency account or a dual currency account, be sure to check if you will be able to access it in another province or overseas. Alternatively, for visitors from the US, Wells Fargo offers a service called ExpressSend that allows someone to send money from the US and have it arrive at a China Agricultural Bank account on the same day. \n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Western_Union\">Western Union</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=88\" title=\"Edit section: Western Union\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Western Union has deals with China Agricultural Bank and with China Post so there are a lot of Western Union signs around. China Construction Bank (ICBC) has also been known to accept Western Union. This method is what overseas Chinese sending money to relatives, or expats sending money out of China, generally use; it is generally easier and cheaper than the banks. A list of locations is available through Western Union's website. There may, however, be problems. Their system may be down or the employee you deal with may ask for silly things &#8212; for an overseas transfer, the recipient's passport and visa numbers, or for a within-China transfer, cash in US dollars. \n</p><p>It is sometimes difficult to find the branch listed on the Western Union website, and the process of getting the transfer completed can take a long time. Expect to take your time finding the branch, and spending 1+ hours inside the bank completing the transaction. Foreigners will almost certainly need a passport. If you speak Chinese then this probably wouldn't take so long. Just try another branch if you are having difficulties. The exchange rate through Western Union has historically been quite good, and this can be a viable way to send money to yourself or to someone else in China. Just make sure you have a safe place to hold that big wad of RMB if you choose to receive the transfer in cash!\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Credit_cards\">Credit cards</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=89\" title=\"Edit section: Credit cards\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Outside of star-rated or chain hotels, major supermarkets, and high-class restaurants, credit cards are generally not accepted and most transactions will require cash. The most popular credit card in China is UnionPay, and due to an alliance between Discover and UnionPay, those with Discover credit cards will find that their card is much more widely accepted (under the UnionPay system) than those with Visa/Mastercard/American Express. Most convenience stores take UnionPay, as do most restaurant chains, stores selling high-value items, grocery store chains, and most ATMs. Beware of <a href=\"/en/Pickpockets\" title=\"Pickpockets\">pickpockets</a>. \n</p><p>Many department stores and large grocery stores have point-of-sale terminals for Chinese bank cards; typically these will not work for foreign cards (unless it is also a UnionPay card). However, because of the nature of Discover's agreement with the UnionPay network, it is treated as a domestic card at ATMs and point-of-sale. If you are going to spend a lot of time in China and use significant amounts of money, consider getting a Chinese bank account if signing up for a Discover card is impractical. Ideally, if in a big city and later travelling to smaller ones, try signing up for an account with smaller banks like Woori Bank or Ping An Bank; these offer free inter-bank ATM withdrawals anywhere in China (Ping An Bank also offers free withdrawals overseas, a plus if travelling to nearby countries later). Alternatively, Travelex offers UnionPay Cash Passports in certain countries.\n</p><p>As with debit cards, Chinese retail clerks will usually present the POS credit card terminal to the cardholder for entry of a PIN for chip-and-pin cards. Visitors from sign-only or chip-and-sign countries like the United States should attempt to explain that fact to the clerk or simply hit the green button or Enter for no PIN. Chinese terminals have old-fashioned miniature dot-matrix printers which print receipts on carbon-copy duplicate paper.  If no PIN was entered, the clerk will then present the receipt to the cardholder for a hard copy signature, then separate the layers and give the carbon copy to the cardholder.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Costs\">Costs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=90\" title=\"Edit section: Costs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While China is no longer the bargain destination it was during the 1990's, it remains quite affordable. Unless you are heading to Hong Kong or Macau, the mainland is generally much less expensive - from a traveller's perspective - than industrialized countries. If you eat local food, use public transportation and stay in very inexpensive budget hotels or hostels then \u00a5200 to \u00a5300 is a serviceable daily backpacker budget. As of 2014 there were still many street vendors selling various products for \u00a51 a piece. It's potentially risky to dine on street food but the point is there is a wide range of options. However, if you want to live an extravagant lifestyle and eat only the best Chinese delicacies or upmarket Western food and stay in luxury hotels, then even \u00a53,000 a day would not be enough. There is a high degree of variation in prices depending on where you go. First-tier cities generally cost more than second-tier ones, and much more than rural and central and western parts of the country.\n</p><p>Although accommodation, food, and travel can all still be done quite cheaply in China, the prices of tourist attractions (historical sites as well as national parks) are increasing rapidly. If you have a tick list of things you want to see, and are on a backpackers budget, this will be a sizeable portion of your budget (potentially 25-50%). Entry fees range from &#165;30 to &#165;300 with the norm of major scenic sites tending around &#165;100.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tipping\">Tipping</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=91\" title=\"Edit section: Tipping\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>As a general rule, tipping is not practised anywhere in China.  When leaving a tip on your table, it is common to see a waiter chase after you to return the money you \"forgot\" to take.  \n</p><p>In a hotel, it is widely accepted not to tip for room service, airport service, taxis or anything else -- exceptions can be made and especially hotels which cater to foreign clients, staff will not be offended if they receive a tip. Masseurs in some areas such as Shenzhen have been known to ask for a tip. However, if they become pushy at getting tips most Chinese see this as extortion and an immoral practice, so just be firm if you don't wish to give any. \n</p><p>In China, compliments over service is usually expressed in implicit ways. If you are a smoker, you are expected to pass a cigarette to the service staff or manager. Offering a seat or drink would also be seen as a nice gesture. \n</p><p>Tipping in the wrong way can lead to embarrassment, and can sometimes be insulting, because you are suggesting that the relationship is based on money, not friendship.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Banking\">Banking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=92\" title=\"Edit section: Banking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Opening a bank account in China is a very straightforward process. The \"big four\" banks in China are the <b>Bank of China</b> (\u4e2d\u56fd\u94f6\u884c), <b>China Construction Bank</b> (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5efa\u8bbe\u94f6\u884c), <b>Agricultural Bank of China</b> (\u4e2d\u56fd\u519c\u4e1a\u94f6\u884c) and <b>Industrial and Commercial Bank of China</b> (\u4e2d\u56fd\u5de5\u5546\u94f6\u884c). For locally-owned banks you only need your passport with a valid visa (tourist visas are acceptable). Some banks such as Bank of East Asia will require proof of residence, but this restriction mostly applies to banks based in Hong Kong. For long-term travel or residence, a Chinese bank account is a very good idea. Depending on the bank, the PIN and/or ID may be required for withdrawals at the counter (ask beforehand; some foreign banks only require a signature for withdrawal; if you're not comfortable with that don't open an account there) although deposits can be made no questions asked if you have the bank book or card they issued with your account. Depending on the bank, the minimum initial deposit is \u00a51-100 (some multinational banks like Citibank or DBS require five-digit minimum deposits; these banks are to be avoided for the average person). You may receive a bank book in which will record all transactions and balances - including foreign currency balances. However, most banks in big cities offer card-only accounts by default; if you want a bank book you'll have to ask unless they don't issue ATM cards at all (such as Shinhan Bank or Dah Sing Bank) Banks usually charge a fee (around 1%) for depositing and withdrawing money in a different city than the one you opened your account in (if opening with Woori Bank, they offer unlimited ATM withdrawals at any ATM in China until June 2011, and Wing Hang Bank offers free withdrawals anywhere in the world, with the card fee waived until 2014). ATMs are now present in almost all towns and cities except in the most remote areas. Many ATMs accept Visa, Mastercard, AMEX, Maestro, and Plus debit and credit cards although some only accept UnionPay and Pulse, Interac, or Link ATM cards.\n</p><p>Also, in Shanghai, most of the smaller local banks have relations with each other allowing for no-fee interbank deposits for any amount and withdrawals over \u00a53,000. Also, any Bank of Shanghai deposit-capable ATM can do deposits for any bank with a Shanghai-issued account.\n</p><p><b>Bank of China</b>\nBank of China ATMs are occasionally the only ATMs where an international bank card will work. This bank has good international banking experience.\n</p><p><b>China Construction Bank &amp; Bank of America</b>\nBank of America and China Construction Bank have business ties, and because of this, Bank of America customers can use China Construction Bank ATM's without any fees to withdraw RMB.\n</p><p><b>China Merchants Bank</b>\nThis bank gets best reviews from expatriates as of July 2009. \n</p><p><b>Standard Chartered</b>\nThis bank is also very expat-friendly (it is based in the UK), however branches outside the big cities are lacking. They offer unlimited interbank ATM withdrawals within the city the card was issued in as long as the amount drawn is over \u00a52000 each time and they also offer multiple foreign-currency investment products.\n</p><p><b>Woori Bank</b>\nIt has even fewer branches than Standard Chartered, but offers the Shanghai Tourist Card, which gives discounts at assorted restaurants and half-price tickets to various attractions, as a debit card. Locally-owned banks only issue this as a credit card, which foreigners can't get, so this is the better choice if travelling to Shanghai. They also offer unlimited free ATM withdrawals anywhere in China. As a Korean bank, they typically cater to Koreans and it shows in the level of customer service.\n</p><p><b>ICBC</b>\nThe largest bank in China.\n</p><p>Do note that if you are employed in China, you may not get a choice: many companies and schools deposit into only one bank, and therefore you must have an account with that bank to get paid. Of course you may later transfer the money to an account with a bank of choosing.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shopping\">Shopping</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=93\" title=\"Edit section: Shopping\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Antiquities Banned From Export</b><br />\nChina's government passed a law in May 2007 banning the export of antiques from before 1911. It is thus illegal to take antiques out of China. Even antiques from before 1911 bought in proper auctions cannot be taken out of the country. As violation of this law could lead to heavy fines and a possible jail term, it would be wise to heed it. However if you let vendors know you are aware of this law they may lower their prices since they know you know their \"antiques\" really aren't Ming Dynasty originals.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p><br />\nAs China's emergent middle class finds itself with increasing amounts of disposable income, shopping has become a national pastime. A wide range of goods is available to suit any budget. \n</p><p>Do not expect everything to be cheap. The prices of imported brand name items, such as camping equipment, mountain bikes, mobile phones and electronics, cosmetics, personal care products, sportswear, cheese, chocolate, coffee and milk powder are often higher than overseas. Many Chinese tourists would buy such items in Hong Kong, not in mainland China.\n</p><p>In most brand name shops, upscale malls and supermarkets, the prices already have Value-Added Tax (VAT) and any sales tax included. Thus, anything with a marked price tends to be sold at that price or, perhaps, slightly below especially if you pay cash and do not require a receipt for your purchase. For unmarked goods, there is <b>wide</b> room for bargaining.\n</p><p>Regarding discounts, Chinese make sales using the character: \u6298 (<i>zh\u00e9</i>) which represented the fraction of the original price you pay. For example, 8\u6298 refers to 20% off; 6.5\u6298 is equal to 35% off. \n</p><p>China excels in handmade items, partly because of long traditions of exquisite artisanship and partly because labour is still comparatively inexpensive. Take your time, look closely at quality and ask questions, but don't take all the answers at face value! Many visitors come looking for antiques, and hunting in the flea markets can be great fun. The overwhelming majority of the \"antique\" items you will be shown are fakes, no matter how convincing they look and no matter what the vendor says. Do not spend serious money unless you know what you are doing, since novices are almost always taken for a ride.\n</p>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:392px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:China_porcelain.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/29/China_porcelain.jpg/390px-China_porcelain.jpg\" width=\"390\" height=\"293\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/29/China_porcelain.jpg/585px-China_porcelain.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/29/China_porcelain.jpg/780px-China_porcelain.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1024\" data-file-height=\"768\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:China_porcelain.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Porcelain at Shanghai's antique market</div></div></div>\n<ul><li> <b>Porcelain</b> with a long history of porcelain manufacture, China still makes great porcelain today. Most visitors are familiar with Ming-style blue and white, but the variety of glazes is much greater, including many lovely monochrome glazes which are worth seeking out. Specialist shops near hotels and the top floors of department stores are a good place to start, though not the cheapest. The \"antique\" markets are also a good place to find reproductions, though it can be hard to escape from vendors' attempts to convince you that their items are genuine antiques (with prices to match). Two of the most famous centers for porcelain are <a href=\"/en/Jingdezhen\" title=\"Jingdezhen\">Jingdezhen</a> and Quanzhou.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Furniture</b> in the 1990s and 2000s China become a major source of antique furniture, mostly sourced from the vast countryside. As the supply of old items has dwindled many of the restorers are now turning to making new items using the old styles. The quality of new pieces is often excellent and some great bargains can still be had in new and old items. Furniture tends to be concentrated in large warehouses on the outskirts of cities; Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu all have plenty of these and hotels can tell you how to find them. Major sellers can also arrange international shipment in most cases. <a href=\"/en/Zhongshan\" title=\"Zhongshan\">Zhongshan</a> in particular has a huge furniture market.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Art and Fine Art</b> the art scene in China is divided into three non-interacting parts. First, there are the traditional painting academies which specialize in \"classical\" painting (bird and flower, landscapes with rocks and water, calligraphy), with conservative attitudes and serving up painting that conforms to the traditional image of Chinese art. Second, there is a burgeoning modern art scene, including oil painting, photography and sculpture, bearing little relation to the former type. Both \"scenes\" are worth checking out and include the full range from the glorious to the dreadful. The centre of the modern scene is undoubtedly Beijing, where the Da Shan Zi (sometimes called 798) warehouse district is emerging as the new frontier for galleries, reminiscent of New York's Soho in the mid-80s. The third arts scene fits closely with China's prowess in mass-production. China has become famous for producing hand painted reproductions of great works. The Shenzhen suburb of Dafen is particularly renowned for its reproductions.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Jade</b> There are two types of Jade in China today: one type is pale and almost colorless and is made from a variety of stones mined in China. The other type is green in color and is imported from <a href=\"/en/Myanmar\" title=\"Myanmar\">Myanmar</a> (Burma) - if genuine! The first thing to be aware of when buying Jade is that you will get what you pay for (at best). Genuine Burmese jade with a good green colour is extraordinarily expensive and the \"cheap\" green jade you will see in the markets is made either from synthetic stone or from natural stone that has been coloured with a green dye. When buying jade look closely at the quality of the carving: How well finished is it? Is it refined, or crude with tool marks visible? The quality of the stone often goes along with the quality of the carving. Take your time and compare prices before buying. If you are going to spend a fair sum of money, do it in specialist stores, not flea markets. <a href=\"/en/Khotan\" title=\"Khotan\">Khotan</a> in Xinjiang is a famous area for jade production.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Carpets</b> China is home to a remarkable variety of carpet-making traditions. These include Mongolian, Ningxia, Tibetan and modern types. Many tourists come looking for silk carpets although these are actually a fairly recent tradition with most of the designs being taken from middle-eastern traditions rather than reflecting Chinese designs. Be aware that though the workmanship is quite fine on these carpets they often skimp on materials, particularly dyes. These are prone to fading and colour change, especially if the carpet is displayed in a brightly lit place. Some excellent wool carpets are also made in China. Tibetan carpets are amongst the best in terms of quality and construction, but be aware that most carpets described as Tibetan are not actually made in Tibet, with a few notable exceptions. As with jade, best to buy from stores with a reputation to uphold.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Pearls &amp; Pearl Jewellery</b> cultured Akoya and freshwater pearls are mass-produced and sold at markets across China. The use of large scale aquaculture makes pearl jewellery affordable and widely available. Big, lustrous, near-round and round freshwater pearls come out with a variety of colours and overtones. In addition to jewellery, pearl-based cosmetics are also widely available.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Silver Coins</b> a variety of silver coins are sold in China's markets with good reason: in the 19th century, the emperor decreed that foreigners had to pay for all trade goods in silver. The United States even minted a special silver \"trade dollar\" just to meet this requirement. Collectors can find Mexican, U.S., French Indochinese, Chinese and other silver dollars available for purchase, mostly dated 1850-1920. Unfortunately, most of the coins on sale now are counterfeit. If you want to collect coins, carry a small portable scale to check their weights. In a tourist area, expect at least 90% to fail this simple test.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Other arts and Crafts</b> Other items to look for include Cloisonne (coloured enamels on a metal base), lacquer work, opera masks, kites, shadow puppets, Socialist-realist propaganda posters, wood carvings, scholar's rocks (decorative rocks, some natural, some less so), paper-cuts, and so on.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Luxury goods</b> such as jade, expensive ceramics and other artwork, antiques or carpets are risky. Most of the antique furniture available today are replicas. Much of the jade is either glass or low quality stone that has been dyed a nice green; some is even plastic. Various stone carvings are actually moulded glass. The samurai swords are mostly either inferior weapons mass produced for the Japanese military and Manchurian soldiers in World War II or modern Chinese copies. At the right price, any of such goods can be a very good buy. However, none of them are worth anywhere near the price of real top-quality goods. Unless you are an expert on whatever you want to buy, you are quite likely to get sold low quality merchandise at high prices. \n</p><p>There are two solutions. Either stick to the cheaper products, some of which are quite nice as keepsakes, or if you do decide to spend a substantial amount, then deal with a large and reputable vendor; you may not get the bargains an expert could find elsewhere, but you probably won't get cheated either.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Clothing\">Clothing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=94\" title=\"Edit section: Clothing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:222px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Nanjing_Lu_Zai_Baitian.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d5/Nanjing_Lu_Zai_Baitian.jpeg/220px-Nanjing_Lu_Zai_Baitian.jpeg\" width=\"220\" height=\"147\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d5/Nanjing_Lu_Zai_Baitian.jpeg/330px-Nanjing_Lu_Zai_Baitian.jpeg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d5/Nanjing_Lu_Zai_Baitian.jpeg/440px-Nanjing_Lu_Zai_Baitian.jpeg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3072\" data-file-height=\"2048\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Nanjing_Lu_Zai_Baitian.jpeg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Nanjing Road in Shanghai</div></div></div>\n<p>China is one of the world's leading manufacturers of clothing, shoes and accessories. Name-brand goods, whether Chinese or foreign, tend to be expensive when compared with the unbranded clothing sold in markets throughout the country. See next section for additional comment. Chinese brands, similar in look, feel and style to their foreign counterparts, are often an excellent deal. Cheap unbranded clothing is also often cheaply manufactured; check the seams and stitching before making a purchase.\n</p><p>Travellers would be wise to try on any item they wish to purchase as sizes tend to be very erratic. Items of clothing which may be a size XL in the US can be anywhere from an L to a XXXL in China. Most nicer stores have a tailor on call who will adjust the length and hem of pants in 15-30min for free. \n</p><p>There are very affordable tailors anywhere in China. In the major cities, some of them can make a fine job of Western-style garments. Shirts, pants and suits can be measured, fitted, assembled and delivered within three days in many cases. Some tailors have their own fabric selections while others require customers to purchase it in advance from fabric markets. The quality of the tailors, as everywhere, varies widely. More reputable tailors will often come to hotels to do measurements, fittings and final sales.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Brand-name_goods\">Brand-name goods</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=95\" title=\"Edit section: Brand-name goods\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Items with <b>big worldwide brand labels</b> sold in China may be bogus, especially expensive and exclusive popular brands. By no means all are bogus; virtually all major brands market in China, but some will be unauthorized or downright bogus. If you are buying genuine branded foreign goods, particularly <i>haute couture</i> brands such as Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Prada, or popular brands such as Nike or Adidas, be aware that they will not be cheaper than buying them in Western countries.  Wealthy Chinese who can afford to travel often purchase luxury brand name goods in Hong Kong or overseas, as it is significantly cheaper than buying them in mainland China. \n</p><p>There are a number of sources of potential knock-offs or fake brand name goods.\n</p>\n<ul><li> The most common variant comes from a Chinese firm that gets a contract to deliver, say, 100,000 shirts to BigBrand. They actually have to make a few more than that because some will fail quality control. Maybe 105,000? What the heck, make 125,000. Any extras will be easy to sell; after all they have the BigBrand label. So 25,000 shirts &#8212; a few \"factory seconds\" and many perfectly good shirts &#8212; arrive on the Chinese market, without BigBrand's authorization. A traveler might be happy to buy these &#8212; just check carefully to avoid the seconds and you get exactly the shirt BigBrand sells for a much better price.</li>\n<li> However, it doesn't end there. If the factory owner is greedy, he goes on to crank out a bunch more. Only now he doesn't have to worry about BigBrand's strict quality control. He can cut a few corners, slap the BigBrand label on them, and make a great profit. These may or may not be a good buy, but in any case they are not what you would expect from BigBrand.</li>\n<li> Finally, of course, some other factory may be cranking out utterly bogus \"BigBrand\" shirts. These outright forgeries often misspell the brand name which is a dead giveaway.</li></ul>\n<p>Fake brand oddities include items such as a reversible jacket with \"Adidas\" on one side and \"Nike\" on the other or shirts with more than one brand. While these might be interesting curiosities, they obviously are not genuine examples of either brand.\n</p><p>There are two basic rules for dealing with expensive brand name goods in China.\n</p>\n<ul><li> First, you cannot just trust the brand; inspect the goods carefully for flaws. Check the spelling on labels.</li>\n<li> Second, if the deal seems too good to be true, be very suspicious. China makes a lot of good cheap products, but a hundred dollar LV handbag is utterly certain to be bogus. </li></ul>\n<p>Bogus goods can cause legal problems. Selling \"pirate\" DVDs or forged brand name goods is illegal in China, but enforcement is lax. It is generally much less lax at customs for travelers' home countries. Customs officials will seize pirated DVDs or bogus brand name goods if they find them. Some Western travelers have even reported having to pay hefty fines after being caught returning home with bogus products.\n</p><p>Counterfeit and swing production markets in Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Beijing are nonetheless fantastically amusing and a great place to get a completely new \"designer\" wardrobe for a fraction of the cost in a Western country. Feel free to purchase these items but <b>remove the tags</b> prior to taking them home. If you have a suitcase full of brand new tagged designer knock-offs or swing produced clothes, you are likely to be hassled by customs.  The likely worst case scenario is you will lose the items and receive a fine; the best case scenario is you will lose the items. Simply remove the tags and they will almost certainly go unnoticed with the rest of your belongings.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Software.2C_Music_and_Movies\">Software, Music and Movies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=96\" title=\"Edit section: Software, Music and Movies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most CDs (music or software) and DVDs in China are unauthorized copies. The ones that sell for \u00a56-10 and come in cheap flat paper envelopes are absolutely certain to be bogus. Some of the ones at higher prices with better packaging might be legal copies, but it can be hard to tell. Probably the best way to avoid bogus discs is to buy at one of the larger bookstores or department stores; most of these have a CD/DVD section. The prices are \u00a515-40. \n</p><p>Some good checks, or dead giveaways, for a fake are:\n</p>\n<ul><li> Credits on the back of the case which do not match the movie.</li>\n<li> Covers which are obviously made from cinema poster images (\"Coming Soon\", the release date, etc. mentioned on them.)</li>\n<li> Covers which feature uncomplimentary reviews (\"Heavy on the spice and light on the meat\", \"Nothing more than you could get from an episode of CSI\", etc.)</li></ul>\n<p>In stores, it is usually acceptable to ask the owner to test the DVD to make sure it works and has the correct language soundtrack.\n</p><p>If you buy DVDs or CDs and plan to take them home, be sure to get a receipt that will prove your good faith to Western customs officers.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Endangered_species\">Endangered species</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=97\" title=\"Edit section: Endangered species\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are products that are fairly common in China which you should avoid purchasing &#8212; coral, ivory, and parts from endangered animal species. China's economic miracle has been a disaster for the world's wildlife and has left such species as the elephant, tiger, rhinoceros, Tibetan antelope and Snow Lotus decimated or on the verge of extinction. The city of Pingyao and several markets on the outskirts of Beijing are notorious for selling rare animal skins, furs, claws, horns, skulls, bones, and other parts from endangered (even extinct) species. Anyone purchasing such items is encouraging the further destruction of the species in question. \n</p><p>It is illegal to trade in such products in nearly all countries, including China, under the <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.cites.org/index.html\">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a>. Enforcement in China is somewhat lax, but anyone buying such products risks serious hassles either when trying to leave China with them or when trying to import them into another country. This can bring substantial fines and/or jail time. So if a store clerk seems eager to sell you a leopard skin or an ivory trinket, use your better judgment and move on.\n</p><p>Ivory is an odd special case. Trade in modern ivory is illegal worldwide, but some antique ivory items are legal. If you want to take any ivory items home, there will be paperwork &#8212; at an absolute minimum, you will need a letter from a reputable dealer stating the date of origin. Check with your own country's customs department for other requirements. Also remember that China restricts export of anything older than 1911 (see infobox), and that many of the \"ivory\" items in China are fakes made from various synthetics or ground bone.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bargaining\">Bargaining</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=98\" title=\"Edit section: Bargaining\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p><i>See also</i>: <a href=\"/en/How_to_haggle\" title=\"How to haggle\">How to haggle</a>\n</p><p>Bargaining is a national pastime in China. You can bargain over almost anything, and sometimes it's even possible to ask for discount in a restaurant at the last minute before you check the bill. Many restaurants or bars will willingly offer a free dish or two (such as a fruit plate in a KTV) if you have made a particularly large order. Shopping malls are less willing to bargain, but why not ask \"Will I get a gift?\"\n</p><p>Unlike many southeast Asian countries, the tourism industry in China is overwhelmingly dominated by Chinese businesses, not westerners running businesses for their own such as seen in places like Bangkok's <a href=\"/en/Khao_San_Road\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Khao San Road\">Khao San Road</a> or Saigon's Pham Ngu Lao. Merchants in touristy areas, particularly street and sidewalk-stall sellers, are masters in exploiting the wallets of foreigners. They can also be very pushy, sometimes even grabbing your hands. Prices are almost always posted, but they are all substantially marked up, normally 2-3 times. Some items like silk fans (largest size: 1'2\") are posted as &#165;60-75, but the lowest price is actually just &#165;10. Therefore it's often better to buy souvenirs somewhere just a few blocks away from the tourist spots. Local Chinese tourists have no issue with posted prices because they are all well trained in the art of bargaining. Foreigners always pay more for everything negotiable in China but remember that Chinese whose accents identify them as being from other provinces also pay higher prices than locals.\n</p><p>The purchasing power of the nouveau riche in China makes the place not always cheap any more. When you go to tourist spots, it is possible to see a &#165;1,000 skirt tailor-made by a designer, &#165;2,000 per a bag of tea, or dozens of thousands for silverware. \n</p><p>It is hard to tell what price to offer when starting negotiations. Depending on the city, product or market in question, 5% to 50% of the posted price or vendor's first offer is common. Do note that if someone offers you too-great-to-be-true discount, it could be a sign that the goods are of less than great quality. The rule of thumb is to walk around and compare. In tourist spots, it's common to ask for a 30-50% discount, but in a place catering to local people, asking for a 50% discount will only make a fool of yourself.\n</p><p>In a tourist places, don't take what merchants say seriously. When you ask for a 50% discount, they may be appalled and show scorn; it's a favourite drama. Souvenirs, including \"antiques\", are almost all standard products from factories. Compare more. Do be aware that in tourist markets, the room for negotiation is not as wide as it used to be. With so many tourists all shopping for the same products, vendors know they can make high margins and may not be as amenable to negotiating. If your starting price is too low, they may dismiss you because trying to get the margin they want isn't worth their time.\n</p><p>Souvenirs in some places may have no connection with the history of the place, and change frequently, often appearing to be cheap nick nacks the stallholders association picked up cheap and in bulk from a disposal sale. \n</p><p>In this former communist country, most local people still expect a standard price for grocery products and see it as 'black-hearted' (\u9ed1\u5fc3 h\u0113ix\u012bn) to charge too much, even if the shops are in a major business district. However, in a tourist place where rental payments are skyrocketing, if someone sells you a bottle of Coca Cola for &#165;5 (usually &#165;3 in most places), you may have a chance to bargain a little bit too. It sometimes works, but not all the time.\n</p><p>Souvenir shops for jewellery, herbs, and tea recommended by hotel staff can also be tricky. While it is common that the staff takes tourists to places that give them commission, it is also common that they take you to certain places because the establishment actually offers decent products and prices. If you make a show of being overly cautious, it is likely to offend your hosts because you are suggesting a 'good guy' is actually a cheater.\n</p><p>In several places like the <a href=\"/en/Lijiang\" title=\"Lijiang\">Lijiang</a> Ancient City, when the ethnic horse carriage drivers stop by a souvenir shop, assume that you're paying commission. These carriage operators are notoriously known for extorting money from shops, or creating trouble if the shops refuse to pay. The local government usually avoids intervening in these cases where minority ethnic groups are involved.\n</p><p>Many group tours include mandatory visits to Chinese medicine hospitals such as the National Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, silk , tea, or jade factories or similar shops. The goods are often expensive and include a commission for the tour guide or group. Use your judgement if you want to buy anything. However, the shops visited on tours can offer competitive prices and safe, reliable, international shipping for goods like silk and jade.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Basics\">Basics</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=99\" title=\"Edit section: Basics\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Unless you are fortunate enough to have a major supermarket or expat-focused grocery store within walking distance of your hotel (see next section below), the most convenient option for basic supplies and groceries will almost always be a convenience store. Major chains in China include Kedi, Alldays, FamilyMart, and 7-Eleven. China has belatedly caught up with East Asia's love affair with convenience stores, to the point where the first-tier cities like Beijing and Shanghai have become oversaturated with them.    \n</p><p>Many convenience stores sell individual toilet paper rolls, which are a necessity for touring China as many public restrooms do not have toilet paper. Although supermarkets also sell toilet paper, they tend to sell it in 6 or 10-packs which are too much for tourists.\n</p><p>Some discount and mid-market department stores in China also have groceries sections.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Western_goods\">Western goods</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=100\" title=\"Edit section: Western goods\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Areas with large expatriate communities like <a href=\"/en/Beijing\" title=\"Beijing\">Beijing</a>, <a href=\"/en/Shanghai\" title=\"Shanghai\">Shanghai</a>, <a href=\"/en/Guangzhou\" title=\"Guangzhou\">Guangzhou</a> and <a href=\"/en/Shenzhen\" title=\"Shenzhen\">Shenzhen</a> have specialty grocery stores catering to those communities. Size and selection may vary, between city to city and store brand. They usually stock imported snacks, alcohol, and specialty groceries such as meats and cheeses and are often more expensive. See individual articles for details.\n</p><p>Several Western-owned supermarket chains are widespread in China &#8212; Wal-mart (\u6c83\u5c14\u739b W\u00f2\u011brm\u01ce), Metro (\u9ea6\u5fb7\u9f99 M\u00e0id\u00e9l\u00f3ng), TESCO, and Carrefour (\u5bb6\u4e50\u798f Ji\u0101l\u00e8f\u00fa). All have some Western groceries - often at high prices. However, the availability of foreign products diminishes at their branches in second or third-tier cities. Metro is probably the best of these; in particular it usually has a fine selection of alcohol. Asian-owned chains include Jusco (\u4f73\u4e16\u5ba2 Ji\u0101sh\u00eck\u00e8), RT-Mart (\u5927\u6f64\u767c D\u00e0r\u00f9nf\u0101) , LOTTE Mart (\u4e50\u5929\u739b\u7279 Letianmate), Lotus, and SM; these also carry imported goods. Some larger Chinese chains such as Beijing Hualian (\u5317\u4eac\u534e\u8054 B\u011bij\u012bng Hu\u00e1li\u00e1n) also carry a limited selection of foreign products. Furthermore, there are a lot of online services providing home delivery of food and drinks. Two most famous nationwide websites are M1NT Cellars, offering imported wines and all kinds of alcoholic beverages, and Sherpa, delivering food and soft drinks right at your door step.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tobacco_products\">Tobacco products</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=101\" title=\"Edit section: Tobacco products\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>While China has experienced a declining trend for smoking, it is still a popular habit and cigarettes (\u9999\u70df xi\u0101ngy\u0101n) are generally cheap. Cigarettes can be purchased from small neighbourhood stores, convenience stores, counters located in supermarkets and in department stores.\n</p><p>Most mainstream Chinese brands sell at around \u00a55-20 for a 20-pack. Popular national brands include Zhongnanhai (\u4e2d\u5357\u6d77 zh\u014dngn\u00e1nh\u01cei), Honghe (\u7ea2\u6cb3 h\u00f3ngh\u00e9), Baisha, Nanjing, Liqun, and Double Happiness (\u53cc\u559c shu\u0101ngx\u01d0). Some local brands sold in certain regions can be much cheaper whilst others are more expensive. Chinese cigarettes are stronger than many foreign cigarettes (13mg tar is the norm) although Zhongnanhai is popular with foreign visitors, having a similar taste to Marlboro Light but only half the price. Western brands are available including Marlboro (\u4e07\u5b9d\u8def w\u00e0nb\u01ceol\u00f9), 555 (\u4e09\u4e94 s\u0101n w\u01d4), Davidoff (\u5927\u536b\u675c\u592b d\u00e0w\u00e8id\u00f9f\u00fa), Kent, Salem and Parliament. Western cigarettes are a little more expensive - stick to major convenience store chains such as C-Store or Kedi as many smaller stores sell counterfeit or illegally imported cigarettes.\n</p><p>Premium-brand cigarettes are often ridiculously overpriced and are vary rarely smoked personally - they are usually offered as gifts or bribes as an expression of wealth. The two most famous 'premium brands' include Zhonghua (\u4e2d\u534e zh\u014dnghu\u00e1) (\u00a560-100) and Panda (\u00a5100). If you choose to buy them then stick to major department stores - those sold in neighbourhood cigarette stores are likely to be fake. Rolling tobacco and papers are rare in urban China. Lighters (\u6253\u706b\u673a d\u01cehu\u01d2j\u012b) are usually cheap (about \u00a51) but flimsily made. Zippos are widely available but expensive whilst counterfeits cheaper.\n</p><p>Cigars can be bought from some specialty tobacco stores and Chinese-made cigars can be good - expect to pay around &#165;20-30 for 10 locally produced cigars. Beware of counterfeit western-brand cigars sold in bar-districts; they are usually terrible and ridiculously overpriced. Genuine Cuban cigars are available in cigar bars and upscale establishments in large cities but are often very expensive (luxury goods are heavily taxed).\n</p><p>Duty-free stores in international airports, international rail stations (e.g. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou East) and at land borders sell a greater range of imported brands - expect to pay between &#165;80-150 for a 200-cigarette carton.\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eat\">Eat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=102\" title=\"Edit section: Eat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Eat\" title=\"click to add a eat listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '102', 'eat', 'China');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:242px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Chifan_De_Malu.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/9/9a/Chifan_De_Malu.jpeg/240px-Chifan_De_Malu.jpeg\" width=\"240\" height=\"151\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/9/9a/Chifan_De_Malu.jpeg/360px-Chifan_De_Malu.jpeg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/9/9a/Chifan_De_Malu.jpeg/480px-Chifan_De_Malu.jpeg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3072\" data-file-height=\"1928\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Chifan_De_Malu.jpeg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A food street in Jinan</div></div></div>\n<p>Food in China varies widely from region to region so the term \"Chinese food\" is pretty much a blanket term, just like \"Western food.\" While visiting, relax your inhibitions and try a bit of everything. Be aware that some \"Chinese\" food, such as Beef and Broccoli or Chow Mein should be avoided (if you could even find them), as these are not real Chinese dishes and will get you strange looks from locals.\n</p><p>Do keep in mind that undercooked food or poor hygiene can cause bacterial or parasitic infection, particularly during warm or hot weather.  Thus it is advisable to take great care about (and perhaps abstain from) eating seafood and meat on the street during the summer. In addition, unless you're in Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai or other large cities, raw meat and seafood should be avoided. That all being said, the hygiene conditions of a restaurant are usually satisfactory which means that diarrhea is usually not a risk to most people. \n</p><p>Chinese gourmands place emphasis on freshness so your meal will most likely be cooked as soon as you order it. Searing hot woks over coal or gas fires make even street food usually safe to eat. Indeed freshly prepared street food, as noted by many travel writers, is often safer than the food sitting on the buffet lines of 5-star hotels. China is no exception.\n</p><p>The two-menu system where different menus are presented according to the skin color of a guest remains largely unheard of in China. Most restaurants only have one menu - the Chinese one. Learning some Chinese characters such as beef (\u725b), pork (\u732a), chicken (\u9e21), fish (\u9c7c), stir-fried (\u7092), deep-fried (\u70b8), braised (\u70e7), baked or grilled (\u70e4), soup (\u6c64), rice (\u996d), or noodles (\u9762) will take you a long way. As pork is the most common meat in Chinese cuisine, where a dish simply lists \"meat\" (\u8089), assume it is pork.\n</p><p>Certain Chinese dishes contain ingredients some people may prefer to avoid, such as dog, snake or endangered species. However, it is <i>very unlikely</i> that you will order these dishes by a mistake. Dog and snake are usually served in specialty restaurants which do not hide their ingredients. Obviously, products made from endangered ingredients will have astronomical prices and would not be listed on the regular menu anyway.\n</p><p>Generally speaking, rice is the main staple in the south, while wheat, mostly in the form of noodles, is the main staple in the north.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regional_Cuisines\">Regional Cuisines</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=103\" title=\"Edit section: Regional Cuisines\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Four_Great_Traditions_.28.E5.9B.9B.E5.A4.A7.E8.8F.9C.E7.B3.BB.29\">Four Great Traditions (\u56db\u5927\u83dc\u7cfb)</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=104\" title=\"Edit section: Four Great Traditions (\u56db\u5927\u83dc\u7cfb)\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li> <b>Jiangsu / Zhejiang / Shanghai</b> (\u6dee\u626c\u83dc \"Hu\u00e1iy\u00e1ng c\u00e0i\", \u82cf\u83dc,\"S\u016b C\u00e0i\", Huaiyang cuisine): Huaiyang cuisine tends to have a sweet side to it and is almost never spicy. Pork, freshwater fish, and other aquatic creatures serve as the meat base in most dishes, which are usually more meticulous and light compared to the more \"brash\" eating styles of northern China. Huaiyang cuisine also includes several breakfast choices such as crab soup dumplings (\u87f9\u9ec4\u6c64\u5305 \"x\u00eceh\u00faang t\u0101ngb\u0101o\"), thousand-layered cake (\u5343\u5c42\u7cd5 \"qi\u0101nc\u00e9ng g\u0101o\"), steamed dumplings (\u84b8\u997a \"zh\u0113ngji\u01ceo\"), tofu noodles (\u5927\u716e\u5e72\u4e1d \"d\u00e0zh\u01d4 g\u0101ns\u012b\"), and wild vegetable steamed buns (\u83dc\u5305\u5b50 \"c\u00e0i b\u0101ozi\").</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Cantonese / Guangzhou / Hong Kong</b> (\u5e7f\u4e1c\u83dc <i>Gu\u01cengd\u014dng  C\u00e0i</i>, \u7ca4\u83dc <i>Yu\u00e8 C\u00e0i</i>): the style most Western visitors are already familiar with to some extent. Not too spicy, the emphasis is on freshly cooked ingredients and seafood. Dim Sum (\u70b9\u5fc3 <i>Di\u01cenx\u012bn</i>), small snacks usually eaten for breakfast or lunch, are a highlight.

Sichuanese food is widely available outside Sichuan and also native to Chongqing. If you want really authentic Sichuanese food outside Sichuan or Chongqing, look for small eateries sporting the characters for Sichuan cuisine in neighborhoods with lots of migrant workers.

According to legend, the smell was so good a monk forgot his vegetarian vows and leaped over the wall to have some.

Braising and stewing are common cooking techniques. Frying and stir frying are used much less frequently in Anhui cuisine than in other Chinese culinary traditions.Anhui cuisine consists of three styles: the Yangtze River region, Huai River region, and southern Anhui region.

The most famous dishes are <i>xiaolongbao</i> (\u5c0f\u7b3c\u5305 <i>Xi\u01ceol\u00f3ngb\u0101o</i>) and chives dumplings (\u97ed\u83dc\u997a\u5b50 <i>Ji\u01d4c\u00e0i Ji\u01ceozi </i>). Another specialty is \"pulled noodles\" (\u62c9\u9762 <i>l\u0101mi\u00e0n</i>), from which Japanese <i>ramen</i> and Korean <i>ramyeon</i> are believed to be derived.

Famous dishes include braised duck (\u5364\u9e2d <i>L\u01d4y\u0101</i>), yam paste dessert (\u828b\u6ce5 <i>Y\u00f9n\u00ed</i>) and fishballs (\u9c7c\u4e38 <i>Y\u00faw\u00e1n</i>).</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Guizhou</b> (\u8d35\u5dde\u83dc <i>Gu\u00eczh\u014du C\u00e0i</i>, \u9ed4\u83dc <i>Qi\u00e1n C\u00e0i</i>): combines elements of Sichuan and Xiang cuisine, making liberal use of spicy, peppery and sour flavors. The peculiar <i>zhergen</i> (\u6298\u8033\u6839 <i>Zh\u0113'\u011brg\u0113n</i>), a regional root vegetable, adds an unmistakable sour-peppery flavor to many dishes.

Street food and snacks sold from portable vendors can be found throughout China's cities. Wangfujing district's <i>Snack Street</i> in Beijing is a notable, if touristy, area for street food. In Cantonese-speaking areas, street food vendors are called <i>gai bin dong;</i> such ventures can grow into a substantial business with the stalls only barely 'mobile' in the traditional street food sense. Various quick eats available nationwide include:\n</p>\n<ul><li> Various, usually sweet, items from the ubiquitous bakeries (\u9762\u5305\u623f, \u9762\u5305\u5e97). A great variety of sweets and sweet food found in China are often sold as snacks, rather then as a post-meal dessert course in restaurants as in the West.</li>\n<li> Barbecued sticks of meat from street vendors. Yang rou chuan (\u7f8a\u8089\u4e32), or fiery Xinjiang-style lamb kebabs, are particularly renowned.</li>\n<li> Jiaozi (\u997a\u5b50), which Chinese translate as \"dumplings\", boiled, steamed or fried ravioli-like items with a variety of fillings. These are found throughout Asia; momos, mandu, gyoza, and jiaozi are all basically variations of the same thing.</li>\n<li> Baozi (\u5305\u5b50), steamed buns stuffed with savoury, sweet or vegetable fillings.</li>\n<li> Mantou (\u9992\u5934), steamed bread available on the roadside - great for a very cheap and filling snack.</li>\n<li> Lanzhou-style lamian (\u62c9\u9762), fresh hand-pulled noodles. This industry is heavily dominated by members of the Hui (\u56de\u65cf) ethnic group<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.chinatravel.com/facts/chinese-culture-and-history/chinese-ethnic-groups/hui-ethnic-minority/\">[42]</a> - look for a tiny restaurant with staff in Muslim dress, white fez-like hats on the men and head scarves on the women.</li>\n<li> In Guangdong and sometimes elsewhere, dim sum (\u70b9\u5fc3). At any major tourist destination in China, you may well find someone serving dim sum for Hong Kong customers.</li></ul>\n<p>The Western notion of fast food is arguably as popular as the domestic variety. KFC (\u80af\u5fb7\u57fa), McDonald's (\u9ea6\u5f53\u52b3), Subway (\u8d5b\u767e\u5473) and Pizza Hut (\u5fc5\u80dc\u5ba2) are ubiquitous, at least in mid-sized cities and above. Although common, the menus and flavors in these Western chains have been altered to suit Chinese tastes, such as Mcdonald's Red Bean Mcflurry. There are a few Burger Kings (\u6c49\u5821\u738b), Domino's and Papa John's (\u68d2\u7ea6\u7ff0) as well but only in major cities. Chinese chains are also widespread. These include Dicos (\u5fb7\u514b\u58eb) - chicken burgers, fries etc., cheaper than KFC and some say better - and Kung Fu (\u771f\u529f\u592b) - which has a more Chinese menu.\n</p><p>Another Western brand that takes on a surprising incarnation in China is H\u00e4agen-Dazs. If you see a H\u00e4agen-Dazs in a larger city like Shanghai or Guangzhou, note that it is in fact a formal dining experience, where an ice cream sundae will cost about 100 RMB. Also note that some other Western brands that are considered casual in the West may take on a more formal atmosphere in China. Pizza Hut is an example of this.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Etiquette\">Etiquette</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=108\" title=\"Edit section: Etiquette\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>China is the birthplace of chopsticks and unsurprisingly, much important etiquette relates to the use of chopsticks. While the Chinese are generally tolerant about table manners, you will most likely be seen as ill-mannered, annoying or offensive when using chopsticks in improper ways. Stick to the following rules: \n</p>\n<ul><li> Never use your chopsticks to examine a dish piece by piece, making everyone taste your saliva. Implicitly use your eye to target what you want, and pick it. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Once you pick a piece, you are obliged to take it. Don't put it back. Confucius says never leave someone what you don't want.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> When someone is picking from a dish, don't try to cross over or go underneath his arms to pick from a dish further away. Wait until they finish picking.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> In most cases, a dish is not supposed to be picked simultaneously by more than one person. Don't try to compete with anyone to pick a piece from the same dish. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Don't put your chopsticks vertically into your bowl of rice as it is reminiscent of incense sticks burning at the temple and carries the connotation of wishing death for those around you. Instead, place it across your bowl or on the chopstick rest, if provided.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Don't drum your bowl with chopsticks. Only beggars do it. People don't find it funny even if you're willing to satirically call yourself a beggar. </li></ul>\n<p>Other less important dining rules include:\n</p>\n<ul><li> Many travel books suggest that cleaning your plate suggests that your host did not to feed you well and will feel pressured to order more food. In general, finishing a meal involves a delicate balance. Cleaning your plate will typically invite more to be served, while leaving too much may be a sign that you didn't like it. When you're stuffed, you will please your host by lifting up a thumb, telling your host how much you enjoy it, and theatrically rubbing your belly to show that you're stuffed.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Communal chopsticks (\u516c\u7b77) are not always provided. Diners typically use their own chopsticks to transfer food to their bowl. While many Westerners consider this unhygienic, it is usually safe. However, if desired, it is acceptable to request communal utensils.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Making slurping noises when eating is common but could be considered inappropriate, especially among well educated families. However, slurping is seen by some gourmands as a way to enhance flavor.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Spoons are used when drinking soups or eating watery dishes such as porridge. In China, the dish should be scooped <i>towards</i> you, and not away from you as done in the West, as the Chinese believe that this rakes in wealth.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> If a piece is too slippery to pick, do it with the aid of a spoon; do not spear it with the sharp end of the chopstick.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> All dishes are shared, similar to \"family style\" dining in North America. When you order anything, it's not just for you, it's for everyone. You're expected to consult others before you order a dish. When you're asked about your opinion, being overly picky is usually seen as annoying.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> It is normal for your host or hostess to put food on your plate. It is a gesture of kindness and hospitality. If you wish to decline, do it in a way so that it does not offend. For example, you should insist that they eat and that you serve yourself.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Fish heads are considered a delicacy and may be offered to you as an honored guest. In truth, the cheek meat is particularly savory.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Treating\">Treating</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=109\" title=\"Edit section: Treating\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In China, restaurants and pubs are very common entertainment places and treating plays an important part in socializing. \n</p><p>While splitting the bill is beginning to be accepted by young people, treating is still the norm, especially when the parties are in obviously different social classes. Men are expected to treat women, elders to juniors, rich to poor, hosts to guests, working class to non-income class (students). Friends of the same class will usually prefer to split the opportunity to treat, rather than split the bill, i.e. \"This is my turn, and you treat next time.\" \n</p><p>It is common to see Chinese competing sweatily to pay the bill. You are expected to fight back and say \"It's my turn, you treat me next time.\" The smiling loser will accuse the winner of being too courteous. These dramas are becoming somewhat less common among young urban Chinese despite still being widespread among all generations and usually played wholeheartedly.\n</p><p>Unless you only hang out with non-Chinese tourists, you will have fair chances of being treated. For budget travelers, the good news is that Chinese tend to be eager to treat foreigners, although you shouldn't expect much from students and working class families and individuals. \n</p><p>That being said, Chinese tend to be very tolerant towards foreigners. If you feel like going dutch, try it. They tend to believe that \"all foreigners prefer to go dutch\". If they try to argue, it usually means that they insist on paying for your bill as well, not the opposite.\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drink\">Drink</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=110\" title=\"Edit section: Drink\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Drink\" title=\"click to add a drink listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '110', 'drink', 'China');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<p>The Chinese love a tipple and the all-purpose word <i>ji\u01d4</i> (\u9152) covers quite a range of alcoholic drinks.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Toasting\">Toasting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=111\" title=\"Edit section: Toasting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Chinese toast with the word <b>g\u0101nb\u0113i</b> (\u5e72\u676f, literally \"dry glass\"). Traditionally one is expected to drain the glass in one swig. During a meal, the visitor is generally expected to drink at least one glass with each person present; sometimes there may be <b>considerable</b> pressure to do this. And it can be considered rude, at least early during the meal, if you do not make a toast every time you take a drink.\n</p><p>Exercise caution. Fortunately, the glasses are usually small &#8212; even beer is often drunk from an oversized shot glass. The Chinese liquor, <i>baijiu</i>, is definitely potent (up to 65% alcohol). Baijiu is often drunk in small shot glasses for a good reason. US president Nixon practiced drinking before his first trip to China to be ready to drink with Mao Zedong. Unless you are used to imbibing heavily, be very careful when drinking with Chinese. \n</p><p>If you want to take it easy but still be sociable, say <b>su\u00edbi\u00e0n</b> (\u968f\u4fbf) before you make the toast, then drink only part of the glass.

The most famous brand is <b>Tsingtao</b> (\u9752\u5cf6) from Qingdao, which was at one point a German concession. Other brands abound and are generally light beers in a pilsner or lager style with 3-4% alcohol. In addition to national brands, most cities will have one or more cheap local beers. Some companies (Tsingtao, Yanjing) also make a dark beer (\u9ed1\u5564\u9152 <i>h\u0113ip\u00edji\u01d4</i>). In some regions, beers from other parts of Asia are fairly common and tend to be popular with travellers &#8212; Filipino San Miguel in Guangdong, Singaporean Tiger in Hainan, and Laotian Beer Lao in Yunnan, The typical price for beer is about \u00a52.5-4 in a grocery store, \u00a54-18 in a restaurant, around \u00a525 in an ordinary bar, and \u00a540+ in a fancier bar.\n</p><p>Most places outside of major cities serve beer at room temperature, regardless of season, though places that cater to American and Canadian tourists have it cold. \n</p><p>Locally made <b>grape wine</b> (\u8461\u8404\u9152 <i>p\u00fataoji\u01d4</i>) is common and much of it is reasonably priced, from \u00a515 in a grocery store, about \u00a5100-150 in a fancy bar.  That said, most of the stuff bears only the faintest resemblance to Western wines. The Chinese like their wines red and very, very sweet, and they're typically served over ice or mixed with Sprite.  Great Wall and Dynasty are large brands with a number of wines at various prices; their cheaper (under \u00a540) offerings are generally not impressive.

Most foreigners find <i>baijiu</i> tastes like diesel fuel, while a liquor connoisseur may find high quality, expensive <i>baijiu</i> quite good. <i>Baijiu</i> is definitely an acquired taste, but once the taste is acquired, it's quite fun to \"ganbei\" a glass or two at a banquet.\n</p><p>The cheapest <i>baijiu</i> is the Beijing brewed <b>\u00e8rgu\u014dt\u00f3u</b> (\u4e8c\u9505\u5934) (\u00a54.5 per 100 mL bottle).

Ordering \"xi\u01ceo \u00e8r\" (Erguotou's diminutive nickname) will likely raise a few eyebrows and a chuckle from working class Chinese. \n</p><p><b>M\u00e1ot\u00e1i</b> (\u8305\u53f0), made in Guizhou Province, is China's most famous brand of <i>baijiu</i> and China's national liquor. Made from sorghum, Maotai and its expensive cousins (such as Kaoliang in Taiwan) are well-known for their strong fragrance and are actually sweeter than western clear liquors as the sorghum taste is preserved - in a way.\n</p><p>Chinese <b>brandy</b> (\u767d\u5170\u5730) is excellent value, about the same price as grape wine or <i>baijiu</i>, and generally far more palatable than either. A \u00a516-20 local brandy is not a \u00a5200+ imported brand-name cognac, but it is close enough that you should only buy the cognac if money doesn't matter. Expats debate the relative merits of brandies from French-owned Louis Wann <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.louiswann.com/english/index_e.htm\">[44]</a>, Chinese brand Changyu <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.changyu.com.cn/english/homepage.asp\">[45]</a>, and several others. All are drinkable. \n</p><p>The Chinese are also great fans of various supposedly <b>medicinal liquors</b>, which usually contain exotic herbs and/or animal parts. Some of these have prices in the normal range and include ingredients like ginseng. These can be palatable enough, if tending toward sweetness. Others, with unusual ingredients (snakes, turtles, bees, etc.) and steep price tags, are probably best left to those that enjoy them.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Bars.2C_discos_and_karaoke\">Bars, discos and karaoke</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=113\" title=\"Edit section: Bars, discos and karaoke\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Western style pubs are becoming increasingly popular across the country. Especially in the more affluent urban centers such as Shenzhen, Shanghai, and Hangzhou one can find painstakingly recreated replicas of traditional Irish or English pubs. Like their Western counterparts most will have a selection of foreign beers on tap as well as provide pub food (of varying quality) and often feature live cover bands. Most of these pubs cater to and are frequented by the expatriate communities so you should not expect to find many Chinese in these places. Be aware that imported beer can be very expensive compared to local brew.\n</p><p>To just go out for a few drinks with friends, pick a local restaurant and drink beer at around \u00a55 for a 600 ml bottle. It will be Chinese lager, around 3% alcohol, with a limited choice of brand and may be served warm. Most mid- to high- range restaurants will have small private suites for gatherings (usually offered free if there is more than around 5 people), and the staff will generally not try to hustle you out even if you decide to stay until closing time. Many residents frequent outdoor restaurants or roadside stalls and barbecues (sh\u0101ok\u01ceo - \u70e7\u70e4) for a nice and inexpensive evening.\n</p><p>In <b>discos</b> and <b>fancy bars</b> with entertainment, you normally buy beer \u00a5100 at a time; this gets you anywhere from 4 import-brand beer (Heineken, Bud, Corona, Sol, ..) to 10 local beers. A few places offer cocktails; fewer have good ones.\n</p><p>Other drinks are sold only by the bottle, not by the glass. Red wine is in the \u00a580-200 range (served with ice and Sprite) and mediocre imported whiskeys (Chivas, Johnny Walker, Jim Beam, Jack Daniels; extremely rarely single malts) and cognacs, \u00a5300-800. Both are often mixed with sweet bottled green or red tea. Vodka, tequila and rum are less common, but sometimes available. Bogus \"brand name\" products are fairly common and may ruin your next day.\n</p><p>These places often have <b>bar girls</b>, young women who drink a lot and want to play drinking games to get you to consume more. They get a commission on whatever you buy. In general, these girls will not leave the bar with you; they are professional flirts, not prostitutes.\n</p><p><b>Karaoke</b> (\u5361\u62c9OK) is huge in China and can be broadly split into two categories. More common is the no-frills karaoke box or <b>KTV</b>, where you rent a room, bring your friends and the house gives you a mike and sells you booze. Much favored by students, these are cheap and fun with the right crowd, although you need at least a few people for a memorable night. Bringing your own booze can keep the price tag down but must be done on the sly - many places have windows in the door so the staff can make sure you only drink liquor they sold to you.\n</p><p>Rather different is the distinctly dodgier <b>special KTV</b> lounge, more oriented to businessmen entertaining clients or letting their hair down, where the house provides anything and everything at a price. At these often opulent establishments &#8212; over-the-top Roman and Egyptian themes are standard &#8212; you'll be joined by short-skirted professional karaoke girls, who charge by the hour for the pleasure of their company and whose services may not be limited to just singing badly and pouring your drinks. It's highly advisable not to venture into these unless you're absolutely sure somebody else is footing the bill, which can easily run into hundreds of dollars even if you keep your pants on.\n</p><p>As elsewhere, never <b>never</b> accept an invitation to a restaurant or bar from an available-looking woman who just picked you up in the street sometime after sundown. At best, suggest a different place. If she refuses, drop her on the spot. More than likely, she will steer you into a quiet little place with too many doormen and you will find yourself saddled with a modest meal and beer that will cost you \u00a51,000 or worse. And the doormen won't let you leave till you pay up. This is somewhat rare. But it does happen.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Tea\">Tea</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=114\" title=\"Edit section: Tea\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>China is the birthplace of tea, and at the risk of stating the obvious, there's a lot of <b>tea</b> (\u8336 <i>ch\u00e1</i>) in China. Green tea (\u7eff\u8336 <i>l\u01dcch\u00e1</i>) is served up for free in some restaurants (depending on region) or for a small fee. The most common types served are:\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>gunpowder tea</b> (\u73e0\u8336 <i>zh\u016bch\u00e1</i>): a green tea so-named not after the taste but after the appearance of the bunched-up leaves used to brew it (the Chinese name \"pearl tea\" is rather more poetic)</li>\n<li> <b>jasmine tea</b> (\u8309\u8389\u82b1\u8336 <i>m\u00f2lihuach\u00e1</i>): green-tea scented with jasmine flowers</li>\n<li> <b>oolong</b> (\u70cf\u9f8d <i>w\u016bl\u00f3ng</i>): a half-fermented mountain tea.</li></ul>\n<p>However, specialist tea houses serve a vast variety of brews, ranging from the pale, delicate white tea (\u767d\u8336 <i>b\u00e1ich\u00e1</i>) to the powerful fermented and aged pu'er tea (\u666e\u6d31\u8336 p\u01d4'\u011brch\u00e1). Tea in Chinese culture is akin to wine in Western culture, and even the same type of tea will come in many different grades. Always check prices carefully before ordering as some of the best varieties can be very pricey indeed. Most tea shops have some teas at several hundred yuan per jing (500 g) and prices up to \u00a52,000 are not uncommon. The record price for top grade tea sold at auction was well over \u00a57000 a <i>gram</i>.\n</p><p>Various areas of China have famous teas. Hangzhou, near Shanghai, is famed for its \"Dragon Well\" (\u9f99\u4e95 <i>l\u00f3ngj\u01d0ng</i>)  green tea. <a href=\"/en/Fujian\" title=\"Fujian\">Fujian</a> has the most famous oolong teas, \"Big Red Robe\" (\u5927\u7ea2\u888d <i>d\u00e0h\u00f3ngp\u00e1o</i>) from <a href=\"/en/Mount_Wuyi\" title=\"Mount Wuyi\">Mount Wuyi</a> and \"Iron Goddess of Mercy\" (\u94c1\u89c2\u97f3 <i>ti\u011bgu\u0101ny\u012bn</i>) from <a href=\"/en/Anxi\" title=\"Anxi\">Anxi</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=P%C7%94%27%C4%9Br&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"P\u01d4&#39;\u011br (page does not exist)\">P\u01d4'\u011br</a> in Yunnan has the most famous fully fermented tea, <i>p\u01d4'\u011brch\u00e1</i> (\u666e\u6d31\u8336). This comes compressed into hard cakes, originally a packing method for transport by horse caravan to Burma and Tibet. The cakes are embossed with patterns; some people hang them up as wall decorations.\n</p><p>Most tea shops will be more than happy to let you sit down and try different varieties of tea. \"Ten Fu Tea\" is a national chain and in Beijing \"Wu Yu Tai\" is the one some locals say they favor.\n</p><p>Black tea, the type of tea most common in the West, is known in China as \"red tea\" (\u7d05\u8336 <i>h\u00f3ngch\u00e1</i>). While almost all Western teas are black teas, the converse isn't true, with many Chinese teas, including the famed P\u01d4'\u011br also falling into the \"black tea\" category.\n</p><p>Normal Chinese teas are always drunk neat, with the use of sugar or milk unknown. However, in some areas you will find Hong Kong style \"milk tea\" (\u5976\u8336 <i>n\u01ceich\u00e1</i>) or Tibetan \"butter tea\".  Taiwanese bubble tea (\u73cd\u73e0\u5976\u8336 <i>Zh\u0113nzh\u016b N\u01ceich\u00e1</i>) is also popular and widely available.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Coffee\">Coffee</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=115\" title=\"Edit section: Coffee\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Coffee (\u5496\u5561 <i>k\u0101f\u0113i</i>) is becoming quite popular in urban China, though it is nearly impossible to find in smaller towns.\n</p><p>Several chains of coffee shops have branches in many cities, including Starbucks (\u661f\u5df4\u514b), UBC Coffee (\u4e0a\u5c9b\u5496\u5561), Ming Tien Coffee Language and SPR .

Go to a Western fast food chain (KFC, McD, etc.) for some \u00a58 coffee.

Ask for beer or soda in a restaurant, and it may arrive at room temperature, though beer is more commonly served cold, at least in the summer. Water will generally be served hot. That is actually good, because only boiled (or bottled) water is safe to drink, but it's not pleasant to drink hot water in the summer. \n</p><p>You can get cold drinks from small \"convenience\" stores and restaurants, just look for the cooler (even though it might not actually be cool). You can try bringing a cold beverage into a restaurant. Most small restaurants won't mind--if they even notice--and there is no such thing as a \"cork\" charge in China (there actually is cork charge in most high-end restaurants but generally it does not apply to foreigners due to language barrier). Remember that most people will be drinking tea, which is free anyway (not always though), so the restaurant is probably not expecting to profit on your beverage consumption (again, it's actually a matter of language barrier because most foreigners simply do not know what to order to drink in China; in fact most restaurants make huge profit on beverage consumption).\n</p><p>Asking for ice is best avoided. Many, perhaps most, places just don't have it. The ice they do have may well be made from unfiltered tap water and arguably unsafe for travelers sweating bullets about diarrhea.\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sleep\">Sleep</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=117\" title=\"Edit section: Sleep\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Sleep\" title=\"click to add a sleep listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '117', 'sleep', 'China');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<div style=\"display: table; border-radius: 6px; background-color: #fff3f3; border: 1px solid #a00; margin: 0.5em 1em 0 1em; padding: 6px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #aaa;\" class=\"pp_warningbox\">\n<table>\n\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n<td style=\"width: 56px;\"><img alt=\"Travel Warning\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ambox_warning_pn.svg/50px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png\" title=\"Travel Warning\" width=\"50\" height=\"43\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ambox_warning_pn.svg/75px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ambox_warning_pn.svg/100px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"445\" />\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"font-size: 130%; color: #a00\"><b>WARNING:</b></span> Foreigners MUST present an original passport with a valid visa for checking in a legal hotel or hostel.\n<p>Many wikitravellers have reported troubles during check-in when their passports were held by other consulates or Public Security Bureau(PBS) office for applying or extending a visa. Without an original passport, you will be refused to check in under any circumstances. Presenting a receipt from the police or consulates to prove the whereabout of your passport will NOT help. Therefore, before applying a new visa, travellers should stay at the same hotels/hostels and not move until getting their passport(s) back.\n</p><p>Hotels in China are subject to a tough control of PSB, which strictly requires all legal hotel and hostels to register guests' passports and visa information. A hotel that fails to comply may be suspended and the relevant staff could be jailed.\n</p><p>As of July 2018, the China government does not have a policy to help those who have lost their passports to check in.

There are plenty of \"homestay\" (\u5bb6\u5ead\u65c5\u9986, jiating lvguan\uff09which are illegal accommodations located somewhere in a residential building. These types of accommodations are subject to frequent crackdowns. Be aware that they can also be a magnet of unemployed, criminals and those who overstay with their visas.

In certain areas, foreign tourists are only allowed to stay at several approved  hotels. although this is slowly changing. Some cheap establishments are still locally state-run affairs and haven't changed much since the Maoist era. Other ultra-cheap options are used as temporary housing by migrant workers and would not appeal to most travelers for security and cleanliness reasons. That said, there's a dizzying number of sleeping options in most Chinese towns, and despite language and legal barriers you should be able to find something in your budget and comfort range.\n</p><p>Finding a hotel when first arriving in a Chinese city can be a daunting task: a mob of passengers is pushing to disembark from the train or bus, touts are tugging at your arm and screaming in your face to go with them, everything is in incomprehensible Chinese and you are just looking for a place to put down your bag. It doesn't get any better once you get in a cab because the driver doesn't speak any English and every hotel in your guide book is full or closed! This can be the experience for many travelers in China, but the pains of finding a hotel room can be avoided if you know where to look and what you're looking for. In addition, star ratings especially for two and three-star hotels generally cannot be trusted in China. Pricing is a much better guide.\n</p><p>If you're willing to pay \u00a5200 or more for a room, then you'll probably have little problem finding a room. But if you want something cheaper yet still comfortable, you'll need more information than many guide books provide. The cheapest options include <b><a href=\"/en/Hostels\" title=\"Hostels\">hostels</a></b>, <b>dorms</b>, and extra rooms called <b>zhusu</b>. Every city has plenty of hotels charging \u00a5150 and up. <b>Sleeper trains</b> and <b>sleeper buses</b> can also be a decent option if you schedule your long-distance travel overnight (see the <a href=\"#Get_around\">Get around</a> section of this page for more information). If you're in a town and you can't find a hotel, try looking near the bus or train station, an area that typically has a larger selection of cheap hotels. Hotels that are not licensed to accept foreigners can be heavily fined if they are caught housing foreign occupants, but enforcement of this law appears spotty and many unlicensed hotels will find you a room anyway.\n</p><p>In the cheapest range of hotels it is important to ask if hot water is available 24 hours-a-day (\u6709\u6ca1\u6709\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u4e2a\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u70ed\u6c34 <i>y\u01d2um\u00e9iy\u01d2u \u00e8rshis\u00ec ge xi\u01ceosh\u00ed de r\u00e8shu\u01d0</i>), and check if the shower, sink and toilet actually work. It is also advisable to avoid checking into a room next to a busy street as traffic may keep you up late and wake you up early. If you do plan on just showing up in town and looking for a place to sleep, it's best to arrive before 6PM-7PM. or the most popular places will be booked for the night.\n</p><p>Note that if you are absolutely at a loss for finding housing, you should seek out the local police (\u8b66\u5bdf) or Public Security Bureau (\u516c\u5b89\u5c40). They can help you find a place to crash - at least for one night.\n</p><p><b>Prices are often negotiable,</b> and a sharp reduction from the price listed on the wall can often be had, even in nicer hotels, by simpy asking \"what's the lowest price?\" (\u6700\u4f4e\u591a\u5c11 <i>zu\u00ecd\u012b du\u014dsh\u01ceo</i>). When staying for more than a few days it is also usually possible to negotiate a lower daily rate. However, these negotiating tactics won't work during the busy Chinese holiday seasons when prices sky-rocket and rooms are hard to get. Many hotels, both chains and individual establishments, have membership cards offering discounts to frequent guests.\n</p><p>In mid-range and above hotels, it is common for guests to receive phone calls offering \"massage\" services; this is actually a thinly-veiled front for prostitution.\n</p><p><b>Booking a room over the Internet</b> with a credit card can be a convenient and speedy method of making sure you have a room when you arrive at your destination, and there are numerous websites that cater for this. Credit cards are not widely used in China, particularly in smaller and cheaper hotels. Such hotels usually ask to be paid in cash, with a security deposit, up front. Some new online services <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.dajiudian.info\">[46]</a> allow you to book without a credit card and pay cash at the hotel. During Chinese holidays, when it is difficult to get a room anywhere, this may be an acceptable option, but in the off-season rooms are plentiful almost everywhere and it may be just as easy to find a room upon arrival as it is to book one over the Internet.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Low-cost_Housing\">Low-cost Housing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=118\" title=\"Edit section: Low-cost Housing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are various ways to sleep very cheaply in China: hostels, dorms, zhusu, massage shops, saunas, and spas.\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>Hostels (\u9752\u5e74\u65c5\u793e)</b> are, by far, the most comfortable low-cost options. They typically cater to foreigners, have English speaking employees, and can provide cheap, convenient transport around town. Some of them are even cleaner and better furnished than more expensive places. Hostels also have a cozy, international atmosphere and are a good place to meet other travelers and get some half-decent Western food, which can be a godsend after days or weeks surviving off rice and noodles. In most cities of any size there is at least one hostel available, and in travel hot spots such as Beijing, <a href=\"/en/Yangshuo\" title=\"Yangshuo\">Yangshuo</a>, Dali, and Chengdu there are plenty of hostel options, although they can still fill up quickly because of their popularity with backpackers. Hostels can often be booked on-line in advance although you definitely should bring a print out of your confirmation as not all hostels are aware you can book their rooms (and pay a portion of the cost) on-line in advance. In Beijing, many hostels are located in <b>Hutongs</b> - traditional courtyard homes in the midst of a maze of traditional streets and architecture. While many of Beijing's Hutongs have been demolished a movement to save those which remain has led to a boom in youth hostels for backpackers and boutique hotels for the mid-range traveler.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Dorm rooms (\u5bbf\u820d)</b> are located on university campuses, near rural tourist attractions and as part of some hotels. Most travelers have spotty luck with dorms. It is not unusual to have rowdy or intoxicated roommates, and shared bathrooms can take some getting used to, especially if you're not used to traditional squat toilets or taking cold showers. However in some areas, especially on top of some of China's holy mountains, dorm rooms might be the only budget option in a sea of luxury resorts. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Zh\u00f9s\u00f9 (\u4f4f\u5bbf)</b>, which simply translates as \"accommodation\", can refer to any kind of sleeping accommodation, but those places that have the Chinese characters for zhusu written on the wall outside are the cheapest. A zhusu is not an actual hotel, but simply rooms for rent located in homes, restaurants, and near train and bus stations. Zhusu rooms are universally spartan and bathrooms are almost always shared. The price can be quite low, costing only a few dozen renminbi. Officially a zhusu should not provide a room to a foreigner, but many times the caretaker is eager to get a client and will be willing to rent to anyone. There are never any English signs advertising a zhusu, so if you can't read Chinese you may have to print out the characters for your hunt. Security in zhusu's is sketchy, so this option is not recommended if you have valuables with you.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Massage shops, saunas, and spas</b>: spa costs vary but can be as low as \u00a525. Entering a spa very late at night (after 1AM) and leaving before noon may get you a 50% discount. When in the spa there are beds or reclining couches in addition to showers, saunas etc. Admission to a spa is typically for 24 hours, and a small locker is provided for bags and personal possessions. This is ideal if you are traveling light. Furthermore spas often provide complimentary food, and paid services such as massages and body scrubbing. There is no privacy because usually everyone sleeps in one room. However, there is more security than in a dorm, since there are attendants who watch over the area, and your belongings (even your clothes!) are stored away in the lockers. Don't be fooled when receptionists try to make up reasons why you have to pay more than the listed rate. They may try to convince you that the listed rates are only for members, locals, women, men, or include only one part of the spa (i.e. shower, but no bed/couch). To verify any claims, strike up a conversation with a local a good distance away from the spa and inquire about the prices. Don't let them know that you are checking the spa's claims. Just act as if you are thinking about going there if the price is good. If they know that the spa is trying to overcharge you, they will typically support the spa's claim.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Budget_Hotels\">Budget Hotels</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=119\" title=\"Edit section: Budget Hotels\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The next level of hotels, which cater to Chinese clients, are usually officially off-limits to foreigners but you may be able to convince them to accept you, especially if you can speak a smattering of Chinese. The cheapest range of Chinese budget hotels (one step above the zhusu) are called <b>zh\u0101od\u00e0isu\u01d2</b> (\u62db\u5f85\u6240). Unlike zhusu these are <b>licensed</b> accommodations but are similarly spartan and utilitarian, often with shared bathrooms. Slightly more luxurious budget hotels and Chinese business hotels may or may not have English signs and usually have the words <b>l\u01dagu\u01cen</b> (\u65c5\u9986, meaning \"travel hotel\"), <b>b\u012bngu\u01cen</b> or <b>ji\u01d4di\u00e0n</b> (\u5bbe\u9986 and \u9152\u5e97, respectively, meaning \"hotel\") in their name. Room options typically include singles and doubles with attached bathrooms, and dorms with shared baths. Some budget hotels include complementary toiletries and Internet. In small, rural towns a night's stay might be as cheap as \u00a525; in bigger cities you can usually get a room for \u00a580-120. One problem with such hotels is that they can be quite noisy as patrons and staff may be yelling to each other across the halls into the wee hours of the morning. Another potential inconvenience is booking a room with a shared bath as many of these hotels have one bathroom for twenty or thirty rooms. You may have to wait a while to use the toilet and half an hour or more to take a shower. In smaller budget hotels the family running the place may simply lock up late at night when it appears no more customers are coming.

There are suites in Shanghai, for example, for over \u00a510,000 a night.  Many of these establishments cater to traveling business-types with expense accounts and charge accordingly for food and amenities (i.e. \u00a520 for a bottle of water which costs \u00a52 at a convenience store). Internet (wired or wireless) which is usually free in mid-range accommodations is often a pay service in high-end hotels. Some hotels in the \u00a5400-700 range such as Ramada or Days Inn are willing to lower their prices when business is slow. Chinese three and four-star hotels will often give block pricing or better deals if you negotiate or book a room for more than 5 days.

China's universities offer many different types of courses and teaching methods to cater to these needs as well as to the different educational levels of the students that come from abroad. <b>Peking University</b> (\u5317\u4eac\u5927\u5b66) and <b>Tsinghua University</b> (\u6e05\u534e\u5927\u5b66), both based in Beijing, are China's most prestigious universities, and are regularly ranked among the top universities in the world.\n</p><p><b>Language trainees</b> \nUniversities accept students who have achieved the minimum of a high school education for courses in the Chinese language. These courses usually last 1 or 2 years. Students are given certificates after they complete their course. Students who do not speak Chinese and want to study further in China are usually required to complete a language training course. \n</p><p>Private language schools also offer more flexible language training courses to get prepared to study, live or work in China. <span class='vcard' id = 'Mandarin_House'><span class=\"fn org\">Mandarin House</span> (<span class=\"nickname\"><span class=\"non-latin\">\u7f8e\u548c\u6c49\u8bed</span></span>), <a class=\"url external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.mandarinhouse.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">[5]</a>. <span class=\"description\"> was established in 2004 and is a well known Chinese school offering intensive group courses or tailor-made private tutoring lessons.

Some universities offer courses taught in foreign languages, but most courses are in Chinese, and you need to demonstrate a sufficient proficiency in Chinese before you can enroll. You do this by passing the <b>HSK test</b> (\u6c49\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u8003\u8bd5 <i>h\u00e0ny\u01d4 shu\u01d0p\u00edng k\u01ceosh\u00ec</i>), the official way to certify your skills on a Basic, Intermediate or Advanced level. The test involves reading, writing and listening, but no speaking.

Partial scholarships will cover the tuition fees of the study of your choice. Full scholarships cover pretty much everything, including books, rent, some medical coverage, and a monthly allowance for food and expenses. Although studying pins you down to a specific city and limits the time you can spend travelling, a scholarship is a great way to help you cut through some red tape, get a Residence Permit, and, if you're lucky, live in China practically for free.\n</p><p>To inquire about scholarships, you can directly contact the embassy in your area, or ask around at universities and language schools that have China-related courses. Scholarships are pre-distributed by quota to every country, so if too many people want one, you will be competing against your fellow citizens, not against the entire world. The procedure varies from country to country, but normally requires the following paperwork&#160;:\n</p>\n<ul><li> authorized copies of your highest (preferably university) degree, including the exam scores;</li>\n<li> two letters of recommendation</li>\n<li> proof of a full health check-up (blood-test, ECG, X-Ray, ...)</li>\n<li> a motivation</li>\n<li> plenty of passport-sized photos</li></ul>\n<p>All of this is shipped by the embassy to Beijing, which then decides who is accepted, where, and under what modalities. Application usually rounds up by the end of march, and the answer may not come until as late as august, with classes starting in September.\n</p><p>If all goes well, this will net you a letter of acceptance by the university of your choice, plus a visa that lets you stay in China for about two months. Once in China, you will have to do the medical tests all over again, and upgrade the visa to a residence permit. This however is where being part of a university comes in handy, as they should be able to handle all of the paperwork, going so far as to bring a medical team on campus to check you up &#8212; much preferable over you running from police station to hospital to consulate, especially if you don't speak Chinese!\n</p><p>When all is said and done, you will have a residence permit that lets you stay one year in China, lets you leave and enter the country as you want, and a fair ability to travel during weekends, holidays, and the occasional class-skipping stint.\n</p><p>For more information, visit the China Scholarship Council <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.csc.edu.cn/en/\">[52]</a> and China Service Center for Scholarly Exchanges <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.cscse.edu.cn\">[53]</a> websites.\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Work\">Work</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=124\" title=\"Edit section: Work\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<p>Teaching a language, most commonly English, is a very popular source of employment for foreigners. There are <a href=\"/en/Teaching_English\" title=\"Teaching English\">English-teaching</a> jobs all over China. The market for teachers of other languages is more limited. However most universities require all English majors to study another foreign language as well, and there are specialised universities for foreign languages in major cities such as Beijing <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.bfsu.edu.cn\">[54]</a>, Guangzhou <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://english.gwnews.net/\">[55]</a>, Xi'an <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.xisu.edu.cn/waiyuan/12.htm\">[56]</a>, Dalian and Shanghai <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.shisu.edu.cn/SISUenglish/\">[57]</a> which teach most major world languages. Guangzhou is establishing itself a reputation as a hub for so-called <i>rare</i> languages.\n</p><p>Requirements and qualifications range from just having a pulse and speaking a bit of English up to needing an MA and experience. Typically the good jobs want at least one, preferably two or three, of:\n</p>\n<ul><li> a 4-year degree</li>\n<li> a teaching certificate for primary school or high school from your own country</li>\n<li> a recognised TEFL certificate, e.g. Cambridge CELTA <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.cambridgeesol.org/teaching/celta.htm\">[58]</a></li>\n<li> teaching experience</li></ul>\n<p>If you want to go and do not already have good qualifications, get a TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certificate. It really helps.\n</p><p>There are a fairly strong preferences for native English speakers and for citizens of major English-speaking countries. Job ads routinely include a list of acceptable passports; UK, US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are on every list, Ireland and South Africa on most. Some schools will not even read the rest of your resume if you do not have one of those passports. Various prejudices may also come into play; overseas Chinese (even with perfect English), Filipinos, Indians, Malaysians, American Blacks, and especially Africans all report some difficulties finding jobs, or getting lower offers. Members of all those groups are happily employed in other schools, and many are well-paid, but getting a job is easier for people who fit a stereotype &#8212; Caucasians especially Americans or British. Some schools want blue-eyed blondes, because they hope that will help their marketing. Accent can also be an issue; Chinese people generally hope to acquire American accents, so a really thick Scots or Aussie accent will bother some employers, for example.\n</p><p>Pay and conditions vary greatly depending on location, experience and qualifications. Free accommodation, provided by the institution, is common. Generally this means an apartment of your own, though some tightfisted schools want teachers to share. Most jobs pay for all or part of an annual trip home. Teachers nearly always make enough to live well in China, though some have a problem in summer because many university or high school jobs pay for only the 10 months of the academic year. It is often possible to teach private lessons on the side - in fact your students or their parents may ask about this incessantly. Foreign teachers generally earn two or three times their Chinese colleagues' salaries but the differences are gradually narrowing. A public college or university will often pay less than a private school, but will also require fewer teaching hours.\n</p><p>Make <b>certain</b> you understand your employer's policies on outside work as some are quite restrictive. The standard government-provided contract<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.china-tesol.com/SAFEA_Contract/safea_contract.html\">[59]</a>, which most schools use (perhaps amended a bit), prohibits it enitirely unless you get permission from the employer. \n</p><p>If you plan to work as a teacher in China, research <i>very</i> carefully. You might get your dream job or a nightmare. Take great care in your selection of employer; broken contracts and general unscrupulousness and dishonesty are common. As a rule, government schools give the best all-around deals and if there is any dispute, you can appeal to the Foreign Experts Office of the provincial education ministry. If you can document your case and it is a valid one, they will take action. And it tends to be fast. Before filing an appeal, try to resolve the issue through direct discussion. If that fails, ask someone to function as a go-between -- a Chinese if possible, but otherwise another expatriate will do. Only appeal as a last resort: as in other aspects of life everywhere, the threat of action is often more effective than action itself.\n</p><p>When looking for a teaching job in China it's generally a good idea to apply through a reputable recruiter and ask them about the schools, the contracts, the work, the hours, the pay and anything that may be a cause for concern. With the size of the Chinese ESL market exploding, there are many private academies sprouting up and many unscrupulous businessmen trying to make a buck. Be careful, and let the recruiter do the work of screening an employer for you.\n</p><p>Recruitment services are completely free of charge for teachers. The fee is covered by the schools or the language centers. \n</p><p>See also <a href=\"/en/Teaching_English\" title=\"Teaching English\">Teaching English</a>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Work_visas\">Work visas</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=125\" title=\"Edit section: Work visas\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>To work as a teacher in China you need either a Foreign Teacher's Certificate (FTC) or a Foreign Expert's Certificate (FEC). Both are issued by the State Administration for Foreign Experts Affairs (SAFEA) <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.safea.gov.cn/english/\">[60]</a>. In theory, the FTC is for elementary or high school teachers and the FEC is for tertiary education. In practice, everyone seems to get the FEC. In theory, both require a degree; this is usually, but not always, enforced. Whether it is depends at least on where you are, how well-connected your school is, and how much trouble they are willing to go to. If you lack a degree, it helps if you have other certifications or diplomas.\n</p><p>Once you have the FEC, getting a Residence Permit is routine. The Residence Permit is generally good for a year and it acts as a multiple entry visa; you can leave China and return with no problem.\n</p><p>There can be difficulties. Universities and other public institutions can easily get Foreign Expert Certificates for staff, but not all private schools can. Before they can even apply for certificates, they must be authorized to employ foreigners by SAFEA. Getting the authorization takes many months and a significant amount of money. They also have to comply with SAFEA standards such as providing housing, health insurance and annual air fare home for all staff. Large established schools have the permission, but many of the smaller ones don't want the expense, so all their teachers are illegal. Some lie to teachers about this.\n</p><p>People over 60 often have trouble getting visas because of their age, and some job ads specify an age range. There are conflicting reports on whether this is SAFEA policy, SAFEA advice to provincial departments that make their own policies, or a question of health insurance. There are some exceptions, including a few people in their seventies still working legally.\n</p><p>The Foreign Expert's Certificate may get you a teacher's discount on some products and services including domestic flights.\n</p><p>Much the safest way to come to a job in China is to enter the country on a Z visa. There can be some confusion with the terms; a few years ago, the Z was a one-year working visa but now the Residence Permit is the long-term visa and the Z is just an entry visa good for 30 days, long enough to get the FEC and Residence Permit. The Z visa can only be obtained outside of China, and it requires a letter from the employers to accompany your passport when you apply. Generally the school will request a signed contract, a health certificate from a health professional, a copy of your passport details, and a copy of your diploma.  If you are over 60 and they are asking for their provincial office to accept you, they may also require that you have your own health insurance.\n</p><p>It used to be common for people already in China to go to Hong Kong or Macau for the Z visa. Around the time of the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the rules tightened up considerably; they have relaxed some since, but not entirely. This is also true for getting Chinese visas in other nearby countries such as Vietnam, Korea, Japan or Singapore. Some people have been told they must return to their home countries to obtain a Z visa. Others have been able to get a Z in Hong Kong, provided the invitation paperwork clearly stipulates it.\n</p><p>Some employers ask teachers to come in with a tourist visa, and say they can get a residence permit from that. The official regulations require the Z but moving from a tourist visa to Residence Permit is sometimes possible, depending on policies at the local PSB (Public Securty Bureau, the cops) office and the employer's contacts there. On the other hand, working on a tourist visa is illegal and some of the employers who want you to come on one are stringing you along; they do not have SAFEA permission to hire foreigners legally and are trying to wriggle around that. Do not even consider taking a post anywhere that wants you to come on a tourist visa unless you have talked to current foreign teachers already there and been assured that they came that way and had no problem getting FEC and Residence Permit.\n</p><p>If you complete your health certificate in your home country, be sure to get copies of the x-ray, lab reports and other machine documents.  Also have the form stamped with the official seal of the hospital.  Even though you do all of this you may\uff0cand most likely will, be required to take another physical in China.  Request before coming to China that if the physical is required inside of China after you arrive, that the school pay for the service.  The physical is usually very quick: EKG, chest x-ray, sonogram of heart and stomach area, blood test, and urine check.  However, the time of completion and various tests may change depending on the province.\n</p><p>An appearance at the local PSB is required to get your residency permit.  Again, negotiate with the school for them to pay for the permit prior to your leaving for China. Children and spouse going with you may require an even higher amount for their residency permit.\n</p><p>Schools range from completely reliable to crooks who leave foreigners stranded without a legitimate work visa after they arrive. It is <b>illegal</b> to work with a tourist visa, but some schools want teachers to do that, and some even want you to foot the bill for \"visa runs\" to Hong Kong to renew it, although with restrictions on renewals this has become more difficult. Be sure to speak with current or former teachers from the school before you sign up. If the school won't put you in touch with them, or if current teachers don't have Foreign Experts Certificates, don't go near the place.\n</p><p>There are 2 options for applying for a position in a Chinese schools. You can do so directly or through an agency. Generally, pay is higher going direct but requires negotiating experience with the school and trust that they will honour the conditions set out in the contract. Consequently, it is advisable that going direct should be preferable to experienced teachers with experience of life in China and dealing with employers. Using an agency employs the agency to negotiate the best positions on your behalf. However, the agency is only as good as the agency its self and not all agencies are reliable. It is therefore advisable to new teachers to use a reputable UK agency based in the Uk/US that is accountable under Western employment laws and standards and can be thoroughly researched before choosing an agency. &lt;ref&gt;<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.nooneliterecruitment.com/teach-english-in-china/\">https://www.nooneliterecruitment.com/teach-english-in-china/</a>&lt;/ref&gt;.\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_safe\">Stay safe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=126\" title=\"Edit section: Stay safe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crime\">Crime</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=127\" title=\"Edit section: Crime\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:CCTV_in_GDZQZX.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/CCTV_in_GDZQZX.jpg/250px-CCTV_in_GDZQZX.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/CCTV_in_GDZQZX.jpg/375px-CCTV_in_GDZQZX.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/CCTV_in_GDZQZX.jpg/500px-CCTV_in_GDZQZX.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3264\" data-file-height=\"2448\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:CCTV_in_GDZQZX.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>CCTV cameras are a very common sight across Mainland China.</div></div></div>\n<p>China is a huge country that shows a big regional difference over crime rates. \n</p><p>Most of the major cities in China are extremely safe. Violent crime remains rare and it is generally safe for even women at night. There is some scam, such as teahouse scam, and petty crimes can happen especially at the transportation hub and crowded area. \n</p><p>Some petty crimes such as bicycle theft and pickpocket are known. For bicycle riders, follow what local people do. If you see bikes are parked anywhere, just tie yours to a pole. It is common to park a bike without securing it to any fixed object, instead only locking the wheel. In a place where everyone takes their bikes inside restaurants or internet cafes, it's a warning sign. Bike parking is common outside supermarkets or shopping centers, and usually charges RMB1 to 2 per day (usually until 8-10pm). If you have an electric bicycle or scooter, pay extra caution as the battery-packs may be targeted.\n</p><p>On long journey buses especially departing from Shenzhen, passengers are required to take a mug shot before boarding.

Around Tiananmen Square and Wangfujing in Beijing and the Bund, People's Square, and Nanjing Road in Shanghai, scam artists stroll up to foreigners and attempt to start a conversation in English. They sometimes help you bargain and show you around. Everything is fine until they invite you to go to a teahouse, cafe or pub. Every item you consume there including each cup of tea, each biscuit or slice of fruit is priced at an extortionate rate. In some cases scam artists may ask to split the really high bill and convince the victim to pay at least half of it. A variant of this scam may happen when you are invited by \"art students\" to shabby art shops and pressured to buy overpriced reproductions.\n</p><p>Having said that, in real life, it is very common for curious Chinese to genuinely start a conversation with you, show you around, invite you for a drink and a meal. If you are paranoid about all invitations and interactions with the Chinese, it will ruin your travel experience. \n</p><p>Remember the following tips: \n</p>\n<ol><li>If you feel suspicious about the place you are invited to go, choose your own place such as McDonald's, Starbucks, KFC. If they are persistent at going to their \"place\" and make endless excuses to turn down your suggestions, use your common sense to tell if it's a scam. </li>\n<li> In a genuine tea shop, tea sampling is always for free. They just want you to taste and buy the tea leaves. If you have to pay, you will know it beforehand. </li>\n<li> In a teahouse, it is unusual if they serve you any premium tea without your knowledge. Remember that you are Laowai, a foreigner, you should not feel embarrassed to ask about the price. </li>\n<li> If you are asked to foot a bill at a ridiculous amount (more than Y500) without your prior knowledge, you know it's a scam. Don\u2019t pay. Call 110 and report the scam.</li>\n<li> If you are forced to pay, ask for a \"fapiao\" (\u53d1\u7968), an official sales invoice issued by the taxation department. It is against the law for an owner to refuse to give it to you. If you have the receipt, you can use it as evidence when making a report later. You should also pay by a credit card, because it is possible to cancel the payment later. </li></ol>\n<p>However, high prices do not necessarily indicate a scam. In a teahouse, &#165;50-200 per cup or pot of tea is common. In a bar, price range is even bigger, in which &#165;10-80 per bottle of beer is a norm and having a new bottle of wine can cost from a few hundred to many thousands. However, in all genuine places, prices should be stated clearly on a menu.\n</p><p>Finally, although it is perfectly possible to pay more than RMB1000 in a high-end teahouse and bar, run-of-the-mill teas and bars should not be nearly this expensive. Such delicate tea would only be offered to tea gourmets, not a casual tea taster. Furthermore, it is considered socially offensive to take a new friend to spend so much money and expect them to pay the bill. If this happens, it is most likely a scam.\n</p><p>Beware of the counterfeit 100 RMB note scam.  In this case, a taxi (or other merchant) that you have given one or more 100 RMB notes to purchase your good or service will perform a sleight of hand trick and swap your real 100 RMB notes for counterfeit ones.  Next they will inspect \"your\" 100 RMB notes (the fake ones that they swapped for yours) and point out that they are counterfeit.  They will then try and give you back \"your\" counterfeit 100 RMB notes and ask for other ones, perhaps closely inspecting the other ones.  This is most easily employed by a taxi driver when you're sitting in the back and can't see what they're doing with the money.  It is not very likely that you got fake 100 RMB notes out of an ATM so if someone is questioning your money that came from an ATM, they're probably scamming you.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Traffic\">Traffic</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=129\" title=\"Edit section: Traffic\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:182px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Beijing_Duche.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/1/1e/Beijing_Duche.jpeg/180px-Beijing_Duche.jpeg\" width=\"180\" height=\"140\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/1/1e/Beijing_Duche.jpeg/270px-Beijing_Duche.jpeg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/1/1e/Beijing_Duche.jpeg/360px-Beijing_Duche.jpeg 2x\" data-file-width=\"768\" data-file-height=\"599\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Beijing_Duche.jpeg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Traffic jam in Beijing</div></div></div>\n<p>Driving in China can range from nerve-rattling to outright reckless.\n</p><p>Traffic rules are practiced half-halfheartedly and rarely if ever enforced.

However, it is never off the scene in a big city and is particularly common just outside major tourist attractions and around major transportation hubs. Beggars may also show up outside some major temples which are popular among local worshippers because it is a tradition for buddhism practitioners to give money to beggars. \n</p><p>Be aware that child beggars may be victims of child trafficking. Fortunately it is becoming much less common compared to the early 2000s due to a strong crackdown from all over the society. You should avoid giving them any money. \n</p><p>In China, local people usually only give money to those who have obviously lost the ability to earn money.

Beijing, by some accounts, is the most polluted city in the world. 16 out of the worst polluted cities in the world are in China. Talking about air pollution has become a part of life for both locals and expatriates. Even the countryside, depending on the province in question, is not immune. The nature of air pollution makes it highly variable from day to day, depending on the weather. On days with strong wind or rain, the sky will be clear of any pollution.\n</p><p>In general, air pollutions are the worst in northern parts of the country. Cities close to the ocean such as Shanghai will have better air qualities, and pollutions are worse during the winter compared to the summer. Places at higher altitudes or plains like parts of Yunnan and Sichuan, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Tibet and outlying islands such as Hainan usually have good air quality. Visitors should be prepared to see smog, which can be quite heavy, in nearly all large cities, including those on the coast. \n</p><p>You will also hear a lot of noise. Construction and renovation are full-time activities.

Enforcement is generally weak, but penalty is extremely tough once an offender get caught. \n</p><p>Possession of certain drugs such as weed even for personal use may lead to a prison term. Be aware that the Chinese generally hold a strong negative against the use of drugs probably because their humiliation in the past 150 years are often linked to the spread of drugs.  Weed, heroin, LSD are the same to many of them, especially to the elder generations. It may make you appear foolish if you try to inform them that weed is common in the West. It is totally irrelevant to them. \n</p><p>Drug trade could result in a capital punishment and foreigners will not be exempted. In some cities such as Beijing, the police tend to see foreigners as high risk group. Body inspection can happen in a bar which is popular among expats. Random searches of cars may occur in the countryside and if caught with drugs, do not expect lenient treatment from the police. In 2009, a British national was executed for trafficking heroin amid the protest of the British government, but it just did not stop any execution.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Banned_items\">Banned items</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=133\" title=\"Edit section: Banned items\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Chinese government is known to try to control the media.

In cities, it varies from place to place. High quality bathrooms can be found inside major tourist attractions (e.g., the Forbidden City), at international hotels, office buildings, upper-class department stores, and shopping malls. Washrooms in McDonald's, KFC, Pizza Hut, or any of the coffee chains listed in the drink section are usually more or less clean. While those in common restaurants and hotels are barely acceptable, those in hotel rooms are generally very clean. Some public facilities are free, others cost from a few mao up to one or two kuai (\u00a51-2). Separate facilities are always provided for men (\u7537 n\u00e1n) and women (\u5973 n\u01da), but sometimes there are no doors on the front of the stalls. \n</p><p>The sit-down toilet familiar to Westerners is rare in China in public areas. Hotels will generally have them in rooms, but in places where Westerners are scarce, expect to find squat toilets more often than not. Many private homes in urban areas now have sit down toilets, and one major benefit from having a local host is that they have clean bathrooms. As a rule of thumb, a western establishment such as McDonald's will have a western toilet.\n</p><p>Carry your own tissue paper (\u536b\u751f\u7eb8 w\u00e8ish\u0113ngzh\u01d0, or \u9762\u7eb8 mi\u00e0nzh\u01d0) as it is rarely provided. You can sometimes buy it from the money-taker at a public toilet; you can also buy it in bars, restaurants and Internet cafes for \u00a52. Put used paper in the bucket next to the toilet; do not flush it away as it may block the often poor plumbing systems. \n</p><p>The Chinese tend to distrust the cleanliness of bathtubs. In hotels with fixed bathtubs, disposable plastic bathtub liners may be provided.\n</p><p>Wash your hands often with soap, or better carry some disposable disinfectant tissues (found in almost any department or cosmetics store), especially after having used public computers; the main cause for getting a cold or flu is through touching your face, especially the nose, with infected hands.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Food_.26_drink\">Food &amp; drink</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=137\" title=\"Edit section: Food &amp; drink\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are no widely enforced health regulations in restaurants. Restaurants generally prepare hot food when you order. Even in the smallest of restaurants, hot dishes are usually freshly prepared, instead of reheated, and rarely cause health problems. Most of the major cities have chain fast food places, and the hygiene in them tends to be good. Use common sense when buying food from street vendors. This is especially true for meat or seafood products; they can be very unsafe, particularly during warm weather, as many vendors don't have refrigeration. \n</p><p>A rule of thumb regarding street food is to make certain it is cooked thoroughly while you are watching; also, visit stalls frequented by locals, and look for plastic-wrapped disposable chopsticks. Minor stomach discomfort may still be experienced from street food and restaurant food alike, but is said to pass as one becomes accustomed to the local food. Ginger is effective against nausea, though it does not kill bacteria.\n</p><p>Even in the cities, Chinese people do not drink water straight from the tap, and you should not either. All hotels (even boats!) provide either a thermos flask of boiled water in your room (refillable by your floor attendant) or - more commonly - a kettle you can use to do it yourself. Generally, tap water is safe to drink <i>after</i> boiling. Purified drinking water in bottles is available everywhere, and is generally quite cheap. \u00a51 is normal for a small bottle, but it will be more in some places. Check that the seal on the cap is not broken.

No tip is needed for taxi drivers and most restaurants. Leaving a few coins in most restaurants, you will likely be chased by staff to give you back the money you 'forgot' to take.  In some cases, a fee regarded as tipping in America is actually a fixed fee, such as a fee for a doorman allowing you into a building at a late hour.</li>\n<li><b>Business Cards</b>: When presenting or receiving a business card or handing over an important paper, always use both hands, and never put it in pant pockets.</li>\n<li><b>Visitation</b>: A small gift taken to a host's home is always welcome. Wine, fruit, or some trinket from your native country are common. If the hosts are wearing slippers at home, and especially if there is carpet on the floor, remove your road shoes and ask for a pair of slippers before you enter your host's home, even if the host asks you not to. </li>\n<li><b>Hosting meals</b>: Hosts tend to order more food than you can eat because it is considered shameful if they can't stuff their guests. If you attempt to finish all food, it means that you're still hungry and may prompt your hosts to order more food (i.e. never totally clean your plate). However, this is changing in some parts of China where it has become more acceptable and preferable to minimise wastage at the end of a meal. It could be a good idea to observe other guests and follow suit.</li>\n<li><b>Dining</b>: Table manner varies from different places among different people in different scenarios. Sometimes you can see Chinese spit on a restaurant floor, pick their tooth in front of you and yell whilst dining but it is not always welcome. Follow what other people do. It very much depends on what kind of party you are involved in.</li>\n<li><b>Drinking</b>: When offered a drink, you are expected to take it or your friends will keep pushing you. Excuses like \"I'm allergic to alcohol\" is usually better than \"I don't feel like drinking\". Sometimes you can pretend that you are drunk. Don't panic as usually foreigners are tolerated much on these customs.</li>\n<li><b>Tobacco</b>: If you smoke, it is always considered polite to offer a cigarette to those you meet, as long as they are of adult age. This rule applies almost exclusively to men, but under certain circumstances, such as a club, it is okay to apply the rule toward women. If someone offers you a cigarette and you don't smoke, you can turn it down by politely and gently waving your hand.</li>\n<li><b>Staring</b>: As a traveler, you may find that your language, color of hair and skin, behavior, and manner of dress will draw long and sustained stares, especially outside the major cities. </li>\n<li><b>Saving Face</b>: The Chinese tend to be very concerned about \"saving face\". Pointing out mistakes directly may cause embarrassment. If you have to, call the person to one side and tell him/her in private, and try to do it in a polished manner.  </li>\n<li><b>Pointing</b>: Never point to statues of Buddhas or other deities with your index finger, as it is considered to be very rude. Instead, point at them with your thumb.</li>\n<li><b>Religion</b>: Swastikas have been widely used in Buddhist temples since the 5th century to represent Dharma, universal harmony, and the balance of opposites. Simillar to India, it does not represent Nazism. It is also worth noting that the local Jews have historically lived peacefully with their non-Jewish neighbours, and save for the Cultural Revolution, during which people of all religions and not just the Jews were persecuted. China does not have a history of significant anti-Semitism unlike the Inquisition in Europe.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gay_and_lesbian_travelers\">Gay and lesbian travelers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=140\" title=\"Edit section: Gay and lesbian travelers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Homosexuality was de-criminalized in 1997 and taken off the state list of mental disorders in 2001.

Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou are more in the open, with a range of gay bars and clubs, albeit nowhere near as brash and outspoken as their counterparts in other international cities.  Most Chinese are reluctant to discuss their sexuality in public, as it is generally considered to be a personal matter. But don't be surprised to find younger people in the cities openly discussing their sexual orientation.\n</p><p>Homosexual marriages and unions are not recognised in the country.

In most areas, with the exception of the downtown areas in big cities, you can find small shops that do laundry. The <b>sign</b> to look for on the front door is \u6d17\u8863 (<i>x\u01d0y\u012b</i>), or spot the clothes hanging from the ceiling. The cost is roughly \u00a52-5/item. In even the smallest of cities <b>dry cleaning</b> (\u5e72\u6d17 <i>g\u0101nx\u01d0</i>\uff09outlets are widely distributed and may be able to wash clothes. But in some areas you're going to be stuck washing clothes by hand, which is time consuming and tiresome. It may take days for a pair of jeans to dry, which is especially difficult if you're in a dorm room with no hangers, so fast drying fabrics, such as polyester or silk, are a good idea. If you do find a hotel that does laundry, usually they will put all your clothes into the wash together or even with other items from the hotel, so lighter colours are best washed by hand.\n</p><p><b>Smoking</b> is banned in public buildings and public transport except for restaurants and bars (including KTVs) - many of which are outright smoke dens, although many multinational restaurant chains do ban smoking. These bans are enforced across the country. Generally, smoking laws are most strict in Shanghai and Beijing, whilst they are more lightly enforced elsewhere. Many places (particularly train stations, hospitals, office buildings and airports) will have smoking rooms, and some long-distance trains may have smoking areas at the end of each car. Facilities for non-smokers are often poor; most restaurants, bars and hotels will not have non-smoking areas apart from top-end establishments although many modern buildings have a smoke extraction systems which suck cigarette smoke out of the room through a ceiling vent - meaning that the smoke doesn't hang in the air. The Chinese phrase for 'May I smoke?' is 'k\u011by\u01d0 ch\u014duy\u0101n ma?' and 'No Smoking!' is 'b\u00f9 k\u011by\u01d0 ch\u014duy\u0101n!'.\n</p>\n<h1><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact\">Contact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=142\" title=\"Edit section: Contact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h1>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Internet\">Internet</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=143\" title=\"Edit section: Internet\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Internet_Censorship\">Internet Censorship</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=144\" title=\"Edit section: Internet Censorship\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div style=\"display: table; border-radius: 6px; background-color: #fff3f3; border: 1px solid #a00; margin: 0.5em 1em 0 1em; padding: 6px; box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px #aaa;\" class=\"pp_warningbox\">\n<table>\n\n<tr style=\"vertical-align: top;\">\n<td style=\"width: 56px;\"><img alt=\"Travel Warning\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ambox_warning_pn.svg/50px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png\" title=\"Travel Warning\" width=\"50\" height=\"43\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ambox_warning_pn.svg/75px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/15/Ambox_warning_pn.svg/100px-Ambox_warning_pn.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"512\" data-file-height=\"445\" />\n</td>\n<td><span style=\"font-size: 130%; color: #a00\"><b>WARNING:</b></span>  As of September, 2014, Google Search, Gmail, Google Map and Google Translate all cannot be accessed in China without a VPN.

Pornographic, political sites, some Chinese language foreign-based news sites are routinely blocked. \n</p><p>Since the end of May in 2014, all google-related services, including Google Search, Gmail, Google Map, Google Translate fail to work in China. That is an unprecedented block on Google services and no reasons have been announced. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Blogspot, Wordpress, Picasaweb, WhatsApp are all banned. \n</p><p>Websites of many universities are not accessible as well, probably because those servers are also active in hosting China-related political materials. \n</p>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>What's banned</b><br />\n</p>\n<ul><li> Most Google-related services, including Gmail, Google Maps(google.cn/maps may still work), Play Store, and Translate(translate.google.cn may still work).</li>\n<li> Facebook, Twitter and Instagram</li>\n<li> Youtube and Vimeo</li>\n<li> Most Hong Kong-based media websites. </li>\n<li> Most English news services are generally accessible, but their Chinese versions may be banned. </li>\n<li> University websites may be banned, because their servers may also host so-called \"anti-China\" materials.</li></ul>\n<p><i>Complied as of December 2017</i>.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p><br />  \nWikipedia and Flickr are available, although certain web pages that contain sensitive keywords (usually in Chinese language only) may trigger the censorship system, called the Golden Shield (\u91d1\u76fe) (or euphemistically, the <i>Great Firewall</i> or <i>GFW</i> ) and result in the message \"your connection has been reset\". \n</p><p>Censorship is often tightened during certain sensitive periods, such as the annual meeting of China's parliament in March, the CCP congress every fourth October, and anniversaries such as the National Day in October and the Tiananmen massacre in June.\n</p><p>The most common way to access blocked sites is to use a proxy server. VPN (Virtual Private Network) which usually provides users with more stable and reliable access to banned websites for a fee starting from a few dollars per month. In Chinese this is known as \"climbing the wall\"(\u722c\u5899) and some companies may opt for specialized, yet in a gray-area, leased-line to access unrestricted internet. Other ways to bypass censorship include downloadable free software such as Freegate, Tor, Lantern and Psiphon. These introduce certain levels of encryption, and therefore so-called sensitive content can be seen. These should be downloaded before entering China as access to their official websites are blocked. \n</p><p>Another possibility for short-term visitors is to purchase a Hong Kong-based SIM with an internet plan and use it to access the internet. Because all data passes through servers based in Hong Kong, nothing is blocked, and there is no need to purchase a separate VPN subscription or to perform any additional set-up work. This is especially helpful for users of most Android phones due to tight integration with Google services, which are all blocked in China otherwise. There is some recommended Prepaid SIM card provider such as China Mobile Hong Kong, China Unicom Hong Kong and  Multi-Byte Info Hong Kong which providing such service. Multi-Byte Info provides long validity options on their China / Hong Kong Prepaid SIM's products, travellers can purchase SIM card before their travel to China on webshop which sending internationally such as prepaid.com.hk.\n</p><p>It is a legal offense to upload and submit any materials seen as subversive. However, regular internet users, especially English-speakers without political backgrounds, are usually free to write and send anything without a problem. \n</p><p>Certain companies like Yahoo have a track record of helping the government crackdown on political dissidents. In 2005, Shi Tao, a journalist in China, was imprisoned for ten years for releasing a document of the Communist Party to an overseas Chinese democracy site after Yahoo! China provided his personal Yahoo emails to the Chinese government.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Access\">Access</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=145\" title=\"Edit section: Access\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Lijiang_De_Wangba.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/41/Lijiang_De_Wangba.jpeg/200px-Lijiang_De_Wangba.jpeg\" width=\"200\" height=\"150\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/41/Lijiang_De_Wangba.jpeg/300px-Lijiang_De_Wangba.jpeg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/41/Lijiang_De_Wangba.jpeg/400px-Lijiang_De_Wangba.jpeg 2x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"600\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Lijiang_De_Wangba.jpeg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>An Internet caf\u00e9 in Lijiang</div></div></div>\n<p>China has more Internet users than any other country in the world and internet cafes (\u7f51\u5427 <i>w\u01cengb\u0101</i>) are abundant throughout China. Many of them are designed for gamers though and are not useful places to do business. It is cheap (\u00a51-6 an hour) to use a computer, albeit one with Chinese software. Internet cafes are supposed to require users to show identification (passport). Traffic may be monitored, and be aware that there maybe background malware recording keystrokes.\n</p><p>WIFI is pervasive in coffee shops and many restaurants. Free WIFI is provided especially in cafes such as Starbucks, Costa Coffee, some McDonald\u2019s and many private coffee houses. However, many free networks (including that in the Beijing's PEK Airport) require submitting a Chinese mobile number to which they can text an access code, thus rendering them off-limits to many foreigners.\n</p><p>Some hotels and hostels provide access from the rooms that may or may not be free; others may provide a wireless service or a few desktops in the lounge area.\n</p><p>You may also purchase a mobile data card for use with your own computer instead (these generally cost \u00a5400 and data plans run \u00a510-\u00a5200 per month depending on your usage). \n</p><p>Printing and CD burning service is provided in many hotels and hostels. You may also look for the characters \u590d\u5370 (f\u00f9y\u00ecn) meaning \u201cphotocopy\u201d. Printing costs about \u00a51-3 per page and photocopies are \u00a50.5-1 per page.

Calling outside the country is often difficult, and usually impossible without a calling card, which can often only be bought locally. The good news is these cards are fairly cheap, and the connection is surprisingly clear, uninterrupted and delay-free. Look for <b>IP Telephone Cards</b>, which typically have a value of \u00a5100 but sometimes can be had for as little as \u00a525. The cards have printed Chinese instructions, but after dialing the number listed on the card English-spoken instructions are available. As a general indication of price, a call from China to Europe lasts around 22 minutes with a \u00a5100 card. Calls to the U.S. and Canada are advertised to be another 20% cheaper.\n</p><p>If your line allows for international direct dialling (IDD), the prefix for international calls in China is <i>00</i>. So if you wish to make an overseas call, you would dial <i>00-(country code)-(area code)-(tel number)</i>. Note that calls from the mainland to Hong Kong and Macau require international dialling. <b>IDDs could be very expensive.</b> Ask the rate before calling.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mobile.2FCellular_Phones\">Mobile/Cellular Phones</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=150\" title=\"Edit section: Mobile/Cellular Phones\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Cellular phones have widespread use and offer very good service in China. They play an essential role in daily life for most Chinese and for nearly all expatriates in China. The typical expat spends a few hundred yuan buying a phone, then about \u00a5100 a month for the service; tourists might use it less.\n</p><p>If you already have a GSM 900/1800 cellphone, you can roam onto Chinese networks, but calls will be very expensive (\u00a512-35/minute is typical).  UMTS/HSDPA roaming is not available with every carrier, but you can buy a local SIM card for 3G data access (see below).  Chinese CDMA networks require R-UIM (SIM card equivalent), so most American CDMA phones will not work off the bat, but it's possible to program a new Chinese prepaid number into one at some shops for a fee of \u00a5100-400 &#8212; just don't forget to restore your old number before you leave. The exceptions are iPhones 5 and above; plug in a China Telecom R-UIM and it will work after a few minutes of automatic reconfiguration. Droid-series phones will have functioning call/text but making the data work will require perusing Chinese forums or finding a specialist shop at an electronics market to do the reconfiguration. Japanese CDMA phones require similar amounts of reconfiguration; SIM-unlocking and sticking to GSM may be easier.\n</p><p>If you have a non-CDMA smartphone and are planning on using 3G, China Unicom is your only option, as China Mobile uses a different technology which is unique to China. Calls and messages will still work but data won't, at least not at 3G speeds. 4G is a different story, as some phones sold overseas do support China Mobile 4G. The iPhone 6/6+ (if purchased directly from Apple) and iPhone 6S/6S+ all support China Mobile's 4G, but not 3G.\n</p><p>It's very difficult to get a Chinese SIM unless you speak Chinese, or have an interpreter with you. There are companies who can send these to you before you leave for China. A vending machine in Terminal 3 at Beijing airport sells China Mobile and China Unicom SIM cards for \u00a5100 each, and \u00a550 or \u00a5100 recharge vouchers.\n</p><p>For a short visit, consider renting a Chinese cell phone from a company such as Pandaphone <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.pandaphone.com/china_cell_phone_rental.htm\">[61]</a>. Rates are around \u00a57 a day. The company is based in the US but has staff in China. Toll free numbers are 866-574-2050 in the U.S. or 400-820-0293 in China. The phone can be delivered to your hotel in China prior to your arrival and dropped off there at the end of your trip, or shipped to you in the US. When you rent the phone, they will offer you an access code for calling to your country, which is cheaper than buying a SIM card from a local vendor and dialing directly.\n</p><p>If you're staying for more than a few days, it will usually be cheaper to buy a prepaid Chinese SIM card; this gives you a Chinese phone number with a certain amount of money preloaded. Chinese tend to avoid phone numbers with the bad-luck digit '4', and vendors will often be happy to offload these \"unsellable\" SIM-cards to foreigners at a discount.  If you need a phone as well, prices start around \u00a5100/200 used/new.  Chinese phones, unlike those sold in many Western countries, are never \"locked\" and will work with any SIM card you put in them.\nChina's two big operators are China Mobile <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.chinamobile.com/en/mainland/\">[62]</a> and China Unicom <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://eng.chinaunicom.com/\">[63]</a>.  <i>Most</i> SIMs sold by the two work nationwide, with Unicom allowing Hong Kong/Macau/Taiwan usage as well. There is usually a surcharge of about 1RMB/min when roaming outside the province you bought the SIM, and there are some cards that work only in a single province, so check when buying. You may also need to manually activate national roaming, which may incur a small daily surcharge as long as it's active.  For China mobile, you can get your credits balances by calling 1008611 and get a sms with balance.\n</p><p>International calls have to be enabled separately by applying for China Mobile's \"12593\" or China Unicom's \"17911\" service; both require a simple application with no deposit requirement. Usually there will be an English speaker, and let him/her know what you want.  Ask for the \"special\" dialing code, and for 1RMB/month extra on China Mobile (free on China Unicom), this will be provided to you. Enter the code, the country code, then the local number and you will be talking cheaply in no time.  Don't be fooled by cellphone shops with the China Mobile signage, be sure to go a to a corporate-operated location.  The employees will wear a blue uniform and there will be counter services. At time of writing, China Mobile is the cheaper of the two with calls to North America/Asia around \u00a50.4/min.  You can also use prepaid cards for international calling; just dial the number on the card as with a regular landline phone, and the charges will go to the prepaid calling card. \n</p><p>To recharge, visit the neighborhood office of your mobile service provider, give the staff your number and pay in cash to recharge your account. You can also recharge at any post office. Alternately, many shops will sell you a charge card, which has a number and password that must be used to call the telephone company to recharge the money in your account. You will be calling a computer and the default language is Chinese, which can be changed to English if you understand the Chinese. Charge cards are sold in denominations of \u00a530, 50 and 100. (If you're on Unicom, you have a local bank account, and you understand Chinese, you can recharge by bank transfer online; this is cheaper and sometimes there will be special offers for recharging this way)\n</p><p>For mobile data addicts, the \"Wo\" 3G USIM from China Unicom starts at \u00a566/month for 240 nationwide minutes, 10 videocall minutes, 300MB data, and some free multimedia/text content (ringtones, mobile news reports, wallpapers, music videos, etc). Incoming transmissions (video/voice call, text) from anywhere is completely free. For short-term use there is no longer a basic service fee, with calls around \u00a51/3 min, text messages \u00a50.10 each and data \u00a510/MB (overage for the \u00a596 plan is a more reasonable \u00a50.15/min, \u00a50.10 per text \u00a50.3/MB). The student plan (\u00a566 for 50 minutes, 240 texts, everything else same as \u00a596 plan) is also an option. China Mobile offers their \"Easy Own\" prepaid card, the offer also includes data plan options: \u00a5100 or \u00a5200 for 1 or 2 GB of data a month. It's possible to de-/activate this service with a short message to the number 10086. There is also a 5 G cap (maximum charge per month) of \u00a5500.\n</p><p>An alternative for those who want a Hong Kong number, the ability to recharge with a Visa/MasterCard credit card, and/or access to certain overseas websites that are otherwise blocked without paying a small fortune is to get dual-number Hong Kong-based SIM cards. A Hong Kong-based China Unicom SIM costs somewhat more at HK$0.60/minute (HK$0.45/minute in Guangdong), HK$0.50/text, and internet is HK$38/300MB daily or HK$78/500MB weekly for unfiltered internet (removing the need to pay for an outside VPN) but is not as unreasonably priced as roaming from most other countries. They now offer another plan with a unified mainland call pricing of HK$0.39/minute, free incoming calls, and data at HK$48/300MB weekly or HK$68/500MB monthly, but comes with a HK$18 basic monthly fee.\n</p><p>For those who want more data at the cost of speed (no 3G access), China Mobile Hong Kong actually charges less than China Mobile proper at HK$148 for 2.5GB data compared to \u00a5200 for 2GB, but charges the same higher voice rates as China Unicom HK. They now offer a SIM with unfiltered 4G access at higher prices-HK$48 daily (1GB at full speed, then throttled to no less than 128k), HK$118/1GB monthly or HK$198/2GB monthly. \n</p><p>Note that the downside to using a HK-based SIM is no cheap international calls; China Mobile HK, for instance, charges HK$5.80/minute to call all other countries from China, but softens the blow by offering a recharge bonus that increases with the amount of the top-up applied (for instance, a recharge of HK$300 gets you an extra HK$100, a recharge of HK$200 gets you an extra HK$50, and anything less than that but more than HK$50 gets a 10% bonus applied to it).\n</p><p>For the very short-term, the truly data-heavy users, or those to whom money is no object, Three HK data SIMs offer unlimited data in China (again unfiltered because everything runs through Three servers in HK) for HK$98/day. With their recharge bonus scheme a HK$300 recharge will last four days on top of the credit included with the SIM (2 days for the $198 SIM + 4 days from a $300 recharge make 6 days and HK$10 left over, for instance).\n</p><p>All of these can be purchased in HK, from specialist SIM dealers in larger cities, or online. \n</p><p>See also <a href=\"/en/Telephone_service_for_travel#Cell_phones\" title=\"Telephone service for travel\">cell phones</a>.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Area_codes\">Area codes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=151\" title=\"Edit section: Area codes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The country dialing code for mainland China is <b>86</b>.

The numbers are composed of 130 to 132 (OR 156/186) plus 8 digits (China Unicom, GSM/UMTS), 133/153/189 plus 8 digits (China Telecom, CDMA) or 134 to 139 (OR 150/152/158/159/188) plus 8 digits (China Mobile, GSM/TD-SCDMA).</li>\n<li> There used to be a service (\u5c0f\u7075\u901a <i>xi\u01ceo l\u00edngt\u014dng</i>) that offered landline numbers at lower prices but at the cost of not being able to move your phone between provinces; this is no longer available as the PHS networks in China have been completely shut down.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Emergency_numbers\">Emergency numbers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=China&amp;action=edit&amp;section=152\" title=\"Edit section: Emergency numbers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The following emergency telephone numbers work in all areas of Mainland China; calling them from a cell phone is free.\n</p>\n<ul><li> Patrol Police: 110</li>\n<li> Fire Department: 119</li>\n<li> (Government-owned) Ambulance/EMS: 120</li>\n<li> (some areas private-owned) Ambulance: 999</li>\n<li> Traffic Police: 122</li>\n<li> Directory inquiries: 114</li>\n<li> Consumer Protection: 12315</li></ul>\n<p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><a href=\"//wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Category%3AEast+Asia&amp;action=edit&amp;preload=Template:IsPartOf/preload\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"><img alt=\"Create category\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/15px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/23px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/30px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"300\" data-file-height=\"300\" /></a>\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20190329093128\nCache expiry: 86400\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.805 seconds\nReal time usage: 3.953 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 1457/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 5422/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 29398/3145728 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 14885/3145728 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/100\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   73.809      1 -total\n 15.33%   11.312      1 Template:Regionlist\n 14.87%   10.972      1 Template:Quickbar\n  6.90%    5.095      7 Template:Regionlistitem\n  6.20%    4.574      1 Template:Pagebanner\n  5.20%    3.840     12 Template:Quickbar_item\n  5.02%    3.704      1 Template:IsPartOf\n  4.15%    3.062      2 Template:Warningbox\n  3.91%    2.889     10 Template:Infobox\n  3.33%    2.460      5 Template:Related\n-->\n</div>\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key wikitravel_org_en:pcache:idhash:295-0!canonical and timestamp 20190329093124 and revision id 2588669\n -->\n"

target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://visitdenmark.com/\"><b>Denmark</b></a> is a country in <a href=\"/en/Scandinavia\" title=\"Scandinavia\">Scandinavia</a>. The main part of it is <a href=\"/en/Jutland\" title=\"Jutland\">Jutland</a>, a peninsula north of <a href=\"/en/Germany\" title=\"Germany\">Germany</a>, but also with a number of islands, including the two major ones, <a href=\"/en/Zealand\" title=\"Zealand\">Zealand</a> and <a href=\"/en/Funen\" title=\"Funen\">Funen</a>, in \u00d8sters\u00f8en Sea between Jutland and <a href=\"/en/Sweden\" title=\"Sweden\">Sweden</a>.\n</p><p>Once the seat of Vikings and later a major north European power, Denmark has evolved into a modern, prosperous nation that is participating in the general political and economic integration of Europe. However, the country has opted out of parts of the European Union's Maastricht Treaty, the European monetary system (EMU), and issues concerning certain internal affairs.\n</p><p>Denmark is also the birthplace of one of the world's most popular toys, Lego. There is no other better place in the world where one can buy Lego bricks than at the Legoland theme park in <a href=\"/en/Billund\" title=\"Billund\">Billund</a>.\n</p><p>Today Denmark is a society that is often seen as a benchmark of civilization; with progressive social policies, a commitment to free speech so strong it put the country at odds with much of the world during the 2006 cartoon crisis, a liberal social-welfare system and, according to The Economist, one the most commercially competitive. Top it off with a rich, well-preserved  cultural heritage, and the Danes legendary sense of design and architecture, and you have one intriguing holiday destination.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Understand\">Understand</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=1\" title=\"Edit section: Understand\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<dl><dd><i>\u201cMy life is a lovely story, happy and full of incident.\u201d</i> <small>&#8212; Hans Christian Andersen</small></dd></dl>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Terrain\">Terrain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Terrain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Denmark is home to the lowest 'highest point' in Europe; but what that exactly entails is somewhat uncertain. <b>Ejer Bauneh\u00f8j</b>, in the Lake District region south-west of <a href=\"/en/Aarhus\" title=\"Aarhus\">Aarhus</a>, seems to be the highest natural point (171m with a large tower built on top to commemorate the fact), although <b>Yding Skovh\u00f8j</b>, some 3km away stands 2m higher owing to an ancient burial mound. Either way, the 213m tall S\u00f8sterh\u00f8j Transmission Tower (1956), with its top 315m above sea level is technically the highest point in Denmark!\n</p><p>Overall, the terrain is dominated by mildly undulating agricultural landscapes, forests, minor lakes, extensive costal dunes, and marshes. Also, there are some scattered moors, especially in Jutland. The coastal scenery can be quite varied, and it includes the white cliffs of M\u00f8n, forested and deserted dune areas such as those near Skagen (including R\u00e5bjerg Mile and Rubjerg Knude), the cliffs of the Stevns peninsula and those of Bulbjerg and the Fur island. In Denmark, decidedly rocky scenery can only be found on Bornholm and nearby Ertholmene.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Culture\">Culture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Culture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Sports</b> are popular in Denmark, with football reigning supreme in popularity and counted as <i>the</i> national sport, followed by Handball, Gymnastics and Golf.\n</p><p>Another trait of Danish culture as any tourist pamphlet will tell you, is \"<b>Hygge</b>\", translating into cosy or snug.  Danes will be quick to point out that this is a unique Danish concept. However true, it does take a more prominent place in the culture compared to other countries.  Hygge usually involves low key dinners at home with long conversations over candlelight and red wine in the company of friends and family, but the word is broadly used for social interactions.\n</p><p>Another important aspect of Danish culture, is <b>understatement</b> and modesty, which is not only prominent in the Danish behavioural patterns.  It is also very much an important trait in the famous Danish design, which dictates strict minimalism and functionalism over flashiness.\n</p><p>The Danes are a fiercely <b>patriotic</b> bunch, but in a sly, low-key kind of way. They will warmly welcome visitors and show off the country, which they are rightly proud of, but any criticism - however constructive - will not be taken lightly. However, most Danes will happily spend hours to prove you wrong over a beer without becoming hostile. For the same reasons, outsiders on long term stays can be viewed with a certain amount of suspicion, as the <b>homogeneous</b> society is often thought to be the key to Denmark's successes. You will often hear resident foreigners complain about a constant pressure to become ever more Danish and the anti-immigrant Danish Peoples Party have seen increasing popularity over the years, taking 20% of the votes at the latest election which makes it Denmark's 2nd largest political party. \n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Environment\">Environment</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Environment\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:392px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Rapeseedandwindmills.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/28/Rapeseedandwindmills.jpg/390px-Rapeseedandwindmills.jpg\" width=\"390\" height=\"292\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/28/Rapeseedandwindmills.jpg/585px-Rapeseedandwindmills.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/2/28/Rapeseedandwindmills.jpg/780px-Rapeseedandwindmills.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1024\" data-file-height=\"767\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Rapeseedandwindmills.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Rapeseed fields and windmills are a common sight in the Danish summer. pictured: <a href=\"/en/%C3%86r%C3%B8\" title=\"\u00c6r\u00f8\">\u00c6r\u00f8</a></div></div></div>\n<p>Denmark is often praised as being one of the greenest countries in the world but apart from the ubiquitous bikes, the individual Danes are surprisingly nonchalant about the environment despite their reputation. As with so many other things, environmentalism is viewed as a collective responsibility. The Social Democratic leadership enacted a series of reforms, mainly <i>green taxation</i>, between 1993-2001, that made Danish society as a whole (especially in industrial production) one of the most energy efficient in the world. As a result, these technological advances has become of the country's largest export. Examples include thermostats, wind turbines and home insulation. Because of this, green policies enjoy unusually broad support among the people and the entire political spectrum. 20% of energy productions come from renewable energy, mainly wind power. This is made possible by the common Nordic energy market and the massive hydro energy resources in Norway and Sweden, which can easily be regulated up and down to balance the unreliable wind production.\n</p><p>All these green visions do have a few tangible implications for travellers:\n</p>\n<ul><li> Plastic bags cost money; DKK1-5 - non refundable, so bring a bag for shopping groceries.</li>\n<li> Cans and bottles have DKK1-3 deposit, refundable everywhere that sells the given product. This is why you\u00b4ll see some people having made a supplementary income or a \"profession\" of collecting empty bottles.</li>\n<li> Many toilets have half and full flush buttons, now - you figure out when to use which.</li>\n<li> There is a roughly 100% (DKK4) tax on gasoline, the total price usually hovers between DKK 9-11 per litre. (USD7-8 per gallon).</li>\n<li> In many counties you need to sort your waste in two separate 'biological' and 'burnable' containers.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Though not immediately obvious on a map, Denmark comprises more than 400 islands, of which 72 are populated.

Although the limit goes up to 130 on intercity stretches, large stretches of motorway around cities, major junctions and on the inter-island bridges have limits of 110 km/h or lower. Vehicles with caravans or trailers as well as trucks are limited to 80 km/h on motorways, 70 km/h on roads outside build-up areas and 50 km/h in build-up areas, even though other speed limits may be indicated. Speeding occurs frequently, especially on motorways, though recent years dedicated effort by the Danish police on speeding, has made more people aware of speed limits. Trucks in Denmark generally do 90-ish km/h on motorways and trucks overtaking each other on long stretches of motorway (collegially known as <i>elephant races</i>) occurs frequently. Fines ranges between DKK 500 (\u20ac 70) and 10,000 (\u20ac 1,370) and driving ban in Denmark.\n</p><p>Driving across the over-sea bridges can subject your car to very strong gusts of wind, and when overtaking lorries or close to bridge support columns the suddenly changing strength of the crosswinds should be anticipated. You may need to steer reactively and precisely to stay in your lane.\n</p><p>Wearing seatbelts in cars and vans is compulsory (if fitted), and children under 135 cm and or under 3 years of age, must use approved safety seating devices adapted to their height and weight.\n</p><p>Headlights must be switched on when driving at all times (and dipped during sun hours), regardless of weather conditions or whether it is a night or day, so switch them on. If your car has the new Daytime Running Lights, which are small but bright lights on the front only, that are different from headlights, these are enough until twilight. But turn on your headlights in fog or rain, and know that DRLs only light the front.\n</p><p>Drivers and passengers of motorcycles and mopeds must all wear ECE22.05 approved helmets.\n</p><p>Though required under law, little use is made of indicators on roundabouts, so generally if the car isn't indicating it is leaving the roundabout, give way as it is invariable going round. When changing lane on motorways use of turn signals prior to- and during overtaking is mandatory. \n</p><p>On open roads, especially those with an accompanying cycle path, expect drivers turning right to come to almost a dead stop, which they check to see they are not cutting up a cyclist, even if there is no way even an Olympic cyclist could appear from nowhere on an entirely cycle free horizon.\n</p><p>Denmark allows drivers to have 0.05 percent alcohol in the bloodstream while driving (for most people this is  equivalent to having consumed one drink or less), and Danish police is very aware of possible drunken drivers. Fine is calculated as <i>(percent of alcohol in blood) \u00d7 10 \u00d7 (your monthly salary before tax)</i>.\n</p><p>Watch out for the bicycles in the cities, especially when turning across bicycle lanes, the bicycles always have right of way. Special care should be taken at Roundabouts&#160;!.<br />\nCyclists in general seem suicidal to drivers from other countries, as they will not look, or slow down if turning onto the road in front of you. After sun hours, lights on bikes seem to be voluntary - especially in the bigger cities - even though it is in fact compulsory.\n</p><p>You must always carry your driving licence, vehicle registration document, and certificate of motor insurance in the car. It is compulsory to have a Warning triangle in the car, and to use it if you experience breakdowns on highways or on regular roads where you are not able to move your car out of the way.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Parking\">Parking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Parking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Parkeringsskive.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Parkeringsskive.jpg/300px-Parkeringsskive.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Parkeringsskive.jpg/450px-Parkeringsskive.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/Parkeringsskive.jpg/600px-Parkeringsskive.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3700\" data-file-height=\"2676\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Parkeringsskive.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Parking disc set for 02:50 or 14:50</div></div></div>\n<p>Ease of driving inside cities is a different story. Congestion in and around the major cities, especially during rush hours can be a trial for some people. If you are in your own car, it is wise to park it in a convenient central place and walk or use public transport, bike or taxi to get around the big cities. Most parking areas requires the use of parking discs/parking clock faces (in Danish <i>parkeringsskiver</i> or \"P-skiver\" in short) which must be placed in the right side of the front window, with the clock facing out of the window and the hour hand set to the time you park (there is no minute hand).\n</p><p>Some places require a parking ticket from a nearby parking ticket vending machine to be placed in the car, in the lower right corner of the dash-board, readable from outside the car. Some more modern parking ticket systems allow the purchase of parking tickets using text-messages from cell-phones, though this can be a very expensive affair from foreign numbers. The majority of the parking ticket vending machines, accepts international credit and debit cards, however this is still a large quantity that only accepts Danish national credit cards or coins. Note that in some areas - especially in the Copenhagen area - have multiple vending machines with different parking coverage. In this case the coverage is indicated with a map on left or right side of the machine. Be sure to check that the machine you purchase a ticket from, actually covers the area you have parked.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hiring_a_car\">Hiring a car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Hiring a car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<p>Though hiring a car in Denmark is a relatively expensive way to explore Denmark, it is convenient, efficient and particularly useful if you intend to visit more remote areas, where train and bus services may be less frequent. Prices starts a approx. 120\u20ac/day at the big car hire firms, but with limited mileage, typically 100 km per lease and an additional 25 km/day. It is not uncommon for car hire firms to require drivers to be at least of 21 years of age and request that payment be done with an international credit card.\n</p><p>Be aware that Scandinavia is no exception to the widespread European scam of adding hidden charges to your car rental bill, and not including services like auto assistance. Also, unlike other goods and services, quoted car rental rates may not include the 25% V.A.T. or sales tax for purchases by private people. Carefully read the rental agreement before you accept your car.\n</p><p>If possible renting a car in Sweden (just across the Sound from Copenhagen and Elsinore) or Germany (just south of the border in Jutland) can be an economically sound move. Car rentals in Sweden and Germany are less than half the price of Danish rentals and mostly comes with free mileage.

People who pick up hitchhikers usually speak English. \nDestination boards are recommended.  It is illegal to hitchhike on the highways, so it is better to use highway-entrances and gas stations.  When crossing by ferry, try to get into a car that already paid for the ticket.\n</p><p>If you hitchhike from the southern part of Denmark (direction from Hamburg or Kiel, Germany), and continue in direction to Copenhagen, make sure the driver doesn't stop in Kolding. If he does, ask him to stop at the last gas station before Kolding.

Since most of the country's airports were build as military airfields during the second world war, they are often inconveniently located far from town centres, which as a general rule make train travel nearly as fast from town centre to town centre for destinations less than 3 hours by train from Copenhagen. For destinations further afield trains will often get you where you want to go a lot cheaper, albeit competition is heavy, and it is indeed sometimes possible to find plane tickets cheaper than the train, if you book well ahead of your planned departure - this is especially true for the Copenhagen - Aalborg route, where both traffic and competition is heaviest. \n</p><p>Airports with domestic traffic are: <a href=\"/en/Copenhagen\" title=\"Copenhagen\">Copenhagen</a>, <a href=\"/en/Billund\" title=\"Billund\">Billund</a>, <a href=\"/en/Aarhus\" title=\"Aarhus\">Aarhus</a>, <a href=\"/en/Aalborg\" title=\"Aalborg\">Aalborg</a>, <a href=\"/en/Karup\" title=\"Karup\">Karup</a>, <a href=\"/en/S%C3%B8nderborg\" title=\"S\u00f8nderborg\">S\u00f8nderborg</a> and <a href=\"/en/Bornholm\" title=\"Bornholm\">Bornholm</a>.\n</p><p>Some of the more remote islands, if there is any such thing in a country as small as Denmark, also sees regular taxi flights from <a href=\"/en/Roskilde\" title=\"Roskilde\">Roskilde</a> airport to their small airfields, on-board small propeller aircraft.

It is, in theory, very similar to <a href=\"/en/Norwegian_phrasebook\" title=\"Norwegian phrasebook\">Norwegian</a> Bokm\u00e5l and also to <a href=\"/en/Swedish_phrasebook\" title=\"Swedish phrasebook\">Swedish</a>, and is to some extent intelligible to speakers of those languages, especially in written form.  However, it sounds different from Norwegian and Swedish.  It is also more distantly related to <a href=\"/en/Icelandic_phrasebook\" title=\"Icelandic phrasebook\">Icelandic</a> and <a href=\"/en/Faroese_phrasebook\" title=\"Faroese phrasebook\">Faroese</a>, though spoken Danish is not mutually intelligible with these languages.\n</p><p><b>English</b> is widely spoken in Denmark (close to 90% of the population speaks it, making Denmark one of the most English proficient countries on the planet where English is not an official language), and many Danes have near native fluency. Danish school children start their English lessons in third grade (when they're 8 years old), and regular English lessons continue until students finish high school, and many Danish university courses are fully or partially taught in English. In this regard, it is worth noting that Denmark is probably one of very few countries in the world, where you get no extra points for trying to speak the language, and Danes in general have very little patience with non-fluent speakers. So except for a few words like <i>Tak</i> (thank you) or <i>Undskyld</i> (excuse me), English-speakers are much better off just speaking English than fighting their way through a phrasebook. If you do try, and the person you are talking to immediately switches to English, don't feel bad as it is not meant to condescend or belittle. Also of note, the Danish language has no equivalent to the English word \"please\" so at times it may seem as though Danes are rude when speaking English. This is not their intention.\n</p><p>Many Danes also speak <b>German</b>. Denmark is one of the top countries in Europe when it comes to knowledge of the German language, since more than 58% of the population has a good knowledge of the language. It is widely spoken in areas that attract many tourists from Germany, i.e. mainly the Jutland West Coast, the southern part of Funen and nearby islands (e.g. <a href=\"/en/Langeland\" title=\"Langeland\">Langeland</a> and <a href=\"/en/%C3%86r%C3%B8\" title=\"\u00c6r\u00f8\">\u00c6r\u00f8</a>), and also especially in Southern Jutland (S\u00f8nderjylland / Northern Schleswig), where it has status of a minority language. Elsewhere in the country, many people prefer to avoid speaking it, even when they do have some command of the language, and you will have a hard time convincing anyone to (outside the tourist industry) otherwise: this has nothing to do with history but is merely a result of the high fluency in English, making the locals less inclined to struggle through a language they are not entirely comfortable with. In a pinch or emergency though, people will probably step up, and do their best to help.  There is a native or indigenous German speaking minority along the southern border to Germany (S\u00f8nderjylland / Northern Schleswig) and vice verse across the frontier there is a small community of Danish speakers to be found in Germany.\n</p><p><b>French</b> is also spoken to some degree, as all Danish students have received at least three years of lessons in either German or French, but given the Danes' limited contact with the French language, fluency tends to be lagging.\n</p><p>Foreign television programmes and films are almost always shown in their original language with subtitles. Only children's programmes are dubbed into Danish.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See\">See</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=29\" title=\"Edit section: See\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#See\" title=\"click to add a see listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '29', 'see', 'Denmark');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Denmark's top tourist attractions (2008)</b><br />\n</p>\n<ol><li> <b>Tivoli</b>, <a href=\"/en/Copenhagen\" title=\"Copenhagen\">Copenhagen</a>, Amusement park - 3.9 mio.  </li>\n<li> <b>Dyrehavsbakken</b>, <a href=\"/en/Copenhagen\" title=\"Copenhagen\">Copenhagen</a>, Amusement park - 2.6 mio.</li>\n<li> <b>Legoland</b>, <a href=\"/en/Billund\" title=\"Billund\">Billund</a>, Amusement park - 1.6 mio. </li>\n<li> <b>Copenhagen Zoo</b>, <a href=\"/en/Copenhagen\" title=\"Copenhagen\">Copenhagen</a>, Zoo - 1.4 mio.</li>\n<li> <b>Faarup Sommerland</b>, <a href=\"/en/Blokhus\" title=\"Blokhus\">Blokhus</a>, Amusement park - 0.6 mio, </li>\n<li> <b>Louisiana</b>, <a href=\"/en/Humleb%C3%A6k\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Humleb\u00e6k\">Humleb\u00e6k</a>, Art museum - 0.5 mio.</li>\n<li> <b>Djurs Sommerland</b>, <a href=\"/en/East_Jutland\" title=\"East Jutland\">East Jutland</a>, Amusement park - 0.5 mio.</li>\n<li> <b>BonBon-Land</b>, <a href=\"/en/N%C3%A6stved\" title=\"N\u00e6stved\">N\u00e6stved</a>, Amusement Park - 0.4 mio.</li>\n<li> <b>Odense Zoo</b>, <a href=\"/en/Odense\" title=\"Odense\">Odense</a>, Zoo - 0.4 mio</li>\n<li> <b>The National Museum</b>, <a href=\"/en/Copenhagen\" title=\"Copenhagen\">Copenhagen</a>, Museum - 0.3 mio.</li></ol>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"The_Danish_Islands\">The Danish Islands</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=30\" title=\"Edit section: The Danish Islands\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Though not well known to casual visitors Denmark is an island nation, with 72 inhabited islands and a further 371 uninhabited ones.

The most visual heritage is the burial mounds dotting the landscape everywhere in the country (actually, most of these are from the earlier Bronze Age period), but there are a few attractions for the inclined to visit. Easiest and perhaps most interesting are the two museums near <a href=\"/en/Roskilde\" title=\"Roskilde\">Roskilde</a>, easily reached on a day trip from <a href=\"/en/Copenhagen\" title=\"Copenhagen\">Copenhagen</a> - the Viking ship museum is extraordinary with some well preserved ships and the Lejre Experimental Centre Sagnlandet, a living history museum with a recreated Viking village.

On the accompanying slip, however, you are immediately informed of the allowed seasons and allowed sizes of the most common species encountered on the Danish coastline. Sea Trout is common, as is Cod and Plait, and save for a few inland fjords, water quality and thus fish populations are reasonable.\n</p><p>As for freshwater fishing, Denmark offers a diverse number of streams and brooks (no actual rivers, though), that host Salmon, Brown, Rainbow and Sea Trout (in the season), and Grayling, as well as Pike, Perch and Roach, as do a number of inland lakes which also host Zander, Bream and Tench. Freshwater fishing is a bit more complicated than coastal fishing in Denmark, however, as there is a host of local communities presiding over the rights to fish in the specific waters, usually in agreement with the land owners where the waters are situated if they aren't owned by the state, but that also means that some stretches of a specific stream or brook may be off-limits, due to the land owner's ownership. Regulations for seasons and sizes are mandated by the state, but prices and terms for permits are regulated by the communities. Local tourist offices are usually well informed and mostly allowed to sell permits, which may be daily, weekly, monthly or yearly.\n</p><p>Lastly, there is a significant number of \"Put-and-Take\" facilities that doesn't require a permit as such, but where you purchase the right to fish for a number of hours, but where the owner of the facility guarantees that there are fish present - usually Rainbow Trout - but whereas many facilities are \"self-serve\" in the sense that you fill out a form and dump it, and the corresponding payment, in a post box, don't be surprised if the proprietor comes by at some time to ask if you are in luck, at the same time keeping track of the number and times of the forms, hours and payments that he has collected from the box.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hunting\">Hunting</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Hunting\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Hunting in Denmark is done on the basis of land owners retaining the right to hunt on their premises and then, possibly renting it out to interested parties, keeping a close check on who hunts where and when.\n</p><p>Thus, whereas it is relevant to note that a general hunting permit (DKK 500,-) is required, hunting is almost exclusively done with people that you know, who have the hunting rights to the land in question, so if you want to go hunting in Denmark, you would most probably need to befriend a land owner or a friend of one beforehand.\n</p><p>Note that danish weapons legislation is extremely restrictive. Generally any type of weapon is illegal to own or carry anywhere! There are exceptions for hunting and weapons clubs, but this requires a special permit, and outside the shooting area (hunting grounds or club) the weapon must be concealed and not loaded. Many types of knives are also illegal. Weapon types which cannot be used for hunting or shooting contents - such as knuckles - are just outright illegal anytime and anywhere. The fine for carrying an illegal weapon, especially if it is ready to use, may be severe: A heavy fine and possibly some weeks in prison.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hiking\">Hiking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39\" title=\"Edit section: Hiking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Hiking in Denmark is easy as there are many trails allover the country.

In the more \"touristy\" shops in Copenhagen, and at the traditional beach resorts along the Jutland West Coast and Bornholm Island it will often be possible to pay in Euro. The Danish krone is pegged to the Euro to an accuracy of 2.25%. In the 12 months from Aug 2005 to Aug 2006 the average exchange rate was 1 EUR = 7.46 DKK. The Kroner comes in 50 \u00f8re (\u00bd kroner) copper coins, 1, 2 and 5 kroner silver nickel coins with a hole in the centre, and finally solid 10 and 20 kroner bronze coins. Notes comes in nominations of 50 (Purple), 100 (Orange), 200 (Green) 500 (Blue) and 1000 (Red) kroner. Note that the 1997 series of banknotes are being replaced with a new series, starting with the 50 kroner note in 2009 and ending with the 1000 kroner note in 2011, hence you can expect to see two types of bank notes circulating in the coming years, both are legal tender. \n</p><p>Faroese kr\u00f3na and the coming series of Greenlandic bank notes, while of exactly the same face value, are not legal tender in Denmark (and vice-versa), but can by law be exchanged in any bank free of charge at a 1:1 ratio.  \n</p><p>Automatic teller machines are widely available even in small towns, but some <b>ATM'</b>s are closed during night time out of security reasons. The Danish word is <i>Dankort/h\u00e6ve-automat</i>, and might be useful to remember as the term ATM is not universally known. \n</p><p>Nearly all machines regardless of operator will accept the Danish <i>Dankort</i>, MasterCard, Maestro, Visa, Visa Electron, American Express, JCB og China UnionPay (CUP). While the majority of retailers accept International credit- and debit cards, many still only accept the local Dankort. Virtually everywhere you are required to use a <b>PIN-code</b> with your card, so if this is not common practice in your country, remember to request one from your bank before leaving home. Also beware that most retailers will add a 3%-4% transaction charge (often without warning) if you pay with a foreign credit card.\n</p><p>Note that a few machines will <b>not</b> accept <b>PIN-codes</b> longer than 4 characters, which can create problems for north-american or other european users. Ask the clerk operating the machine if it accepts 5-digit PIN-codes before attempting to operate the machine. Your card may be rejected even without entering the PIN if it is incompatible. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Prices\">Prices</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41\" title=\"Edit section: Prices\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>You should note that almost everything in Denmark is expensive. All consumer sales include a 25% sales tax (<i>Moms</i>) but displayed prices are legally required to include this, so they are always exact.

While a three course meal at a standard restaurant will usually set you back around 200 DKK ($35), this can be done cheaper if you eat caf\u00e9s or pizza joints, 30-70 DKK ($5.50 to 12.50). Sundries like a 1\u00bdl bottle of Coca Cola costs 25 DKK ($4.50), while a beer will cost you 4 DKK (70 cents) in a supermarket, and 25-50 DKK ($4.50 to 9) in bar.

Traditional Danish fare includes items as pickled herring, fried plaice, and other assorted seafood items.  Hearty meat dishes are also prevalent, as seen in items such as frikadeller (pork only or pork and veal meat balls topped by a brown sauce) and \"stegt fl\u00e6sk og persillesovs\" (thick pork bacon slices topped by a parsley cream sauce).  Many meals are also accompanied by a beer, and shots of aquavit or schnapps, though these are mainly enjoyed when guests are over. Drinking along with meals is encouraged as the foods are enhanced by the drinks, and vice versa. If looking for a quick snack to grab on the go, try the traditional Danish hot dog, served in a bun with a variety of fixings, including pickles, fried or raw onions as well as ketchup, mustard and remoulade (a Danish invention in spite of the French name, consisting of mayonnaise with the addition of chopped cabbage and turmeric for color). For dessert, try either \"ris \u00e0 l'amande\" (rice pudding with almonds and cherries, again a French name with no relation to French cuisine) or \u00e6bleskiver (ball-shaped cakes similar in texture to American pancakes, served with strawberry jam), both normally only available in November and December. For candy try a bag of \"Superpiratos\" (hot licorice candy with salmiakki).\n</p><p>In the past few years, Copenhagen has emerged as a very happening place for food enthusiasts and gastronomic travelers, the highlight being the world-renowned restaurant <i>Noma</i>.\n</p><p>Do avoid touristy places where no Danes are to be found, popularity amongst locals is almost always an indicator of quality.\n</p><p>Restaurants offering examples of international cuisine are common, mostly in major cities, especially Italian, Turkish and Chinese restaurants, though Japanese, Indian and even Ethiopian restaurants can be found too.

And the Danes have become infamous for being closed and tight lipped, bordering on outright rude. So while it is by no means impossible, you will still be hard pressed to find a Dane readily engaging in casual conversations with strangers. That is, until you hit the country's bars and nightclubs</i>. \n</p><p>As any foreigner who has spend time observing the Danes will tell you, alcohol is the fabric that holds Danish society together. And when they are off their face in the dead of night, they suddenly let their guard down, loosen up, and while a bit pitiful, they somehow transmorph into one of the most likable bunch of people on Earth. Rather than the violence associated with binge drinking elsewhere, because it seems to serve a very important social purpose, the natives get very open, friendly and loving instead. It takes some time getting used to, but if you want to form bonds with the Danes, this is how you do it - God help you if you are abstinent. This also means Danes have a very high tolerance for drunk behavior, provided it takes place in the weekends. Drink a glass or two of wine for dinner during the week is normal, as well as 20 pints on a Saturday night, and puke all over the place.\n</p><p>There is <b>no legal drinking age</b> in Denmark, although a legal purchase age of 16 is in effect in shops and supermarkets, and 18 in bars, discos and restaurants. The enforcement of this limitation is somewhat lax in shops and supermarkets, but quite strict in bars and discos, as fines of up to DKK 10,000 and annulment of the license can incur on the vendor. The purchaser is never punished, although some discos enforce a voluntary zero-tolerance policy on underage drinking, where you can get kicked out if caught with no ID and an alcoholic beverage in your hand. Some would claim that the famous Danish tolerance towards underage drinking is waning in light of recent health campaigns targeting the consumption of alcoholic beverages amongst Danes. As adult Danes do not approve of the government interfering with their own drinking habits, the blame is shifted towards adolescents instead, and proposals of increasing the legal purchase age to 18 overall have been drafted, but have yet to pass Parliament, neither is it likely too in the foreseeable future. \n</p><p>Drinking alcoholic beverages in <b>public</b> is considered socially acceptable in Denmark, and having a beer out in a public square is a common warm weather activity there, though local by-laws are increasingly curbing this liberty, as loitering alcoholics are regarded as bad for business. Drinking bans are usually signposted, but not universally obeyed and enforced. In any case, be sure to moderate your public drinking, especially during the daytime. Extreme loudness may in the worst case land you a few hours in jail for public rowdiness (no record will be kept, though). Most police officers will instead ask you to leave and go home, though.\n</p><p>Danish beer is a treat for a <b>beer enthusiast</b>.  The largest brewery, Carlsberg (which also owns the Tuborg brand), offers a few choices, as well as a delicious \"Christmas beer\" in the 6 weeks leading up to the holidays.  Other tasty beverages include the Aquavit (Snaps) and Gl\u00f8gg - a hot wine drink popular in December. Danish beer is mostly limited to lager beer (<i>pilsner</i>), which are good, but not very diverse. However in the last few years Danes have become interested in a wider range of beers, and Danish microbreweries' excellent products are increasingly available. The Danish Beer Enthusiasts <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.ale.dk/\">[56]</a> maintain a list of bars and restaurants with a good selection of beers as well as a list of stores with a good selection.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sleep\">Sleep</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47\" title=\"Edit section: Sleep\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Sleep\" title=\"click to add a sleep listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '47', 'sleep', 'Denmark');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Due to the compact size and dense population, unlike the other Scandinavian countries, Danes and visitors does not enjoy the <a href=\"/en/Right_to_access\" title=\"Right to access\">Right to access</a> in Denmark, visitors who want to enjoy the outdoors can overnight in one of the more than 500 <b>camping</b> grounds, most are well equipped with up to date facilities.

Compared to most other European countries crime is average and common sense should keep you out of any trouble.\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>Animals</b>: There is one relatively timid poisonous snake, the European viper (<i>Hugorm</i>), whose bite very rarely is lethal. If you are walking in the woods or open areas with some ground cover during the summer, closed footwear is recommended. There is also a fish, the greater weever (<i>Fj\u00e6sing</i>), with poisonous spines, that buries iself in the sand. The sting is painful, much worse than a sting from wasps or bees but is almost never lethal. The pain can be reduced by submersing the injury in hot water for at least 15 minutes. Once the pain has eased, the injury should be checked for any remaining spine fragments, and any such should be removed. If the pain does not mostly fade away within a few hours, you should seek medical attention. Medical attention should also be sought if the pain spreads to other areas than the original injury and if one experiences servere symtoms such as abnormal heart rhythms, weakness, shortness of breath, seizures, decreased blood pressure, gangrene, tissue degeneration and/or unconsciousness.</li>\n<li> <b>On foot</b> in cities Danes drive by the rules, and they have every expectation that pedestrians do the same. Therefore, it is important to obey <b>Walk/Don't Walk</b> signals and avoid jaywalking in cities, simply because cars will not slow down since you're  not supposed to be there. Also, take good notice of the dedicated bike lanes when crossing any street to avoid dangerous situations as bikers tend to ride fast and have right of way on these lanes.</li>\n<li> On the <b>beach</b>: Don't bathe alone. Don't get too far away from land. Swim along the coast rather than away from it. In some areas undertow is a danger, and kills a number of tourists every year, but will mostly be signed at the beach. If you get caught by the undertow, do <b>NOT</b> fight the current. Instead use only as much energy as you need to stay afloat and let the current carry you out. Once the current dies out, swim parrallell to the beach for some time, before swimming back. On many beaches, flags inform of water quality. A blue flag means excellent water quality, green flag means good water quality, red flag means that bathing is not advised. A sign with the text \"Badning forbudt\" means that bathing is forbidden. Obey these signs, as it often means that the water is polluted with poisonous algae, bacteria, or chemicals, or that there is a dangerous undertow.</li>\n<li> In the city: A few districts in major cities are probably best avoided at night by the unwary - but reverse of the trends in North America, it is often the ghettos in the suburbs that are unsafe, rather than the downtown areas. </li></ul>\n<p>In an emergency dial <b>112</b> (medical help/fire brigade/police). This is toll free, and will work even from cell phones even if they have no SIM card. For the police in not-emergencies call <b>114</b>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=49\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Health services in Denmark are of a high standard, although waiting times at emergency rooms can be quite long for non emergencies, since visitors are prioritized according to their situation. Except for surgical procedures there is no private healthcare system to speak of, all is taken care of by the public healthcare system and general practitioners. <i>All</i> visitors are provided with <b>free emergency care</b>, until you are deemed healthy enough to be transported back to your home country. Citizens from EU countries, Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and certain British dependencies are all entitled to additional basic medical services during their stay, other nationalities should have a valid travel insurance for transportation home and any additional medical care needed after any emergency is dealt with, as this is not provided free of charge. As in the rest of the country, English speakers should not have any trouble <b>communicating</b> with staff in English.\n</p><p>One thing worth noting for several nationalities, is that Danish doctors don't strew out prescriptions or pills out at the rate common in North America, Japan and Southern Europe. There is a general trend of letting the body's own immune system take care of diseases, rather than using <b>medicines</b>. So if you show up at the local GP with minor illnesses like the common flu, expect to be send back to your bed to rest, rather than receiving any treatment, if you are otherwise of good health. <b>Pharmacies</b> (Danish: Apotek) are usually well stocked, but brand names may differ from those in your own country. Staff is highly trained, and major cities usually have one 24 hour pharmacy. Many drugs that are prescription-free in other countries, require prescription in Denmark, which is not trivial to get (see above), and medicines available in supermarkets and drug stores are very limited; i.e. allergy drugs and light painkillers; Paracetamol based (Panodil, Pamol &amp; Pinex), acetylsalicylic based (Treo, Kodimagnyl &amp; Aspirin) and Ibuprofen based (Ipren)\n</p><p><b>Dentists</b> are only partly covered by the public healthcare system, and everyone, including Danes pay to visit their dentist. Danes and other Nordic citizens have some of the expenses covered by the public healthcare system, while non Scandinavian visitors, should generally be prepared to foot the entire bill themselves, or forward the expenses to their insurance company. Prices are notoriously high compared to the neighbouring countries, so unless it is urgent to see a dentist, it will probably be more economical to wait until you return home, or pass into Germany or Sweden.  \n</p><p><b>Tap water</b> is potable unless indicated. The regulations for tap water in Denmark even exceeds that of bottled water in general, so don't be offended if you notice a waiter filling a can of water at the sink. Restaurants and other places selling food are visited regularly by health inspectors and are awarded points on a 1-4 \"smiley scale\". <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.findsmiley.dk/en-US/Forside.htm\">[67]</a> The ratings must be prominently displayed, so look out for the happy face when in doubt. While pollution in the major cities can be annoying it doesn't pose any risk to non-residents. Nearly all beaches are fine for bathing - even parts of the Copenhagen harbour recently opened for bathing (read the Stay safe section).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Smoking\">Smoking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=50\" title=\"Edit section: Smoking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As of 15 August 2007, it is illegal to smoke in any indoor public space in Denmark.

Don\u00b4t talk on the phone there. In fact, don't talk at all. These are for people who want a quiet trip, usually people who need to go far, and may want to sleep, read, or work on their laptop or other things in peace.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Danes try to abridge differences between social classes. <b>Modesty is a virtue</b> - bragging, or showing off wealth, is considered rude, as is loud and passionate behaviour. Economic matters are private - don't ask Danes questions like how much they earn or what their car costs. As in Germany, Britain, and the rest of the Nordic countries, weather is a good conversation topic.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Greetings between people who know each other (e.g. are good friends, close relatives, etc.) are often in the form of a <b>careful hug</b>. It is rare to see a peck on the cheek as a form of greeting, and it might be taken as way too personal. A handshake is customary for everyone else, including people you aren't close to and people you are being introduced to.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> When invited by a Dane - to visit their home, join them at their table or engage in an activity - don't hesitate to accept the invitation. Danes generally don't strew invitations out of politeness, and only say it if they mean it. The same goes for compliments. Bring a <i>small</i> gift; chocolate, flowers or wine are the most common, and remember despite their disregard for formality, to practice good table manners while at restaurants or in people's homes.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Even though 82% of the population is officially Lutheran, Denmark is by and large an <b>agnostic country</b>. Investigations into people's faith are usually unwelcome. Saying grace for example, is likely to be met with bewilderment and silence. Religious attire such as Muslim headscarfs, kippahs or even t-shirts with religious slogans, make make some Danes feel uncomfortable. If someone sneezes <b>do not</b> say \"Bless you\" under any circumstances, instead say \"Prosit\" or \"Gesundheit\" (\"Prosit\" is higly recommended since it's the Danish way of saying it) However, words like \"Oh my god\" are welcome.</li>\n<li> If in Denmark on business, it's important to note that family nearly without exception takes priority over work. So don't be surprised if Danes excuse themselves from even the most important of meetings by 4PM to pick up kids, a burden equally shared between the sexes.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact\">Contact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=52\" title=\"Edit section: Contact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Internet\">Internet</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=53\" title=\"Edit section: Internet\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>While Internet caf\u00e9s are present in most larger cities, they are usually not geared for tourists and hence they can be a bit tricky to find. Hotels usually provide both wireless internet and computers with internet access, but whether this service is provided for free, varies greatly - many caf\u00e9s and bars also provide free wireless internet for paying customers, even when it is not signposted, so it is always a good idea to ask. The easiest way to get online is often the public library, as there is one in almost every town, they are usually centrally located, well signposted (look for <i>Bibliotek</i>) and always free - there can be a bit of waiting time to get a free computer though, but there will normally also be some sort of reservation system in place, so you can time it better.\n</p><p>If you are staying for more than a few weeks, you may also consider getting a mobilt broadband connection - most of the country has excellent coverage and speeds rivaling those of a fixed connection in the major cities and plenty for surfing the web, even in many of the more remote areas. Unfortunately the Danish ISPs generally don't have up to date English versions of their websites, so getting information about coverage and store location can be tricky. If you don't have a residents permit, a CPR and a local address you will not be able to buy a subscription, but Telia, TDC and Telenor offer prepaid packages you can buy as a foreigner. Telia's prepaid package starts at 50 DKK per GB while TDC's and Telenor's are quite expensive at 1000 DKK per GB. You can buy the Telia package in their stores located in the largest towns - if you have a modem that support UMTS/HSPA+/LTE you will most likely be able to use it, otherwise you can buy one for 500 DKK.<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.bredbaandsmatch.dk/english/tourist/\">[68]</a>\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Phone\">Phone</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=54\" title=\"Edit section: Phone\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Bring your own unlocked GSM phone to make calls. Prepaid SIM cards are available at most shops and international calling can be reasonably priced. Any prepaid credit generally only valid for calls made in Denmark, but can be purchased in small amounts to avoid waste when you leave. Data access on prepaid cards is very expensive as the 4 major Danish providershave locked out the monthly subscription market that include generous data allowances to Danish resident holders only; a rule enforced by local government.\n</p><p>International collect calls are not allowed from phone booths, which are all ran by the TDC company. You should be able to make international call with the prepaid SIM cards anyways.\n</p><p>Denmark's international phone country code is <b>45</b>. The prefix for international dialing is  \"00\" or '+' (on a mobile phone).\n</p><p>When calling a Danish company expect to be connected directly to a Danish phone operator or digital system in Danish; if you wait till the end of the introduction and available options there's usually a separate English option, otherwise hit #.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mail\">Mail</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=55\" title=\"Edit section: Mail\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most towns of any size have a post office or a supermarket licensed to handle mail and parcels. Service is efficient but slower now, and you can expect mail posted in the post office, or in a mailbox before it is emptied (hours are no longer posted on the mailbox, just a promise to collect every 5 days) to arrive within 5 days in Denmark and Southern Sweden. Mail to the rest of Europe, the United States and Canada needs one extra day, while delivery time to the rest of the world varies greatly, and mostly depends on the postal service in the receiving country. Most post offices in Denmark also handle Western Union money transfers, ticket sales for events, currency exchange and sell phone cards for international calls. Standard prices for postcards and standard letters are 8 DKK within Denmark (27 DKK if you want it to go quickly and can post it at a post office rather than in a mailbox), 25 DKK to Europe and all other countries (as of 2017, the rates are higher and likely to rise, but as any current info as of the time of writing is likely to be outdated soon, do ask at the post office).\n</p><p>If you need to have parcels or mail sent to you in Denmark, you can receive it as <i>Poste Restante</i> at most major post offices (General Delivery in the US). The post office will only hold such mail in one month, after which it will be returned to the sender. The address format is:\n</p>\n<pre>Name\nc/o Poste restante\nHovedpostkontoret (<i>General Postoffice</i>)\nPostal-Code City\nDenmark\n</pre>\n<p>Major international parcel services like UPS or Fedex, while present in Denmark, do not offer any holding service.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cope\">Cope</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=56\" title=\"Edit section: Cope\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Consular_assistance\">Consular assistance</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=57\" title=\"Edit section: Consular assistance\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Nearly all developed nations have embassies in Copenhagen, and most other countries have embassies in either Stockholm or Copenhagen responsible for consular services to the whole <a href=\"/en/Scandinavia\" title=\"Scandinavia\">Scandinavian</a> region.

Many attribute this to the high equality not only being present in practice, but also mentally - \"you are not worth any more than me, so why should I treat you any different\". By and large it is just one of those cultural differences you have deal with while visiting another country, and throwing a hissy fit or demanding to speak to the supervisor, is unlikely to get you anywhere. On the upside; tipping is neither expected - nor required, and when you <i>do</i> bump into good service, it tends to be truly genuine helpfulness, rather than an expectation for tips, or employee training courses - so savour such moments, remember to tip, and forget about the rest.\n</p><p>On a practical level, this means that you should only expect table service in restaurants. In caf\u00e9's and bars you usually order in the bar or counter and pay immediately when ordering, even if you intend for a 2nd order. It is also common that staff doing other duties than serving customers will happily keep the customer waiting, until he or she is finished with with whatever needs doing. Also don't expect any sir or madam's, verbal bromides seems awkward to most Danes, including those behind a counter.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Media\">Media</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Denmark&amp;action=edit&amp;section=59\" title=\"Edit section: Media\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Apart from children's programmes, nothing gets dubbed into Danish, although a sizeable portion of broadcasts in Denmark are American and British productions - so even with no English channels, there will usually be something shown in a comprehensible language, same goes for cinemas - so you should be safe for a lazy rainy day.

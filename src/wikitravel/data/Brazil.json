Settling by the Portuguese began late in the 16th century, with the extraction of valuable wood from the <i>pau brasil</i> tree, from which the country draws its name. Brazil was settled by the Portuguese and not the Spanish, as were the rest of Central, South and parts of North America in the New World. Despite Portuguese rule, in some parts of Brazil the Dutch founded colonies between 1630 and 1654. They founded several cities, such as Mauritsville (now <a href=\"/en/Recife\" title=\"Recife\">Recife</a>, capital of the state of <a href=\"/en/Pernambuco\" title=\"Pernambuco\">Pernambuco</a>, at the edge of North-East of the country), and many sugar cane plantations. The Dutch fought a grim jungle war with the Portuguese, and without the support of the Republic of their homeland due to a war with England, the Dutch surrendered to the Portuguese, though they did not officially recognize Portuguese rule, which led to an all-out war with Portugal off the coast of Portugal in 1656. In 1665 the Peace Treaty of The Hague was signed, Portugal lost its Asian colonies and had to pay 63 tons of gold to compensate the Dutch Republic for the loss of its colony.\n</p><p>Brazil became the centre of the Portuguese Empire by 1808, when the King Dom Jo\u00e3o VI (John VI) fled from Napoleon's invasion of Portugal and established himself and his government in the city of <a href=\"/en/Rio_de_Janeiro\" title=\"Rio de Janeiro\">Rio de Janeiro</a>.\n</p><p>The following centuries saw further exploitation of the country's natural riches such as gold and rubber, alongside the rise of an economy based largely on sugar, coffee and African slave labour. Meanwhile, extermination and Christianizing of natives kept its pace, and in the 19th and 20th centuries a second wave of immigration took place, mainly Italian, German (in southern Brazil), Spanish, Japanese (in S\u00e3o Paulo and Paran\u00e1 states), American (in S\u00e3o Paulo state), and Portuguese, making Brazilian culture and society complex and unique.\n</p><p>Following three centuries under the rule of Portugal, Brazil became an independent nation on September 7th, 1822. Until 1889 Brazil was an Empire under the rule of Dom Pedro I and his son Dom Pedro II. By this time, it became an emerging international power.\n</p><p>But during these three and a half centuries, Brazil was the nation in the Americas with the most widespread slavery, the first to bring African people to work by force, and the last to set them free. Due to English laws against slavery (some argue more for economic contests than humanity reasons) and fighting between white and black people, slaves and free, for abolition, slavery ended in 1888. But freedom didn't mean equality to the now-free black people and their descendants.\n</p><p>By far the largest and most populous country in Latin America, it has also overcome more than two decades (1964-1985) of military dictatorship that imprisoned, exiled, tortured, and murdered potential opponents, most of them innocent civilians. These dark times are known as \"Os Anos de Chumbo\" (Years of Lead). Only recently, with the establishment of a National Truth Commission (2011), has the nation begun to face the human rights abuses that accompanied the U.S.-supported coup that overthrew democratically-elected Jo\u00e3o Goulart in 1964. Brazil has returned to democratic rule, while facing the challenge of keeping its industrial and agricultural growth and developing its interior. Exploiting vast natural resources and a large labor pool, Brazil is a Latin America economic power and a regional leader. Brazil has high rates of crime, income inequality and systemic, centuries-old corruption. Despite it the people try to remain happy and festive.\n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Culture\">Culture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Culture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:392px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Roda_de_capoeira1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Roda_de_capoeira1.jpg/390px-Roda_de_capoeira1.jpg\" width=\"390\" height=\"238\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Roda_de_capoeira1.jpg/585px-Roda_de_capoeira1.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2c/Roda_de_capoeira1.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"700\" data-file-height=\"427\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Roda_de_capoeira1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Capoeiristas <a href=\"/en/Porto_Alegre\" title=\"Porto Alegre\">Porto Alegre</a></div></div></div>\n<p>Owing to Brazil\u2019s continental dimensions, varied geography, history and people, the country\u2019s culture is rich and diverse. It has huge regional variations (even among neighbouring States sometimes) and in spite of being mostly unified by a single language, some regions and States are so different from each other that they look like different countries altogether.\n</p><p><b>Music</b> plays an important part in Brazilian identity. Styles like <i>choro</i>, <i>samba</i> and <i>Bossa nova</i> are considered genuinely Brazilian. <i>Caipira</i> music is also in the roots of <i>sertanejo</i>, the national equivalent to country music. MPB stands for Brazilian Popular Music, which mixes several national styles under a single concept. <i>Forr\u00f3</i>, a north-eastern happy dancing music style, has also become common nationwide. New urban styles include <i>funk</i> - name given to a dance music genre from Rio's <i>favelas</i> that mixes heavy electronic beats and often raunchy rapping - and <i>techno-brega</i>, a crowd-pleaser in northern states, that fuses romantic pop, dance music and caribbean rhythms. Brazilian funk is the most popular type of music they listen to. It has a constant and repeated beat that is always the same, it never changes. They keep the beat, and sing songs to it. There are more than 1000 songs that are funk. You might think that people get tired of the same beat, but no. It is so impressive that there are so many songs that it never gets old. Funk could be considered tradition because of its strength in rhythm, and bringing people together.\n</p><p>A mixture of martial arts, dance, music and game, <b>capoeira</b> was created by African slaves brought to Brazil, mainly from Portuguese <a href=\"/en/Angola\" title=\"Angola\">Angola</a>. Distinguished by vivacious complicated movements and accompanying music, it can be seen and practiced in many Brazilian cities. \n</p><p>In the classical music, Neoclassic Period is particularly notable, due to the works of composers like Heitor Villa-Lobos and Camargo Guarnieri, who created a typical Brazilian school, mixing elements of the traditional European music to the Brazilian rhythms, while other composers like Cl\u00e1udio Santoro followed the guidelines of the Second School of Vienna. In the Romantic Period, the greatest name was Antonio Carlos Gomes, author of some Italian-styled operas with typical Brazilian themes, like <i>Il Guarany</i> and <i>Lo Schiavo</i>. In the Classical Period, the most prominent name is Jos\u00e9 Maur\u00edcio Nunes Garcia, a priest who wrote both sacred and secular music and was very influenced by the Viennese classical style of the 18th and early 19th century.\n</p><p><b>Candomble</b> and <b>Umbanda</b> are religions with African roots that have survived prejudice and persecution and still have a significant following in Brazil. Their places of cult are called <i>terreiros</i> and many are open to visit.\n</p><p><b>Indigenous</b> traits can be found especially in North Region, from cuisine to vocabulary. There are still many indigenous groups and tribes living in North, although many have been deeply influenced by Western culture, and several of the country's surviving indigenous languages are endangered. The traditional lifestyle and graphic expressions of the Waj\u00e3pi indigenous group from the state of <a href=\"/en/Amap%C3%A1\" title=\"Amap\u00e1\">Amap\u00e1</a> were proclaimed a <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/masterpiece.php?id=54&amp;lg=en\">Masterpiece of the World's Intangible Heritage</a> by UNESCO.\n</p><p>Globo, the largest national television network, also plays an important role in shaping national identity and public opinion. Nine out of ten households have a TV set, which is the most important source of information and entertainment for most Brazilians, followed by the radio broadcast. TVs broadcast sports, movies, local and national news and <b>telenovelas</b> (soap operas)\u2013 6-10 month-long series that have become one of the country\u2019s main cultural exports.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"People\">People</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: People\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Throughout its history, Brazil has welcomed several different peoples and practices. Brazil constitutes a melting pot of the most diverse ethnic groups thus mitigating ethnic prejudices and preventing racial conflicts, though long-lasting slavery and genocide among indigenous populations have taken their toll. Prejudice is sneaky since this matter is taboo in Brazil, and more directed towards different social classes than between races. Nevertheless, race, or simply skin colour, is still a dividing factor in Brazilian society and you will notice the skin typically darkens as the social class gets lower: wealthy upper-class people are almost all white; a few middle-class are mulato (mixed race) and even black; and the majority of poor people are black - except in South Region because blacks and mulatos compose less than 10% of its population. Nowadays, however, Afro-Brazilians and Amerindian populations are increasingly aware of their civil rights and of their rich cultural heritage, and social mobility is achievable through education.\n</p><p>In general, Brazilians are a fun-loving people. While Southerners may be somewhat colder and more reserved, from Rio upwards people usually boast a captivating attitude towards life and truly enjoy having a good time. Some may even tell you that beer, football, samba, barbecue and woman is all they could crave for. \n</p><p>Friendship and hospitality are highly praised traits, and family and social connections are strongly valued. To people they have met, or at least know by name, Brazilians are usually very open, friendly and sometimes quite generous. Once introduced, until getting a good reason not to, a typical Brazilian may treat you as warmly as he would treat a best friend.  Brazilians are reputedly one of the most hospitable people in the world and foreigners are usually treated with respect and often with true admiration. \n</p><p>Attitudes towards foreigners may also be subject to some difference treatment: In most of cities, anyone talking, acting or looking like a tourist (even other Brazilians!) could be charged higher prices, such as in parking lots, in restaurants, open malls, etc. \n</p><p>Brazilians seems to be genuinely friendly, but many are used to small acts of corruption in their everyday lives, the so-called <i>jeitinho brasileiro</i> (\"Brazilian Way\"). Rio de Janeiro people brag about their ability to outsmart people (especially from other countries and Brazilian States) and even nicknamed their State <i>Terra de Malandro</i> (Weasel Land). If you obviously look like a tourist, you are a potential target; for instance, a vendor may try to sell goods at higher prices, or a taxi driver may choose the longest route to the destination. It doesn't mean that you can't trust anyone, just that you have to be a bit more alert and careful, particularly if someone seems <i>too friendly</i>. Notice in some States people call everyone \"friend\" no matter the degree of intimacy they have to each other, merely as good manners.\n</p><p>Whereas the \"Western\" roots of Brazilian culture are largely European, especially Iberian, as evidenced by its colonial towns and even sporadic historic buildings between the skyscrapers, there has been a strong tendency in recent decades to adopt a more \"American way of life\" which is found in urban culture and architecture, mass media, consumerism and a strongly positive feeling towards technical progress. In spite of that, Brazil is still a nation faced towards the Atlantic, not towards Hispanic America.\n</p><p>Brazilians <b>are not Hispanic</b>. Some may be offended if a visitor openly says that, or tends to believe that Brazilians have Spanish as a primary or secondary language, visitors will receive a warmer welcome if they try to start conversations in Portuguese, but even if the visitor speaks Spanish towards Brazilians, they're likely to answer in Portuguese.\n</p><p>The contrasts in this huge country equally fascinates and shocks most visitors, especially Europeans, as well as the indifference of many locals towards the social, economic and ecological problems. Whereas an emerging elite of young, well-educated professionals indulge in amenities of modern society, child labor, illiteracy and subhuman housing conditions still exist even in regions blessed by economic growth and huge foreign investments such as <a href=\"/en/S%C3%A3o_Paulo\" title=\"S\u00e3o Paulo\">S\u00e3o Paulo</a> or <a href=\"/en/Rio_de_Janeiro\" title=\"Rio de Janeiro\">Rio</a>.\n</p><p>As much as Brazilians acknowledge their self-sustainability in raw materials, agriculture, and energy sources as an enormous benefit for the future, most of them agree that without huge efforts in education there will hardly be a way out of poverty and underdevelopment.\n</p><p>Since the beginning of the 21st century, Brazil has faced an increasing wave of immigration from <a href=\"/en/China\" title=\"China\">China</a>, <a href=\"/en/Bolivia\" title=\"Bolivia\">Bolivia</a>, <a href=\"/en/Colombia\" title=\"Colombia\">Colombia</a>, <a href=\"/en/Peru\" title=\"Peru\">Peru</a>, <a href=\"/en/Nigeria\" title=\"Nigeria\">Nigeria</a>, <a href=\"/en/Haiti\" title=\"Haiti\">Haiti</a> and <a href=\"/en/Angola\" title=\"Angola\">Angola</a>.

The weather constantly changes and is sometimes a surprise. It can be scorching hot, then simmer down, and get very cold. It could be sunny 1 minute, and start raining the second minute. The warm climate is perfect for the beach and playing outside.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Holidays_and_working_hours\">Holidays and working hours</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Holidays and working hours\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Brazil observes the following 13 <b>national holidays</b>: \n</p>\n<ul><li>New Year - 1 January  </li>\n<li>Carnival  - February/March (Movable - 7 weeks before Easter.

Banks open Monday to Friday, 10:00-16:00. Street shops tend to close at noon on Saturday and only re-open on Monday. Shopping malls normally open 10:00-22:00, Monday to Saturday, and 15:00-21:00 on Sundays. Some malls, especially in large cities, are also open on Sundays, although not all the stores may be open. It is also possible to find 24-hour stores and small markets that are open even on Sundays.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Electricity\">Electricity</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Electricity\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Brazil is one of a few countries that uses both 110 and 220 volts for everyday appliances.  Expect the voltage to change back and forth as you travel from one place to the next -- even within the same Brazilian state, sometimes even within the same building. There is no physical difference in the electric outlets (power mains) for the two voltages.\n</p><p>Although Brazil has its own type of electric outlet, almost nobody uses it. Electric outlets usually accept both flat (North American), and round (European) plugs. Otherwise adaptors from flat blades to round pins are easy to find in any supermarket or hardware shop. Some outlets are too narrow for the German \"Schuko\" plugs. The best makeshift solution is to buy a cheap T-connection and just force your \"Schuko\" in, -the T will break, but it will work. Very few outlets have a grounding point, and some might not accept newer North American polarized plugs, where one pin is slightly larger. Again, use the cheap T. Near the border with <a href=\"/en/Argentina\" title=\"Argentina\">Argentina</a>, you might occasionally find outlets for the Australia/New Zealand-type plug. If crossing the border, you'll probably need this adapter as well.\n</p><p>In 2009/2010, the <b>IEC 60906-1</b> was introduced to Brazil and some newer buildings already have it. It is backwards compatible with the Europlug, but it has a receded socket. Again, T-plugs can be used as adapters for other common formats.\n</p><p>Frequency is 60Hz, which may disturb 50Hz electric clocks. Blackouts are less and less frequent, but you always run a risk at peak of high season in small tourist towns.\n</p><p><i>See also: <b><a href=\"/en/Travel_topics\" title=\"Travel topics\">Travel topics</a></b></i> -- <a href=\"/en/Electrical_systems\" title=\"Electrical systems\">Electrical systems</a>\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7\" title=\"Edit section: Regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:602px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:BrazilMap.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/43/BrazilMap.png/600px-BrazilMap.png\" width=\"600\" height=\"543\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/43/BrazilMap.png/900px-BrazilMap.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/4/43/BrazilMap.png/1200px-BrazilMap.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"1994\" data-file-height=\"1803\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:BrazilMap.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Regions of Brazil</div></div></div>\n<p>Brazil is the fifth largest country on earth.

Note that the immigration officer has the right to restrict your visa to less than 90 days, if he deems fit. (This has been done routinely for lone male travellers arriving in <a href=\"/en/Fortaleza\" title=\"Fortaleza\">Fortaleza</a>, allegedly to combat prostitution tourism.) He will then state the number of days (e.g. 60 or 30) in pen writing inside the stamp just given in your passport; if not, it remains as 90 days.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Citizens from all other countries (complete list <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.portalconsular.mre.gov.br/antes/quadro-geral-de-regime-de-vistos-1\">[1]</a>) do require a visa.  The fees vary depending on reciprocity: for example, US citizens have to pay US$160 for a tourist or business visa. As of February 2015, citizens of Canada should expect to pay at least CDN$97.50 for a tourist visa, not including any handling or processing fees. Cost of Brazil visa for citizens of Taiwan or Taiwanese passport holder pay $20 (Reference from Embassy of Brazil in Lima, Peru) and 5 days to process. The reciprocity, however, also frequently applies to visa validity: US citizens can be granted visas valid up to 10 years and, likewise, Canadian citizens for up to 5.\n<ul><li>Note: As of 2018, citizens of Canada, Japan, Australia, and the USA (from 28 January 2018) can apply for an electronic tourist visa<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://vfsglobal.com/brazil-evisa/\">[2]</a>. This electronic visa is valid for multiple entries within two years and stays of up to 90 days in a one-year period and costs USD 45. </li></ul></li></ul>\n<ul><li> The visa process is particularly tedious for US citizens, because Brazil has a reciprocal visa policy with all countries, and special attention should be paid. There are several consulates in the country but you MUST apply to the consulate that covers your jurisdiction. You must submit a copy of your ID or a utility bill as proof of residence even if that is not listed anywhere. Visa sections do not accept telephone calls and you may have to email them in advance to clarify any specific situation. For a tourist visa, you MUST submit a copy of your plane ticket or reservation, a photo, and your signature. As of Dec 2015, you need to upload the photo and the signature online and the files must have specific sizes. The photo needs to have a 1.5 x 2 ratio or it would not upload. Each consulate will list the processing time, unless there is a life-or-death emergency, they would not process your application sooner than stated. The consulate would not even notify an applicant if documents are missing. If you do not have all the documents, your application will be denied, fee will be charged, and processing time starts from 0. Apply 2 to 3 months in advance or go in person if possible.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Tourist visas (including those granted on the spot in immigration control, as for most Europeans) can be extended at any office of the <i>Policia Federal</i>. All state capitals, and most border towns and international ports have one. Tourist visas only be extended once, for a maximum of 90 days, and under no circumstances can you be granted more than 180 days with a tourist visa for any 365-day period. You should contact the federal police about 1 week before your visa expires. The handling fee is currently R$ 67 (Oct. 2008). You may be asked for an outbound ticket (book <b>a fully refundable</b> one on the internet, then cancel when your visa is extended), and a proof of subsistance (for which your credit card is mostly accepted.) In order to apply for the extension, you must fill out the Emiss\u00e3o da Guia de Recolhimento on the Federal Police website, which you will carry to the Banco do Brasil in order to pay the fee. Do not pay the fee until you have spoken with a federal police officer about your case. If she/he denies the extension of your visa, you must have a bank account in Brazil in order to receive a refund.</li></ul>\n<div class=\"floatright\"><a href=\"/en/File:Stampbrazil.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Stampbrazil.jpg\" src=\"/upload/en/thumb/e/ef/Stampbrazil.jpg/300px-Stampbrazil.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"168\" srcset=\"/upload/en/e/ef/Stampbrazil.jpg 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"417\" data-file-height=\"233\" /></a></div>\n<ul><li>The requirement to first enter Brazil within 90 days of the issue of a visa now only applies to nationals of Angola, Bahrain, Burma, Cambodia, Cape Verde, China, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Greece, Honduras, Indonesia, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Kuwait, Laos, Libya, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Paraguay, The Philippines, Portugal, Qatar, Syria, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, and Tunisia. <b>Failure to enter Brazil within 90 days will invalidate the visa, no matter how long it is otherwise valid for.</b></li></ul>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Entry vs. exit stamps</b><br />\nImmediately after your passport is stamped by the Brazilian Federal Police, ensure that the last number on the right-end of the stamp is an odd number. A number 1 (air)/3 (boat)/5 (car/bus) indicates that you entered the country and a number 2/4/6 indicates that you exited. Some federal police officers have mistakenly given foreigners the even number stamp upon entering. If you have the even number stamp and try to extend the visa in a city that is not your port of entry, you will be told to return to the city where you received the incorrect stamp so that it may be corrected before you can receive the extension.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<ul><li> By law you are required to produce your outbound ticket upon entry, but this is only enforced in exceptional cases. Even if you are asked, you could often get away with explaining that you are taking the bus to Argentina, and couldn't buy the ticket in, say, Europe.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> If you overstay your tourist visa, you will be fined R$8.28 per day (as of October 2007), for a maximum of 100 days. This means that even if you stay illegally for 5 years, the fine will never exceed R$828. You will be made to pay this at the border crossing. As this can take time, it could be wise to do it a few days up front at a federal police office, especially if you have a domestic to international flight connection. The federal police will then give you 8 days to get out of the country. If you don't pay your fine upon exiting, you will have to pay the next time you enter. The fact that you have been fined for overstaying in the past does not normally imply future difficulties with immigration, but you'd better keep all receipts and old passports for reference. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> If you want to enter/exit the country for some reason without coming in contact with the immigration authorities, there are numerous tiny border towns that have virtually no control. You will perhaps be told by the local police (who don't have stamps or computer registers for immigration) to contact the federal police in such and such nearby town.</li></ul>\n<ul><li>When you are travelling from certain tropical regions to Brazil you need a yellow fever vaccination and the certificate showing you had this.

A typical 4-ticket pass starts at around US$580 while a full 9 tickets will run around US$1150. In addition, Gol also offers a cheaper flight pass good for travel only within the <a href=\"/en/Northeast_(Brazil)\" title=\"Northeast (Brazil)\">Northeast</a> of the country. These passes can only be obtained before arrival in the country, and you must prove that you have already purchased international return trip tickets or tickets for onward travel.\n</p>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p><br />\nAir service covers most of Brazil. Note that many flights make many stops en route, particularly in hubs as S\u00e3o Paulo or Brasilia. Most airports with regular passenger traffic are operated by the federal <i>Infraero</i>.<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.infraero.gov.br\">[13]</a>. They have a very convenient website, with an English version. It lists all the airlines operating at each airport, and also has updated flight schedules.\n</p><p>There are now several Brazilian booking engines that are good (although not perfect) for comparing flights and prices between different companies. They will mostly include an extra fee, hence it is cheaper to book on the airline's own site. \n</p><p>The Brazilian airline scene completely changed at least twice over the last 10 years or so. The largest carriers are now LATAM <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.latam.com.br\">[14]</a> and Gol <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.voegol.com.br\">[15]</a>, which share more than 80% of the domestic market between them. The traditional Varig is now just another brand of Gol. Others include WebJet <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.webjet.com.br\">[16]</a>, Avianca <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.avianca.com.br\">[17]</a>, and Azul <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.voeazul.com.br\">[18]</a>. TRIP <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.voetrip.com.br/\">[19]</a> has short-haul flights to smaller airports throughout the country, and Pantanal <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.voepantanal.com.br/\">[20]</a> and  Puma <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.pumaair.com.br/\">[21]</a> are growing in the same segment. Portuguese TAP <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.flytap.com\">[22]</a> has a few domestic code shares with TAM. There are also a number of regional companies, such as NHT <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.voenht.com.br/#\">[23]</a>(<a href=\"/en/Rio_Grande_do_Sul\" title=\"Rio Grande do Sul\">Rio Grande do Sul</a> and <a href=\"/en/Santa_Catarina\" title=\"Santa Catarina\">Santa Catarina</a>). Price differences, at least if a ticket is purchased on the internet well in advance, are so small that it's rather meaningless to call any of these \"low cost\", although WebJet and Azul have lately been a notch cheaper for domestic flights. \n</p><p>Booking on the domestic carriers' sites can be frustrating for non-Brazilian citizens.  Often, you will be asked for your CPF (national identity number) while paying by credit card. Even if you -as a foreigner- have a CPF, the sites will often not recognize it. Gol now accepts international cards, but the system is buggy (Oct.2010). One trick that might work is to visit one of the airlines' foreign websites, although prices may vary. Many flights can also be found on foreign booking engines where no CPF is needed. If you book weeks in advance, most carriers will give you the option to pay by bank deposit (<i>boleto banc\u00e1rio</i>), which is actually payable by cash not only in banks, but also in a number of supermarkets, pharmacies and other stores. Buying a ticket at a travel agent is generally R$ 30 more expensive, noting that certain special offers only can be found online.\n</p><p>Be aware that many domestic flights have so many stops that some, including yours, may be missing from the listings in the airports. Double check your flight number and confirm with ground staff. \n</p><p>Certain domestic flights in Brazil are \"international\", meaning that the flight has arrived from abroad and is continuing without clearing all passengers through customs and immigration. This means ALL passengers must do this at the next stop, even those having boarded in Brazil. Do NOT fill out a new immigration form, but show what you were given upon actual arrival to Brazil.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car_2\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes_1.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes_1.jpg/250px-Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes_1.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes_1.jpg/375px-Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes_1.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes_1.jpg/500px-Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes_1.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2048\" data-file-height=\"1536\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Rodovia_dos_Imigrantes_1.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The SP-160, or Rodovia dos Imigrantes</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:BR116_Viaduto_em_Fortaleza.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/BR116_Viaduto_em_Fortaleza.jpg/250px-BR116_Viaduto_em_Fortaleza.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"240\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/BR116_Viaduto_em_Fortaleza.jpg/375px-BR116_Viaduto_em_Fortaleza.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/BR116_Viaduto_em_Fortaleza.jpg/500px-BR116_Viaduto_em_Fortaleza.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1065\" data-file-height=\"1023\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:BR116_Viaduto_em_Fortaleza.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>BR-116 in <a href=\"/en/Cear%C3%A1\" title=\"Cear\u00e1\">Cear\u00e1</a>.</div></div></div>\n<p>Brazil has the largest road network in Latin America with over 1.6 million kilometres. A car is a good idea if you want to explore scenic areas, e.g. the historic cities of Minas Gerais, the Rio-Santos highway, or the beaches in North-East Brazil. There are the usual car rental companies at the airports. \n</p><p>Many roads are in good condition, especially in the east and south of the country and along the coast. In other areas and outside the metropolitan regions there are also gravel and dirt roads for which an off-road vehicle can be strongly recommended. This especially applies to the Amazon area where many roads are difficult or not at all passable during the rainy season from November to March. This is why it is advisable to travel with a good map and to be well informed about distances, road conditions and the estimated travel time. Road maps of the brand <i>Guia 4 Rodas</i> (can be bought from most newsstands in Brazil) provide not only maps and distances but also information about current conditions of the roads. <i>Cochera andina</i> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.latino-cars.com/\">[24]</a> publishes useful information on almost 300 routes in the country. In theory, the driving rules of Brazil resemble those of Western Europe or North American. In practice, driving in Brazil can be quite scary if you are used to European (even Mediterranean) or North American road culture, due to widespread violations of driving rules, and the toleration thereof.\n</p><p>Distances kept to other vehicles are kept at a bare minimum, overtaking whenever close to possible, and changing lanes without much of a prior signal. Many large cities also suffer from hold-ups when you wait at a red light in the night. Even if there is no risk of robbery, many drivers (including of city buses) run red lights or stop signs at night when they do not see incoming traffic from the cross street. Drivers also indulge in \"creative\" methods of saving time, such as using the reverse direction lanes. In rural areas, many domestic animals are left at the roadside, and they sometimes wanders into the traffic. Pedestrians take enormous chances crossing the road, since many drivers do not bother to slow down if they see pedestrians crossing. The quality of the paving is very varied, and the presence of enormous potholes is something that strongly discourages night-driving. Also consider the risk of highway hold-ups after dark, not to mention truck drivers on amphetamines (to keep awake for days in a row).\n</p>\n<ul><li> In Brazil cars are driven on the right hand side of the road.</li>\n<li> A flashing left signal means that the car ahead is warning you not to pass, for some reason. If the car ahead of you wants to show you that it is safe to pass it will flash the right signal. The right signal is the same signal to indicate that you're going to stop on the side of the road, so it means you're going to slow down. On the other hand the left signal is the same signal to indicate you're going to pass the car ahead, meaning you're going to speed up.</li>\n<li> Flashing, twinkling headlights from the cars coming on the opposite side of the road means caution on the road ahead. Most of the time, it indicates that there are animals, cops or speed radar ahead.</li>\n<li> Keep the doors locked when driving, especially in the larger cities, as robberies at stop signs and red lights are quite common in some areas. You'll make it much easier for the robber if he can simply open up the door and sit down. Be equally careful with keeping your windows wide open, as someone might put their hands inside your car and steal a wallet, for instance.

The bus terminal (<i>rodovi\u00e1ria</i>) in cities play a role akin to train stations in many countries. You should check travel distance and time while traveling within Brazil, going from Rio de Janeiro to the south region could take more than 24 hours, so it may worth going by plane if you can afford it.\n</p><p>Brazil has a very good long distance bus network. Basically, any city of more than 100,000 people will have direct lines to the nearest few state capitals, and also to other large cities within the same range. Pretty much any little settlement has public transport of some kind (a lorry, perhaps) to the nearest real bus station. \n</p><p>Mostly you have to go to the bus station to buy a ticket, although most major bus companies make reservations and sell tickets by internet with the requirement that you pick up your ticket sometime in advance. In a few cities you can also buy a ticket on the phone and have it delivered to your hotel for an extra charge of some 3-5 reais. Some companies have also adopted the airlines' genius policy of pricing: In a few cases buying early can save you more than 50%. The facility of flagging a bus and hopping on (if there are no available seats you will have to stand, still paying full price) is widespread in the country. This is less likely to work along a few routes where armed robberies have happened frequently, such as those leading to the border with <a href=\"/en/Paraguay\" title=\"Paraguay\">Paraguay</a> and to <a href=\"/en/Foz_do_Igua%C3%A7u\" title=\"Foz do Igua\u00e7u\">Foz do Igua\u00e7u</a>.\n</p><p>There is no one bus company that serves the whole country, so you need to identify the company that connect two cities in particular by calling the bus station of one city. ANTT, the national authority for land transportation, has a search engine <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"https://appweb.antt.gov.br/transp/secao_duas_localidades.asp\">[28]</a> (in Portuguese) for all available domestic bus lines. Be aware that some big cities like S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio have more than one bus station, each one covering certain cities around. It is good to check in advance to which bus station you are going.\nAnother website which you can check the time, prices and buy tickets online is BuscaOnibus <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.buscaonibus.com.br/\">[29]</a>. Many times you need a CPF number to buy tickets, but recently BrasilbyBus and ClickBus now cater to tourist without the CPF number.\n</p><p>Bus services are often sold in three classes: Regular, Executive and First-Class (<i>Leito</i>, in Portuguese). Regular may or may not have air conditioning. For long distances or overnight travels, Executive offers more space and a folding board to support your legs. First-Class has even more space and only three seats per row, making enough space to sleep comfortably. Cheaper seats sometimes sell out fast, so it is worth making the trip early to the Rodoviaria or buy online.\n</p><p>All trips of more than 4 hours are covered by buses with bathrooms and the buses stop for food/bathrooms at least once every 4 hours of travel.\n</p><p>Brazilian bus stations, known as <i>rodovi\u00e1ria</i> or <i>terminal rodovi\u00e1rio</i>, tend to be located away from city centers. They are often in pretty sketchy areas, so if you travel at night be prepared to take a taxi to/from the station. There will also be local bus lines.\n</p><p>Even if you have a valid ticket bought from elsewhere, some Brazilian bus stations may also require a boarding card. This can be obtained from the bus company, often for a supplement fee. If you buy a ticket in the departure bus station you will also be given this boarding card.\n</p><p><i>Rodovi\u00e1rias</i> include many services, including fast-food restaurants, caf\u00e9s, Internet caf\u00e9s, toilets and left luggage. As a general rule, the larger the city, the more expensive the services (e.g. leaving a suitcase as left luggage in a smaller city may cost 1 R$, but in Recife in might cost you 5 R$).\n</p><p>When buying tickets, as well as when boarding the bus, you may be asked for proof of ID. Brazilian federal law requires this for interstate transportation. Not all conductors know how to read foreign passports, so be prepared to show them that the name of the passport truly is the same as the name on the ticket.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_city_bus\">By city bus</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: By city bus\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most cities have extensive bus services. Multiple companies may serve a single city. There is almost never a map of the bus lines, and often bus stops are unmarked. Be prepared for confusion and wasted time.\n</p><p>Buses have a board behind the windshield that advertises the main destinations they serve. You may have to ask the locals for information, but they may not know bus lines except the ones they usually take.\n</p><p>In most cities you have to wave to stop the bus when you want to take it. This in itself would no pose a problem, however, in big cities there may be dozens of bus lines stopping at a given bus stop and bus stops are not designed to accommodate so many vehicles.\nFrequently one cannot observe the oncoming buses due to other buses blocking the view. Bus drivers are reluctant to slow down for a bus stop if they are not sure someone will take their bus, so it is common to miss your bus because you could not see it coming to\nwave on time or the driver did not see you waving in between buses already at the stop. Some people go into the middle of a busy street to wait for their bus to make sure they see it and the driver sees them. In some places, like Manaus, drivers even tend to ignore stop requests (both to get on and to get off) if it is not too easy to navigate to the bus stop.\n</p><p>Most city buses have both a driver and a conductor. The conductor sits behind a till next to a turnstile. You have to pay the conductor, the price of the bus is usually advertised on the windshield. The turnstiles are narrow, and very inconvenient if one carries any kind of load (try balancing a heavy backpack over the turnstile while the bus is running). Larger buses often have a front section, before the turnstile, meant in priority for the elderly, handicapped and pregnant women - you can use it but you still have to pay! Typical prices are around R$ 3,00.\n</p><p>You can try asking the conductor to warn you when the bus is close to your destination. Depending on whether he or she understands you and feels like helping you, you may get help.\n</p><p>In addition to large city buses, there are often minibuses or minivans (<i>alternativo</i>). You pay the driver when you go aboard.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_boat_2\">By boat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=24\" title=\"Edit section: By boat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In the Amazon region as well as on the coast west of Sao Luis, boat travel is often the only way to get around.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Talk\">Talk</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: Talk\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<table class=\"pp_infobox\" style=\"float:right; clear:right;margin-left: 1em; width:40%;\" cellpadding=\"8\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"0\">\n\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\" width=\"100%\" style=\"background-color:#f3f3ff; border:1px solid blue; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em\">\n<p><b>Non-verbal communication</b><br />\n</p><p>Brazilians use a lot of gestures in informal communication, and the meaning of certain words or expressions may be influenced by them.\n</p>\n<ul><li> The <i>thumbs up</i> gesture is used to mean <i>everything's OK</i>, <i>yes</i> or even <i>thanks</i>.

Indeed, Brazil has had immigrants from all parts of the world for centuries, whose descendants now speak Portuguese as their mother tongue.   \n</p><p>Brazilian Portuguese has a number of pronunciation differences with that spoken in <a href=\"/en/Portugal\" title=\"Portugal\">Portugal</a> (and within, between the regions there are some quite extreme accent and slang differences), but speakers of either can understand each other.  However, European Portuguese (Luso) is more difficult for Brazilians to understand than the reverse, as many Brazilian television programs are shown in Portugal. Notice that a few words can have a totally different meaning in Brazil and Portugal, usually slang words. An example of this is \"Rapariga\" which in Portugal means young girl, and in Brazil means a prostitute. \n</p><p><b>English</b> is not widely spoken except in some touristy areas. Don't expect bus or taxi drivers to understand English, so it may be a good idea to write down the address you are heading to before getting the cab. In most big and luxurious hotels, it is very likely that the taxi fleet will speak some English.\n</p><p><b>Spanish</b> has some similarity with Portuguese. Brazilian tourists are able to make basic questions and give basic answers when visiting Spain or other Latin American countries and vice-versa. Of course such communication is quite awkward (mainly due to tilded vowels and semivowelization of 'e' and 'o' when being the last vowel of a Portuguese word), so take a phrase book and be prepared for slow communication with a lot of interpretive gestures.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See\">See</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: See\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#See\" title=\"click to add a see listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '26', 'see', 'Brazil');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Natural_wonders\">Natural wonders</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=27\" title=\"Edit section: Natural wonders\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Mata_Atlantica,_Bahia,_Brasil.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Mata_Atlantica%2C_Bahia%2C_Brasil.jpg/250px-Mata_Atlantica%2C_Bahia%2C_Brasil.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Mata_Atlantica%2C_Bahia%2C_Brasil.jpg/375px-Mata_Atlantica%2C_Bahia%2C_Brasil.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Mata_Atlantica%2C_Bahia%2C_Brasil.jpg/500px-Mata_Atlantica%2C_Bahia%2C_Brasil.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3264\" data-file-height=\"2448\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Mata_Atlantica,_Bahia,_Brasil.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mata Atlantica, Bahia</div></div></div>\n<ul><li> <b>Amazon Rainforest</b> - The Amazon River Basin holds more than half of the world's remaining rainforest, and over 60% of that lies within the <a href=\"/en/North_(Brazil)\" title=\"North (Brazil)\">North</a> of Brazil &#8212; approximately one billion acres with incredible biodiversity.

They all gather flowers to give to the sea as originally the local african groups thought it would please the goddess of the sea, which means they set the flowers on the water and let it float away to where ever the current will take it. These are usually white flowers with a green stem and green leaves. It is a custom that the flowers should be white as the clothing. Some people nest the flowers in a small fishing boat and some simply drop the leaves on the water. It is said this tradition have been constant since it first started.

One real is divided into 100 centavos. As an example of how prices are written, R$1,50 means one real and fifty centavos.\n</p><p>Be careful using credit cards at taxis, gas stations, newsstands and small outlets. Their owners aren't so careful about checking employees and technicians who perform maintenance on card machines, so many people have their cards compromised and then over several days have money siphoned off their cards. A safer option is to use cash for small expenses (so you don't need to carry too much - just make sure you only withdraw from bank ATMs) and to go to bigger stores with multiple machines since their managers use to enforce security and checking protocols to prevent scammers from compromising card machines (gas station franchises being a sad exception). If you choose to use your credit card, keep an eye on your statement.\n</p><p>Travellers' checks can be hard to cash anywhere that does not offer currency exchange. Foreign currency such as US Dollars or Euros can be exchanged at major airports and luxury hotels (although at bad rates), exchange bureaus and major branches of some banks, where you need your passport and your immigration form.\n</p><p>Look for an ATM with your credit/debit card logo on it. Large branches of Banco do Brasil (no withdrawal fees for credit cards) usually have one, and most all Bradesco, Citibank, BankBoston, Santander and HSBC machines will work. Banco 24 Horas is a network of ATMs which accept foreign cards (charging R$ 10 per withdrawal). Withdrawal limits are usually R$ 700 (Bradesco) or R$ 1000 (BB, HSBC, B24H), per transaction, and in any case R$ 1000 per day. The latter can be circumvented by several consecutive withdrawals, choosing different \"accounts\", i.e. \"credit card\", \"checking\", \"savings\". Note that most ATMs do not work or will only give you R$ 100 after 10 PM. In some smaller towns there is no ATM able to accept foreign cards. Be sure you carry enough cash if you intend to stay far from larger cities.\n</p><p>There are many federal regulations for dealings with foreign currency, trading in any currency other than Real in Brazil is illegal, although some places in big cities and bordering towns accept foreign money and many exchange offices operate in a shady area. In addition, exchange offices are almost impossible to find outside of big cities. Currencies other than USD and EUR are hard to exchange and the rates are ridiculous. If you would like to exchange cash at a bank, be prepared to pay a hefty commission. E.g., Banco do Brasil collects US$15 for each transaction (regardless of amount). In May 2016 (just 3 months before Rio Olympic Games) Federal Government enacted new taxes over currency exchange: 1.1% for bill (species) transactions and 6.38% for travellers' check and credit card ones.\n</p><p>Wiring money to Brazil can be done through Western Union [31] transfers to be picked up at a Banco do Brasil branch in most cities, and also quite a few exchange offices.\n</p><p>A majority of Brazilian shops now accepts major credit cards. However quite a few online stores only accept cards issued in Brazil, even though they sport the international logo of such cards. It is also very common for credit cards being used like debit card. When you pay using card commonly you will hear the question: \"Cr\u00e9dito ou d\u00e9bito?\" (\"Credit or debit?\"). Using debit card is like paying in cash, the difference is, the cash was in your bank account - not in your wallet.\n</p><p>Contactless cards are accepted in Brazil but not widely understood. Merchants are often confused by the concept of entering the transaction amount into their card terminal before presenting the card. If you see a contactless symbol on a merchant's card terminal, then it will accept contactless payments, although the chances are that the employee won't know the procedure. By the time they have worked out the procedure, it will have been faster to use chip &amp; PIN instead. Apple Pay works on contactless card terminals in Brazil, at least for MasterCard, despite not yet being supported for cards issued in Brazil.\n</p><p>Some places put signs stating a minimum card value payment. This is illegal. Every commercial establishment that accepts card is required to accept payment regardless of the amount. If the merchant that accepts cards refuses to receive the payment due to the low value, call the police or PROCON (consumer protection agency). It is also illegal to pay change for cents with candies (for example, R$ 0,05 or R$ 0,10) without asking the customer in advance. You have the right to refuse the candies and demand true money.\n</p><p>Coins are R$0.05, R$0.10, R$0.25, R$0.50 and R$1. Some denominations have several different designs. Images from the central bank of Brazil [32]. And more [33]. Bills come in the following denominations: R$2 , R$5 , R$10 (still a few plastic red and blue around), R$20 , R$ 50 and $100. Images from the central bank of Brazil [34].\n</p><p>Since 2010 Real bills were redesigned and are replacing old ones. Still, you are likely to find some older bills circulating. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Souvenirs\">Souvenirs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Souvenirs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Similar to the rest of Latin America, hand-crafted <b>jewelry</b> can be found anywhere.

If you have space in your bags, a Brazilian woven cotton <b>hammock</b> is a nice, functional purchase as well. Another interesting and fun item is a <b>peteca</b>, a sort of hand shuttlecock used in a traditional game of the same name, similar to volleyball.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Shopping\">Shopping</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=39\" title=\"Edit section: Shopping\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It's not a bad idea to pack light and acquire Brazilian clothes within a couple of days of arrival. It will make you less obvious as a tourist. Brazilians have their own sense of style and that makes tourists - especially those in Hawaiian shirts or sandals with socks - stand out in the crowd. Have some fun shopping, and blend in.\n</p><p>Store windows will often display a price followed by \"X 5\" or \"X 10\", etc. This is an installment-sale price. The price displayed is the per-installment price, so that, \"R$50 X 10\", for example, means 10 payments (typically monthly) of R$50 each.\n</p><p>Make sure any appliances you buy are either dual voltage or the same as in your home country. Frequency in Brazil is 60Hz, so don't buy electric clocks or non-battery operated motorized items if you live in Europe or countries like Argentina, Australia or New Zealand. Voltage however varies by state or even regions inside the same state. (see <a href=\"/en/Brazil#Electricity\" title=\"Brazil\">Electricity</a> below).\n</p><p>Brazilian-made appliances and electronics are usually expensive or of poor quality. All electronics are expensive compared to European or US prices.  \n</p><p>Brazil uses a hybrid video system called \"PAL-M.\"  It is NOT at all compatible with the PAL system of Europe and Australia. Television began in black and white using the NTSC system of the USA and Canada, then years later, using PAL for its analogue colour - making PAL-M a totally unique system.  Nowadays, most new TV sets are NTSC compatible. However the newly-introduced digital TV standard is not compatible with that of most other countries. Digital video appliances such as DVD players are also compatible with NTSC (all digital colour is the same worldwide), but make sure the DVD region code(s), if any, match your home country (Brazil is part of Region 4). Prices for imported electronic goods can be quite expensive due to high import tax, and the range of domestic electronic gadgets is not very wide. Also, be aware that the term \"DVD\" in Brazil is both an abbreviation for the disc itself and for its player, so be specific to avoid confusion.\n</p><p>There are plenty of bargains to be had, especially leather goods, including shoes (remember sizes are different though). Clothes in general are a good buy, especially for women, for whom there are many classy items. Street markets, which are common, are also a cheap option, but avoid brand names like \"Nike\" - you will pay more and it's fake. Don't be afraid to \"feel\" an item. If it doesn't feel right, most likely it isn't. Beware of the dreaded \"Made in China\" label, and be in mind some Brazilian-made products are less robust than their American or European counterparts.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eat\">Eat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=40\" title=\"Edit section: Eat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Eat\" title=\"click to add a eat listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '40', 'eat', 'Brazil');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Feijoada_completa.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Feijoada_completa.jpg/250px-Feijoada_completa.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"162\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Feijoada_completa.jpg/375px-Feijoada_completa.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Feijoada_completa.jpg/500px-Feijoada_completa.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"3539\" data-file-height=\"2295\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Feijoada_completa.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Feijoada</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cuisine\">Cuisine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41\" title=\"Edit section: Cuisine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Brazil's cuisine is as varied as its geography and culture. On the other hand, some may find it an unrefined melange, and everyday fare can be bland and monotonous. While there are some quite unique dishes of regional origin, many dishes were brought by overseas immigrants and have been adapted to local tastes through the generations. Italian and Chinese food in Brazil can often be as baffling as Amazonian fare.\n</p><p>Brazil's national dish is <b>feijoada</b>, a hearty stew made of black beans, pork (ears, knuckles, chops, sausage) and beef (usually dried). It's served with rice, garnished with collard greens and sliced oranges. It's not served in every restaurant; the ones that serve it typically offer it on Wednesdays and Saturdays. A typical mistake made by tourists is to eat too much <i>feijoada</i> upon first encounter.

Waiters carry huge cuts of meat on steel spits from table to table, and carve off slices onto your plate (use the tongs to grab the meat slice and don't touch the knife edge with your silverware to avoid dulling the edge). Traditionally, you are given a small wooden block colored green on one side and red on the other. When you're ready to eat, put the green side up. When you're too stuffed to even tell the waiter you've had enough, put the red side up... <i>Rodizio</i> places have a buffet for non-meaty items; beware that in some places, the desserts are not considered part of the main buffet and are charged as a supplement. Most churrasco restaurants (<i>churrascarias</i>) also serve other types of food, so it is safe to go there with a friend that is not really fond of meat. While churrascarias are usually fairly expensive places (for Brazilian standards) in the North, Central and the countryside areas of the country they tend to be much cheaper then in the South and big cities, where they are frequented even by the less affluent. Black beans stew (<i>feijao</i> ou <i>feijoada</i>) is also very popular, particularly in Rio de Janeiro, where most restaurants traditionally serve the dish on Saturdays. It comprises black beans cooked with pork meat accompanied by rice and farofa (manioca flour with eggs) and greens fried with garlic.</li>\n<li> <b>Mineiro</b> is the \"miner's\" cuisine of <a href=\"/en/Minas_Gerais\" title=\"Minas Gerais\">Minas Gerais</a>, based on pork and beans, with some vegetables. Dishes from Goi\u00e1s are similar, but use some local ingredients such as <i>pequi</i> and <i>guariroba</i>. Minas Gerais cuisine if not seen as particularly tasty, has a \"homely\" feel that is much cherished.</li>\n<li> The food of <b>Bahia</b>, on the northeast coast has its roots across the Atlantic in East Africa and Indian cuisine. Coconut, dende palm oil, hot peppers, and seafood are the prime ingredients. Tip: hot (\"quente\") means lots of pepper, cold (\"frio\") means less or no pepper at all. If you dare to eat it <i>hot</i> you should try <i>acaraj\u00e9</i> (deep fried edible black bean soup) and vatap\u00e1 (prawn-filled roasties).</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Esp%C3%ADrito_Santo\" title=\"Esp\u00edrito Santo\">Esp\u00edrito Santo</a> and <a href=\"/en/Bahia\" title=\"Bahia\">Bahia</a> have two different versions of <i>moqueca</i>, a delightful tomato-based seafood stew prepared in a special type of clay pot.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/North_(Brazil)\" title=\"North (Brazil)\">Amazonian</a> cuisine draws from the food of the indigenous inhabitants, including various exotic fish and vegetables. There is also a stupendous variety of tropical fruits.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Cear%C3%A1\" title=\"Cear\u00e1\">Cear\u00e1</a>'s food has a great sort of seafood, and is known to have the country's best crab. It's so popular that literally every weekend thousands of people go to <b>Praia do Futuro</b> in Fortaleza to eat fried fish and crabs (usually followed by cold beer).</li>\n<li> In the coastal cities of <a href=\"/en/Paran%C3%A1\" title=\"Paran\u00e1\">Paran\u00e1</a> like <a href=\"/en/Morretes\" title=\"Morretes\">Morretes</a> and <a href=\"/en/Antonina\" title=\"Antonina\">Antonina</a>, the dish named <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Barreado&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Barreado (page does not exist)\">barreado</a> is served. It's a meat stew thickened with manioc flour and served with slices of banana, slowly cooked for at least 12 hours on hermetically-sealed clay pots.</li></ul>\n<p>Brazilian cuisine also has a lot of imports:\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>Pizza</b> is very popular in Brazil. In S\u0101o Paulo, travellers will find the highest rate of pizza parlours per inhabitant in the country. The variety of flavours is extremely vast, with some restaurants offering more than 100 types of pizza. It is worth noting the difference between the European \"mozzarella\" and the Brazilian \"mussarela\". They differ in flavor, appearance and origin but buffalo mozzarella (\"mussarela de b\u00fafala\") is also often available. The Brazilian \"mussarela\", which tops most pizzas, is yellow in color and has a stronger taste. In some restaurants, particularly in the South, pizza has no tomato sauce. Other dishes of Italian origin, such as <b>macarr\u00e3o</b> (macaroni), <b>lasanha</b> and others are also very popular.</li>\n<li> Middle-eastern (actually Levantine; i.e., mostly <a href=\"/en/Syria\" title=\"Syria\">Syrian</a> and <a href=\"/en/Lebanon\" title=\"Lebanon\">Lebanese</a>) food is widely available. Most options offer high quality and a big variety. Some types of middle-eastern food, such as <i>quibe</i> and <i>esfiha</i> have been adapted and are available at snack stands and fast food joints nation-wide. You can also find shawarma (kebabs) stands, which Brazilians call \"churrasco grego\" (Greek Barbecue)</li>\n<li> S\u00e3o Paulo's <b>Japanese</b> restaurants serve up lots of tempura, yakisoba, sushi and sashimi. The variety is good and mostly the prices are very attractive when compared to Europe, USA and Japan. Most Japanese restaurants also offer the <i>rodizio</i> or <i>buffet</i> option, with the same quality as if you ordered from the menu. Sometimes, however, it can be quite a departure from the real thing. The same can be said of <a href=\"/en/China\" title=\"China\">Chinese</a> food, again with some variations from the traditional. Cheese-filled spring rolls, anyone.Japanese restaurants (or those that offer Japanese food) are much commoner than Chinese and can be found in many Brazilian cities, especially in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Restaurants\">Restaurants</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=43\" title=\"Edit section: Restaurants\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li> <b>All</b> restaurants will add a 10% service charge on the bill, and this is all the tip a Brazilian will ever pay. It is also what most waiters survive on, but it is not mandatory and you may choose to ignore it, although is considered extremely rude to do it. In some tourist areas you might be tried for extra tip, but you don't need to tip more - Brazilian tourist almost never do it.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> There are two types of self-service restaurants,sometimes with both options available in one place: all-you-can-eat buffets with barbecue served at the tables, called <b>rod\u00edzio</b>, or a price per weight (<b>por quilo</b>), very common during lunchtime throughout Brazil. Load up at the buffet and get your plate on the scales before eating any. In the South there's also the traditional Italian \"galeto\", where you're served different types of pasta, salads, soups and meat (mostly chicken) at your table.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Customers are allowed by law to visit the kitchen and see how the food is being handled, although it's uncommon. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Some Brazilian restaurants serve only meals for two. The size of the portions might not say in the menu, so it's recommended asking the waiter. Most restaurants of this category allow for a \"half-serving\" of such plates (<i>meia-por\u00e7\u00e3o</i>), at 60-70% of the price. Also, couples at restaurants often sit side-by-side rather than across from each other; observe your waiter's cues or express your preference when being seated. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> Fast food is also very popular, and the local takes on hamburgers and hot-dogs (\"cachorro-quente\", translated literally) are well worth trying. Brazilian sandwiches come in many varieties, with ingredients like mayonnaise, bacon, ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, corn, peas, raisins, french fries, ketchup, eggs, pickles, etc. Brave eaters may want to try the traditional complete hot dog (just ask for a <i>completo</i>), which, aside from the bun and the sausage, will include everything on display. The ubiquitous <i>X-Burger</i> (and its varieties X-Salad, X-Tudo, etc.) is not as mysterious as it sounds: the pronunciation of the letter \"X\" in Portuguese sounds like \"cheese\", hence the name.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Large chains: The fast-food burger chain <i>Bob's</i> is found nationwide and has been around in the country for almost as long as McDonald's. There is also a national fast-food chain called <i>Habib's</i> which despite the name serves pizza in addition to Arabian food (and the founder is a Portuguese migrant, by the way). Recent additions, though not as widespread, are Burger King and Subway.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drink\">Drink</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=44\" title=\"Edit section: Drink\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Drink\" title=\"click to add a drink listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '44', 'drink', 'Brazil');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Cachaca.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cachaca.JPG/200px-Cachaca.JPG\" width=\"200\" height=\"248\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cachaca.JPG/300px-Cachaca.JPG 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/94/Cachaca.JPG/400px-Cachaca.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"1870\" data-file-height=\"2315\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Cachaca.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Cacha\u00e7a</div></div></div>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:202px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Caipirinha_and_cacha%C3%A7a_bottles_-_Brazil_jpg.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Caipirinha_and_cacha%C3%A7a_bottles_-_Brazil_jpg.jpg/200px-Caipirinha_and_cacha%C3%A7a_bottles_-_Brazil_jpg.jpg\" width=\"200\" height=\"164\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Caipirinha_and_cacha%C3%A7a_bottles_-_Brazil_jpg.jpg/300px-Caipirinha_and_cacha%C3%A7a_bottles_-_Brazil_jpg.jpg 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/Caipirinha_and_cacha%C3%A7a_bottles_-_Brazil_jpg.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"386\" data-file-height=\"317\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Caipirinha_and_cacha%C3%A7a_bottles_-_Brazil_jpg.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Caipirinha and cacha\u00e7a bottles</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Alcohol\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=45\" title=\"Edit section: Alcohol\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Brazil's national booze is <b>cacha\u00e7a</b> (<i>cah-shah-sah</i>, also known as <i>aguardente</i> (\"burning water\") and <i>pinga</i>), a sugar-cane liquor known to knock the unwary out quite quickly. Mass-produced, industrial cacha\u00e7a is cheap and has 40% alcohol. Rural, tradicional cacha\u00e7a made on small distilleries usually has about 20% alcohol, but is highly praised nationwide for its superior taste. This also means it's far more costly, but it's worth each Real. It can be tried in virtually every bar in the country. Famous producing regions include <a href=\"/en/Minas_Gerais\" title=\"Minas Gerais\">Minas Gerais</a>, where there are tours of distilleries, and the city of <a href=\"/en/Paraty\" title=\"Paraty\">Paraty</a>. <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Pirassununga&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Pirassununga (page does not exist)\">Pirassununga</a> is home to Caninha 51, Brazil's best-selling brand. Outside <a href=\"/en/Fortaleza\" title=\"Fortaleza\">Fortaleza</a> there is a cacha\u00e7a museum (<i>Museu da Cacha\u00e7a</i>) where you can learn about the history of the Ypioca brand. \n</p><p>Drinking cacha\u00e7a straight, or stirring in only a dollop of honey or a bit of lime juice, is a common habit on the Northeast region of the country, but the strength of cacha\u00e7a can be hidden in cocktails like the famous <b>caipirinha</b>, where it is mixed with sugar, lime juice and ice. Using vodka instead of cacha\u00e7a is nicknamed <b>caipiroska</b> or <b>caipivodka</b>; with white rum, it's a <b>caipir\u00edssima</b>; and with sake it's a <b>caipisaque</b> (not in every region). Another interesting concoction is called <b>capeta</b> (\"devil\"), made with cacha\u00e7a, condensed milk, cinnamon, guarana powder (a mild stimulant), and other ingredients, varying by region. If you enjoy fine brandy or grappa, try an <b>aged cacha\u00e7a</b>. Deep and complex, this golden-coloured spirit is nothing like the ubiquitous clear liquor more commonly seen. A fun trip is to an \"alambique\" - a local distillery, of which there are thousands throughout the country - not only will you be able to see how the spirit is made from the raw cane sugar, you will probably also get a better price.\n</p><p>Well worth a try is Brazilian whisky! It's actually 50% imported scotch - the malt component -and  approximately 50% Brazilian grain spirit. Don't be misled by American sounding names like \"Wall Street\". It is not bourbon. \n</p><p>While <b>imported alcohol</b> is very expensive, many international brands are produced under license in Brazil, making them widely available, and fairly cheap. You can buy booze in the tax-free after landing at Brazilian airports, but it generally is more expensive than buying it outside the airports.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Beer\">Beer</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=46\" title=\"Edit section: Beer\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Beer</b> in Brazil has a respectable history because of the German immigrants. Most Brazilian beer brands tend to be way less thick and bitter than German, Danish or English beer. More than 90% of all beer consumed in Brazil is Light Lager type, like Standard American Lager, here called Pilsner, and it is usually drunk very cold (direct from refrigerator). The most popular domestic brands are <b>Brahma</b>, <b>Antarctica</b>, and <b>Skol</b>. Traditional brands include <b>Bohemia</b>, <b>Caracu - a stout -</b>, <b>Original</b> and <b>Serramalte</b>. They are easily found in bars and are worth trying but are usually a little bit more expensive than the popular beers. There are also some national premium and craft beers that are found only in some specific bars and supermarkets; if you want to taste a good Brazilian beer, search for <b>Baden Baden</b>, <b>Colorado</b>, <b>Eisenbahn</b>, <b>Petra</b>, <b>Theresopolis</b>, <b>Coruja</b> and others. There are also some international beers produced by national breweries like Heineken and Stella Artois and have a slightly different taste if compared with the original beers.  \n</p><p>There are two ways of drinking beer in bars: draft or bottled beer. Draft lager beer is called <b>chope</b> or <b>chopp</b> ('SHOH-pee'), and is commonly served with one inch of foam, but you can make a complaint to the bartender if the foam is consistently thicker than that. In bars, the waiter will usually collect the empty glasses and bottles on a table and replace them with full ones, until you ask him to stop, in a \"tap\" charging system. In the case of bottled beer, bottles (350ml, 600ml or 1l) are shared among everyone at the table and poured in small glasses, rather than drunk straight from the bottle. Brazilians like their beer nearly ice-cold - hence, to keep the temperature down, bottles of beer are often kept in an insulated polystyrene container on the table.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Wine\">Wine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47\" title=\"Edit section: Wine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><a href=\"/en/Rio_Grande_do_Sul\" title=\"Rio Grande do Sul\">Rio Grande do Sul</a> is the leading <b>wine</b> production region.

New Year, Carnival (movable between February and March, see <i>Understand</i> above) and Holy week are the peak periods, and prices can skyrocket, especially in coastal cities like Rio and Salvador. Also, during those holidays, many hotels restrict bookings to a 3 or 4-day minimum and charge in advance.\n</p><p><b>Hotels</b> are plentiful in just about all areas of Brazil and can range from luxury beach resorts to very modest and inexpensive choices. The Brazilian tourism regulation board imposes specific minimum attributes for each type of facility, but as the 1-5 star rating is no longer enforced, check in advance if your hotel provides the kind of services you expect.\n</p><p><b>Pousada</b> means guesthouse (the local equivalent of a French <i>auberge</i> or a British <i>boarding house</i>), and are usually simpler than hotels, and will offer fewer services (room service, laundry etc.). Pousadas are even more widespread than hotels.\n</p><p>In wilderness areas like the <a href=\"/en/Pantanal\" title=\"Pantanal\">Pantanal</a>, travelers usually stay in <b>fazendas</b>, which are ranches with guest facilities. In small towns of Minas Gerais people are fond of <b>hot\u00e9is-fazenda</b> (farm hotels) where you can swim, ride, walk, play football, and camp as well as sleep in picturesque barracks.\n</p><p>Also there is great fun in going on a <b>boat hotel</b> which will take you to inaccessible places on the rivers and lakes for great fishing trips or for simply relaxing and watching and photographing the wildlife which is very abundant in the Pantanal. The boats are large, safe, and comfortable with air-conditioned rooms (very necessary). Several small aluminum boats with outboard motor, carried by the boat hotel, driven by experienced fisher/guide will take 2 or 3 tourists to the best \"points\".\n</p><p><b>Motel</b> is the local term for a \"sex hotel\". There's no social stigma per se in staying in one, but the room service and rates are geared to adults staying for a few hours with utmost discretion and privacy. \n</p><p><b>Youth <a href=\"/en/Hostels\" title=\"Hostels\">hostels</a></b> (<i>albergues da juventude</i>) are becoming increasingly common.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Learn\">Learn</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=52\" title=\"Edit section: Learn\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Portuguese courses for foreigners are not widespread outside the big cities.

In theory, you must have a work permit (<i>Autoriza\u00e7\u00e3o de Trabalho</i>) from the Ministry of Labor before you can get a job. However, in order to obtain it, you must be sponsored by an employer before entering the country. The company must want a foreigner bad enough to pay the government upwards of R$2000 to sponsor you, knowing also that they are required by law to simultaneously hire and train a replacement for you. Because of this, finding a legal job can be a pretty daunting bureaucratic task. \n</p><p>If you are a native English speaker, you may be able to find an English-teaching part-time job, but don't expect that to save your holidays. Although working in the informal market can seem hassle-free at first, there are risks as well. The pay will be under-the-table without contract, so it will be difficult for you to claim your labor rights later. In the bigger cities, there is also the danger of being turned in to the authorities by a rival school, which may see you to a plane home earlier than you had planned. \n</p><p>There is also a growing demand for Spanish language classes, so native Spanish speakers should have no trouble finding work, especially in the major cities. In both cases, it's always much more lucrative to find work privately rather than through schools. This can be done easily, for example by putting an ad in the classifieds section of the Veja weekly news magazine (you have to pay for it) or by putting up signs on the notice boards at universities like USP (free of charge). \n</p><p>Refer to the Ministry of Labour website <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.mte.gov.br/trab_estrang_ing/default.asp\">[32]</a> for more detailed information.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_safe\">Stay safe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=54\" title=\"Edit section: Stay safe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>By law, everyone must carry a photo ID at all times.

The murder rate is four times higher than many developed nations and rates for other crimes are similarly high. Crimes such as pickpocketing, car jackings, burglaries and armed robberies are a common sight in the country. It's important to stay vigilant and be aware of your surroundings. \n</p><p>Do not act like a tourist, do not accept little gifts like necklances from strangers, they might be used to mark tourists as easy prey, and do not display items of wealth such as laptops, jewellery, etc. Avoid carrying large amounts of money with you, and if you do, it is wise to keep it in multiple pockets.\n</p><p>Always ask locals about the places that you are intending to go, since many of them are extremely dangerous and can put you in a very bad situation. However, if you're not a Portuguese speaker, you will face serious difficulties.\n</p><p>For safety reasons, <b>do not</b> even enter favelas - They can be extremely dangerous, given the fact that gangs use them for their criminal operations.\n</p><p>The efficiency of the police force varies depending on the region of the country, as their wages vary from state to state. Most problems of inefficiency occur in the northern part of the country. <b>Do not attempt to bribe them</b>.  \n</p><p>The local equivalent to the \u201c911\u201d emergency line in Brazil is divided between three services: 190 - Policia (Police), 192- Ambulancia (Ambulance), and 193- Bombeiros (Fire Department).

The later in the day, the worse it gets. Bottled and canned drinks are safe, although some people will insist on using a straw to avoid contact with the exterior of the container.\n</p><p>Bear in mind the heat and humidity when storing perishable foods.\n</p><p>Tap water varies from place to place, (from contaminated, saline or soaked with chlorine to plain drinkable) and Brazilians themselves usually prefer to have it filtered.\n</p><p>In airports, bus stations, as well as many of the cheaper hotels, it is common to find drinking fountains (<i>bebedouro</i>), although not always safe. In hostel kitchens, look for the tap with the cylindrical filter attached. In more expensive hotels, there is often no publicly accessible fountain, and bedrooms contain minibars \u2014 selling you mineral water at extremely inflated prices.\n</p><p>Vaccination against yellow fever and taking anti-malaria medication may be necessary if you are traveling to central-western (Mato Grosso) or northern (Amazon) regions. If you're arriving from Peru, Colombia or Bolivia, proof of yellow fever vaccination is required before you enter Brazil. Some countries, such as <a href=\"/en/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a> and <a href=\"/en/South_Africa\" title=\"South Africa\">South Africa</a>, will require evidence of yellow fever vaccination before allowing you enter the country if you have been in any part of Brazil within the previous week. Check the requirements of any country you will travel to from Brazil.\n</p><p>Public hospitals tend to be crowded and terrible. Most cities of at least 60,000 inhabitants have good private health care.\n</p><p>Dentists abound and are way cheaper than North America and Western Europe. In general, the quality of their work is consistent, but ask a local for advice and a recommendation. \n</p><p>The emergency number is <b>192</b>, but you must speak Portuguese; English-speaking operators are non-existent.\n</p><p>Beware that air conditioning in airports, intercity buses etc. is often quite strong. Carry a long-sleeved garment for air-conditioned places.\n</p><p>Brazil has one of the best HIV prevention programs and consequently, a very low infection rate compared with most countries.

But don't imitate them, as they are likely to feel offended if you criticize their country or customs. In some small towns, local politics can be a sensitive issue and you should be careful when talking about it. Be polite, as always.\n</p><p>Be aware that <b>racism is a very serious offense in Brazil</b>. Anyone may be <b>arrested</b> by exposing racist ideas. Most Brazilians frown upon racism, and even if you are only joking or you think you know your company, it is still wise to refrain from anything that can be perceived as racism. According to the Brazilian constitution of 1988, racism is a crime for which bail is not available, and must be met with 6 months to 8 years imprisonment. This is taken very seriously. However, the law only seems to apply to overt, unquestionably racist statements and actions. Therefore, be aware and be respectful when discussing racial relations in Brazil; do not assume you understand Brazil's history of racial inequality and slavery better than a Brazilian person of color.\n</p><p>Remember that Portuguese is not Spanish and Brazilians (as well as other Portuguese speakers) feel offended if you do not take this in mind. Both languages can be mutually intelligible to a certain extent, but they differ considerably in phonetics, vocabulary and grammar. It is not a good idea to mix Portuguese with Spanish, don't expect people to understand what you're saying if you (intentionally or unintentionally) insert Spanish words into Portuguese sentences.\n</p><p>It is also noteworthy that some Brazilians are fanatical about football (soccer) and so there are (some times violent) disputes between teams from different cities (and rivalry between teams of the same city), and walking with the shirt of a team in certain areas may be seen as controversial or even dangerous. Speaking ill of the Brazilian national football team is not considered an insult, but you should never praise the Argentine team or compare them both.\n</p><p>Brazil is open to LGBT tourists. S\u00e3o Paulo boasts the biggest LGBT Pride parade in the world, and most major cities will have gay scenes. However, be aware that homophobia is widespread in Brazilian society, and Brazil is not the sexual haven that many foreigners perceive it to be. Couples that in any way don't conform to traditional heterosexual expectations should expect to be open to some verbal harassment and stares if displaying affection in the streets, though several neighborhoods of many of the major cities are very welcoming of the LGBT population, and LGBT-oriented bars and clubs are common. Generally, display moderate affection and avoid kissing in public, specially on bus and subway. It is best to gather information from locals as to what areas are more conservative and what areas are more progressive.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Social_etiquette\">Social etiquette</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=58\" title=\"Edit section: Social etiquette\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<ul><li> Cheek-kissing is very common in Brazil, among women and between women and men. When two women, or opposite sexes first meet, it is not uncommon to kiss. Two men WILL shake hands. A man kissing another man's cheek is extremely bizarre for Brazilian standards (unless in father-son relationships). Kissing is suitable for informal occasions, used to introduce yourself or being acquainted, especially to young people. Hand shaking is more appropriate for formal occasions or between women and men when no form of intimacy is intended. Trying to shake hands when offered a kiss will be considered odd, but never rude. However, to clearly refuse a kiss is a sign of disdain.</li></ul>\n<p>When people first meet, they will kiss once (S\u00e3o Paulo and Brasilia), twice (Rio de Janeiro) or three times (Florian\u00f3polis and Belo Horizonte, for instance), depending on where you are, alternating right and left cheeks. Observe that while doing this, you should not kiss on the cheeks (like in Russia) but actually only touch cheeks and make a kissing sound while kissing the air.\n</p>\n<ul><li> In Brazil showers are long and frequent. In fact Brazil is the only country that rivals Japan in the amount of time people spend cleaning themselves</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Many Brazilians can dance and Brazilians are usually at ease with their own bodies. While talking, they may stand closer to each other than North Americans or Northern Europeans do, and also tend to touch each other more, e.g. on the shoulder or arm, hugs etc.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> Brazilians like to drink, especially (very) cold beer (in pubs and in hot weather) and wine (in restaurants or in the winter). However getting drunk, even in a pub, is considered very unsuitable unless you are with very good friends and everybody is as drunk as you. People go to pubs to talk, flirt and tell jokes, not essentially to drink.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact\">Contact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=59\" title=\"Edit section: Contact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_phone\">By phone</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brazil&amp;action=edit&amp;section=60\" title=\"Edit section: By phone\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Brazil has international telephone code 55 and two-digit area codes, and phone numbers are eight digits long (9 digits since 2012).

You might think that the priority one will make it go faster, but it isn't true; it takes as long as the normal fare, so be sure to ask for the \"econ\u00f4mico\" price of anything you wish to dispatch.\nDespite loss of parcels are very rare, brazilian post and customs are very slow mainly with international packages  a international parcel sent from brazil delay more than 20 days to be dispatched from the country, as a international parcel to Brazil delay in customs for about 60 days, \n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><br />\n</p><p><a href=\"//wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Category%3ASouth_America&amp;action=edit&amp;preload=Template:IsPartOf/preload\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"><img alt=\"Create category\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/15px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/23px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/30px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"300\" data-file-height=\"300\" /></a>\n</p>\n<!-- \nNewPP limit report\nCached time: 20190328191015\nCache expiry: 86400\nDynamic content: false\nCPU time usage: 0.182 seconds\nReal time usage: 0.302 seconds\nPreprocessor visited node count: 819/1000000\nPreprocessor generated node count: 4159/1000000\nPost\u2010expand include size: 23513/3145728 bytes\nTemplate argument size: 11700/3145728 bytes\nHighest expansion depth: 6/40\nExpensive parser function count: 1/100\n-->\n<!--\nTransclusion expansion time report (%,ms,calls,template)\n100.00%   43.067      1 -total\n 26.66%   11.481      1 Template:Quickbar\n 21.60%    9.302      1 Template:Regionlist\n 12.61%    5.430      1 Template:Pagebanner\n  9.52%    4.100      1 Template:IsPartOf\n  9.05%    3.896      5 Template:Regionlistitem\n  7.78%    3.349     11 Template:Quickbar_item\n  4.15%    1.786      1 Template:HasDocent\n  4.09%    1.763      1 Template:Cautionbox\n  4.02%    1.730      4 Template:Infobox\n-->\n</div>\n<!-- Saved in parser cache with key wikitravel_org_en:pcache:idhash:256-0!canonical and timestamp 20190328191015 and revision id 2590964\n -->\n"

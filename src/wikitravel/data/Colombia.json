Lying to the south of  <a href=\"/en/Panama\" title=\"Panama\">Panama</a>, Colombia controls the land access between <a href=\"/en/Central_America\" title=\"Central America\">Central</a> and South America.  With Panama to the north, Colombia is surrounded by <a href=\"/en/Venezuela\" title=\"Venezuela\">Venezuela</a> to the east, <a href=\"/en/Brazil\" title=\"Brazil\">Brazil</a> to the southeast, and <a href=\"/en/Ecuador\" title=\"Ecuador\">Ecuador</a> and <a href=\"/en/Peru\" title=\"Peru\">Peru</a> to the south west. The country was named in honor of Christopher Columbus, following the Italian version of his name (Cristoforo Colombo). Although Columbus never actually set foot on the current Colombian territory, in his fourth voyage he visited Panama, which <i>was</i> part of Colombia until 1903.\n</p><p>Each day tourism grows, traveling in Colombia is definitely worthwhile.  Colombia has diferents kinds of ecosystems, so you can choose the places to visit depending on which \"season\" you want to stay. From <b>Bogot\u00e1</b> at 2640 m.a.s.l, with an average temperature of 14 degrees Celsius with a temperate climate, to <b>Sierra nevada del cocuy</b> an ice cap at 5380  m.a.s.l. Just a drive of one or two hours North, South, East or West can take you to landscapes which are as diverse as they are beautiful. To historic city centres and towns, modern and energetic party cities, oriental plains which stretch out far beyond the horizon with little modulation. rugged contours of the higher Andean region, the Guajira peninsula and its desert, idylic beaches, the tropical jungle of the Amazon and the Choco with abundant flora and fauna, snowy peaks and volcanoes, ancient ruins, the Magdalena River valley and its hot weather, beautiful coral reefs and an abundant underwater marine life together with pleasant relaxed tropical islands, and the ability to rest and relax in a privately rented <i>hacienda</i> that lets you have and enjoy these treasures to yourself. Such a diversity comes in with an equal diverse amount of traditions and foods. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Climate\">Climate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Climate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Take your pick, really. Colombia is an equatorial country with amazing variance in altitude, so it's going to be pretty whatever temperature you like best all year long somewhere! The climate is tropical along the coast, eastern plains, and Amazon; cold in the highlands with periodic droughts. Lacking the usual seasons, Colombians normally refer to rainy seasons as winter\u2014but the differences in terrain and altitude mean the rainy seasons are different in every corner of the country! \n</p><p>The one downside to all this climactic diversity, though, is that you'll have to bring a fair amount of different clothes if you plan to travel extensively.

The area that now is Colombia was conquered by the Spanish through alliances with some indigenous groups when America was invaded by Europeans. The process of conquest and colonization radically altered the social structures of the areas, the indigenous populations shrank dramatically in size and their share of the population has declined ever since. The Spanish Empire brought European settlers, while most of the population in the colony was of mixed Spanish and Indigenous ancestry. In the 16th century, Europeans began to bring slaves from Africa. The Spanish empire didn't engage in the slave trade directly, the Spanish empire relied on the asiento system, awarding merchants (mostly from other countries) the license to trade enslaved people to their colonies and the majority of these traders were Portuguese, French, English and Dutch.\n</p><p>Colombian independence from Spain was won in 1819, but by 1830 the \"Gran Colombia\" Federation was dissolved. It was one of the five countries liberated by Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar (the others being Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru and Bolivia). The success of the Independence movements across Latin America was made easier by the Napoleonic Wars that left mainland Spain with two rivaling governments. What is now Colombia and Panama emerged as the Republic of New Granada. The new nation experimented with federalism as the Granadine Confederation (1858), and then the United States of Colombia (1863), before the Republic of Colombia was finally declared in 1886. The United States of America's intentions to control the Panama Canal led to Panama becoming a separate nation in 1903.\n</p><p>Colombia was the first constitutional government in South America. Slavery was abolished in the country in 1851. The years following independence were marked by several civil wars, the legacy of these conflicts combined with state repression against leftist militias in rural areas and world polarization caused by the Cold War culminated in a communist insurgent campaign in 1964 by the FARC and the ELN to overthrow the Colombian Government. The years during the conflict were marked by heavy fighting between the communist guerrillas, the Colombian state and military, right-wing paramilitaries and several drug cartels. In the years following 2005 the safety has been improving throughout the country. As part of a difficult peace process the AUC (right-wing paramilitaries) as a formal organization had ceased to function, and in 2012 the government and the FARC started peace talks aiming at bringing the 50 year old Civil War to an end once and for all. Colombia is currently in a process of recovery with an rapidly improving economy. Ending the conflict, wealth inequality and rebuilding the nation are some of the issues that confront the country. In October 2016, President Santos was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in bringing the country's five decades of civil war to an end. Now Colombia is becoming a <b>tourist hotspot</b>, each month arrives several amounts of tourist, and is becoming safer, actually is safer than some places in United states.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div id=\"region_list\">\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:352px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Colombia_regions_map.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"Colombia regions map.png\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/dd/Colombia_regions_map.png/350px-Colombia_regions_map.png\" width=\"350\" height=\"435\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/dd/Colombia_regions_map.png/525px-Colombia_regions_map.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/dd/Colombia_regions_map.png/700px-Colombia_regions_map.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"2013\" data-file-height=\"2500\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Colombia_regions_map.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div></div></div></div>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#989fc9\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Andino\" title=\"Andino\">Andino</a></b> <br />Rugged Andean landscapes and altiplanos containing the two largest cities in Colombia; Bogot\u00e1 and Medell\u00edn as well as nice and beautiful national parks and coffee plantations.\n</td></tr></table>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#90cca2\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Costa_Norte_(Colombia)\" title=\"Costa Norte (Colombia)\">Costa Norte</a></b> <br />The lively Colombian Caribbean keeps its share of attractions in Colombia with the historic, yet modern cities of its coast with lots of diving, trekking and exploring opportunities in the jungle and the desert.\n</td></tr></table>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#c2c690\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Orinoqu%C3%ADa\" title=\"Orinoqu\u00eda\">Orinoqu\u00eda</a></b> <br />The eastern endless plains with unique tropical savannas, gallery forests and wetlands, mostly ignored by tourists.\n</td></tr></table>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#d6c3aa\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Pacifica_(Colombia)\" title=\"Pacifica (Colombia)\">Pacifica</a></b> <br />The place where Colombia meets the Pacific brings tropical forests of the Choc\u00f3, the uniqueness of the Pacific Marine life, Colombia's best party city and Colombia's religious culture into this potential tourist hotspot.\n</td></tr></table>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#7aa87e\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Amazonia_(Colombia)\" title=\"Amazonia (Colombia)\">Amazonia</a></b> <br />The beautiful, vast and remote Amazon jungle.

Colombia is known for its exciting night life.\n</p><p>There are many groups and agencies offering eco-tourism and it is very usual to find trekking  plans (locally named 'caminatas' or 'excursiones')  on weekend; many groups (named 'caminantes') offers cheaper one day excursion, special trips (on long weekends or during periods of vacation time (January, Holy Week, July, August, October, December)  to different places in the country. Some recommended groups based out of <a href=\"/en/Bogot%C3%A1\" title=\"Bogot\u00e1\">Bogot\u00e1</a> are: Viajar y Vivir, Fundaci\u00f3n Sal Si Puedes, Caminantes del Retorno; there are many other.  Patianchos in Medell\u00edn; Rastros in Bucaramanga. If you are into adventure there's an archaeological site of an ancient city in Colombia's Sierra Nevada called Teyuna, it's a lost city created by the Arhuaco, the Kouguis and the Wiwas. It was found in 1972, when a group of local treasure looters found a series of stone steps rising up the mountainside and followed them to an abandoned city.  They usually offer guidance and transportation to the place; on long trips, include lodging and other services. The recommendation is asking if the guide has the official certification.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Buy\">Buy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=33\" title=\"Edit section: Buy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Buy\" title=\"click to add a buy listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '33', 'buy', 'Colombia');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The Colombian textile industry is well-recognized and reputable around South America and Europe. Clothing, including lingerie is particularly well-regarded as high quality and very affordable. Leather garments, shoes and accessories are also of interest to foreigners.  The best place to buy either is <a href=\"/en/Medellin\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Medellin\">Medellin</a>, known for being the fashion capital of the country, where one can buy very high quality goods at a very low cost.\n</p><p>Colombian emeralds and gold (18k) jewelry can also be very attractive for visitors. A typical Colombian style of jewelry is a copy of precolombian jewelry, which is fabricated with gold, silver and semi-precious stones.\n</p><p>The \"mochila\", the Spanish word for \"backpack\" or \"rucksack\", is also a traditional, indigenous, hand-woven Colombian bag, normally worn over the shoulder. They are commonly sold in shopping malls, especially in the Santa Marta/El Rodadero area. Mochilas usually come in three sizes - a large one to carry bigger things, a medium one to carry personal belongings, and a small one to carry coca leaves. Coca leaves are carried by local tribe members to reduce hunger, increase energy and to combat altitude sickness.\n</p><p>Handicrafts such as intricately designed jewelery are commonly sold in markets and on street corners. Many street vendors will approach people, selling t-shirts, shorts, glasses, bracelets, watches, necklaces, souvenirs, and novelty photographs. If you want to buy something, this is a good time to exercise your bartering skills. Usually you can go down by 2,000 to 3,000 pesos, however 10%-15% is the generally accepted rule. For example, if someone is selling a shirt for P$10,000, try asking if you can pay P$8,000. Go from there.\n</p><p>If you don't want to buy anything, a simple <i>gracias,</i> (\"thank you\") and a non-committal wave of your hand will deter would-be sellers.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Money\">Money</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34\" title=\"Edit section: Money\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The currency of Colombia is the <i>Colombian peso</i>, often symbolised locally as \"$\", but in our guides the ISO international symbolisation of <b>COP</b> is used.

Pastry is prevalent, both salty and sweet, including Pandebono, Pan de Yuca, Pastel Gloria, and Roscon. These vary in quality\u2014ask the locals for the best niche places to indulge.\n</p><p>For lunch, especially on Sundays, you should try a sancocho de gallina (rich chicken soup, served with part of the chicken itself, rice and vegetables/salad). Sancocho is widespread throughout the country, with countless regional variants. On the coast it features fish, and is highly recommended. Another soup, served in <a href=\"/en/Bogot%C3%A1\" title=\"Bogot\u00e1\">Bogot\u00e1</a> and the periphery, is Ajiaco (chicken soup made with three different kinds of potato, vegetables and herbs(guasca), served with rice, avocado, corn, milk cream and capers).\n</p><p>\"Bandeja paisa\" is common in most places, (the \"paisas\" are the natives from some departments in the northwest, such as <a href=\"/en/Antioquia\" title=\"Antioquia\">Antioquia</a>, <a href=\"/en/Caldas\" title=\"Caldas\">Caldas</a>, <a href=\"/en/Risaralda\" title=\"Risaralda\">Risaralda</a> and <a href=\"/en/Quind%C3%ADo\" title=\"Quind\u00edo\">Quind\u00edo</a>).

They are lighter and smaller.\n</p><p>There are a few chains throughout the country. In addition to worldwide franchises (McDonald's, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Subway, T.G.I.F., which are specially focused on Bogot\u00e1 and other big cities), Colombian chains are very strong and located in almost every city. Presto and especially El Corral serve outstanding burgers, Kokoriko makes broiled chicken and Frisby specializes in roasted chicken. Gokela is the first choice among people wanting healthy options such as wraps, salads, super foods, supplements and subsequently one of the only options for vegetarians, vegans and organic eaters.  Cr\u00eapes and Waffles, as the name indicates, is an upscale breakfast/brunch restaurant with spectacular, well, cr\u00eapes and waffles. There are many international restaurants, including rodizios (Brazilian steak house style), paella houses, etc.\n</p><p>A great variety of tropical fruits can be tasted, and the corresponding variety in juices, from some of the oddest ones you can find around the globe (really) to the sweetest ones. You just must know how to find and prepare them. Anyway, anyone would be pleased to teach you. Some examples of those exotic fruits include: tamarinds, mangoes, guanabanas, lulo, mangostines, borojo, araza, copoacu, and a great variety in citrus.  In addition, you can find some of those rich and strange flavors in prepared food like ice cream brands or restaurant juices. Most of Colombians drink juices at home and in restaurants, they are inexpensive and natural everywhere.\n</p><p>In Colombia there are a great variety of \"tamales\" if you like them, but be aware they are very different from their most famous Mexican cousins. They differ from region to region, but all of them are delicious.  They are called \"envuelto\", the sweet tamale made of corn.\n</p><p>Regarding coffee, you can find a lot of products that are both made commercially and home-made from this very famous Colombian product, like wines, cookies, candies, milk-based desserts like \"arequipe\", ice-cream, etc.\n</p><p>Colombians are famous for having a sweet tooth, so you are going to find a lot of desserts and local candies like \"bocadillo\"  made of guayaba (guava fruit), or the most famous milk-based \"arequipe\" (similar to its Argentinian cousin \"dulce leche\" or the French \"confiture de lait\"). That just covers the basics, since every region in Colombia has its own fruits, local products, and therefore its own range of sweet products. If you are a lover of rare candies, you could get artisan-made candies in the little towns near Bogot\u00e1 and Tunja.\n</p><p>The \"tres leches\" cake is not to be missed - a sponge cake soaked in milk, covered in whipped cream, then served with condensed milk, it is for the serious dairy fiend only. Another delicious dessert is 'leche asada', like a grilled milk.\n</p><p>Organic food is a current trend in big cities, but in little towns you can get fruits and veggies all very natural and fresh. Colombians aren't used to storing food for the winter, since there are no seasons in the traditional sense. So don't ask them for dried items like dried tomatoes or fruits. All you have to do is go shopping at the little grocery stores nearby and pick up the freshest of the harvest of the month (almost everything is available and fresh all year).  As for pickles and related preserved food, you can find them in supermarkets, but they are not common in family households.\n</p><p>Pre-Columbian civilizations cultivated about 200 varieties of potatoes. Colombia as an Andean country, is not the exception. Even McDonalds recognizes the quality of this product and buys them.  Try the local preparations like \"papas saladas\" (salted potatoes) or \"papas chorriadas\" (stewed potatoes).\n</p><p>All in all, in Colombia it can be fun to have the ingredients and the preparation of a lot of exotic recipes explained to you.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drink\">Drink</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37\" title=\"Edit section: Drink\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Drink\" title=\"click to add a drink listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '37', 'drink', 'Colombia');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>For breakfast, have a home-made hot drink. The choices normally include coffee, hot chocolate or \"agua de panela\". The latter is a drink prepared with panela (dried cane juice), sometimes with cinnamon and cloves, which gives it a special taste. In Bogot\u00e1 and the region around, is a custom to use cheese along with the drink, in a way that small pieces of cheese are put into the cup and then after they are melt, you can use a spoon to pick them up and eat it like a soup. Hot chocolate is drunk in the same way.\n</p><p>Colombia's national alcoholic beverage, Aguardiente (A.K.A. <i>guaro</i>), tastes strongly of anise, and is typically bought by the bottle or half bottle or a quarter. People usually drink it in shots. Each region has its own aguardiente, \"Antioque\u00f1o\" (from Antioquia), \"Cristal\" (from Caldas), \"Quindiano\" (from <a href=\"/en/Quind%C3%ADo\" title=\"Quind\u00edo\">Quind\u00edo</a>), \"Blanco del Valle\" (from Valle del Cauca) and \"Nectar\" (from Cundinamarca). There is also a variety of rum beverages, like \"Ron Santa Fe\" (also from Cundinamarca), \"Ron Medellin A\u00f1ejo\" (also from Antioquia), \"Ron Viejo de Caldas\" (also from Caldas) among others.\n</p><p>The water is drinkable straight from the tap in most of the major cities, but be prepared to buy some bottles if you go to the countryside. Agua Manantial Bottled water is recommended, it comes from a natural spring near Bogot\u00e1. Some advice, make sure you do not use ice cubes, or drink any beverage that might contain non distilled water, ask if the beverage is made with tap or bottled/boiled water.\n</p><p>If you are lucky enough, and if you are staying in a familiar \"finca cafetera\" (coffee farm) you can ask your Colombian friends not only for the selected coffee (quality export) but for the remaining coffee that the farmers leave to their own use.  This is manually picked, washed, toasted in rustic brick stoves and manually ground. It has the most exquisite and rare flavor and aroma ever found.\n</p><p>In Bogota and the rest of the country, black filter coffee is referred to as \"tinto\" - confusing if you were expecting red wine.\n</p><p>Also, you can find specialized places where you can drink coffee with many different combinations (like Juan Valdez Caf\u00e9 or Oma), hot or frozen preparations.\n</p><p>Commercially, you can find a lot of products made out of coffee too like wines, ice-creams, soda-pops and other beverages.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Sleep\">Sleep</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Sleep\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Sleep\" title=\"click to add a sleep listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '38', 'sleep', 'Colombia');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>In Colombia you can find a range of options, bed and breakfast conditioned to western standards and <a href=\"/en/Hostels\" title=\"Hostels\">hostels</a> to five-star hotels.

They do not target tourists specifically, but running up against an illegal rural roadblock in more dangerous departments is possible.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Kidnappings\">Kidnappings</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=46\" title=\"Edit section: Kidnappings\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At the end of the 90s and in the early 2000s, kidnapping became one of the most cost-effective ways of financing for the guerrillas of the FARC and the ELN and other armed groups but, thanks to improvements in security and the progressive weakening of the guerrillas, criminal organizations, and other armed groups, the number of kidnappings in Colombia has been constantly declining. 3,000 Kidnappings took place in 2000 while 229 cases occurred in 2011. The number of kidnappings continues to decline. Kidnappings are still a problem in some southern departments like <a href=\"/en/Cauca\" title=\"Cauca\">Cauca</a> and <a href=\"/en/Caquet%C3%A1\" title=\"Caquet\u00e1\">Caquet\u00e1</a>. Colombia happily no longer has the highest rate of kidnappings in the world. Colombian law makes the payment of ransom illegal.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Guerrillas\">Guerrillas</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47\" title=\"Edit section: Guerrillas\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>After four years of negotiations, in 2016 the Colombian government signed a peace deal with the FARC, ending more than 50 years of conflict. Now, the main guerrilla movement is the ELN, which is in the midst of its own peace talks with the government. The remaining guerrillas operate in rural areas, but their presence is greatly diminished. If you stick to the main roads between major cities and do not wander off the beaten track, you are far more likely to encounter soldiers from the Colombian army than guerrillas. River police, highway police, newspapers, and fellow travelers can be a useful source of information off-the-beaten-path.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crime\">Crime</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=48\" title=\"Edit section: Crime\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The crime rate in Colombia has been significantly reduced since its peak in the late '80s and '90s. However, major urban centers and the countryside Colombia still have very high violent crime rates, comparable to blighted cities in the <a href=\"/en/United_States_of_America\" title=\"United States of America\">United States</a>, and crime has has been on the increase in recent (prior to 2013) years. In the downtown areas of most cities (which rarely coincides with the wealthy parts of town) violent crime is not rare; poor sections of cities can be quite dangerous for someone unfamiliar with their surroundings. Taxi crime is a very serious danger in major cities, so always request taxis by phone, rather than hailing them off the street\u2014it costs the same and your call will be answered rapidly. Official taxi ranks are safe as well (airports, bus terminals, shopping malls).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drugs\">Drugs</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=49\" title=\"Edit section: Drugs\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Local consumption is low, and penalties are draconian, owing to the nation's well-known largely successful fight against some of history's most powerful and dangerous traffickers. Cocaine manufactured in Colombia was historically mostly consumed in the US and the <a href=\"/en/EU\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"EU\">EU</a>, and the United States of America is still the world's largest consumer of illegal drugs. Remember that the drug trade in Colombia has ruined many innocent citizens' lives and dragged the country's reputation through the mud.\n</p><p>The Colombian government has a strong commitment to fight drug production and trade. A previous president, Alvaro Uribe, with significant aid from the US government, led a policy of massively destroying drug plantations using chemical defoliants, achieving a great decrease in cocaine production. \n</p><p>Marijuana is illegal. Police will tolerate you having a few grams of this particular drug on your person, but you are flirting with danger if you carry much more. Especially in small towns, it is not always the police you have to deal with, but vigilantes. They often keep the peace in towns, and they have a very severe way of dealing with problems. Given Colombia's increasing aggression toward combating the drug trade, drug offenses are not treated lightly. If you are caught by the authorities possessing a controlled substance, expect serious problems.\n</p><p><b>Scopolamine</b> is an extremely dangerous drug from an Andean flowering tree, which is almost exclusively used for crime. Essentially a <i>mind control drug</i> (once experimented with as an interrogation device by the CIA), victims become extremely open to suggestion and are \"talked into\" ATM withdrawals, turning over belongings, letting criminals into their apartments, etc., all while maintaining an outward appearance of more or less sobriety. After affects include near total amnesia of what happened, as well as potential for serious medical problems. The most talked about method of getting drugged with scopolamine is that of powder blown off paper, e.g., someone walks up to you (with cotton balls in their nose to prevent blowback) and asks for help with a map, before blowing the drugs into your face. This is most likely a myth, and the most common method is by drugging drinks at a bar. To be especially safe, abandon drinks if they've been left unattended. While a pretty rare problem, it's an awful scary one, and happens most often in strip clubs.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=50\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Drink only bottled water outside the major cities. The water in major cities is safe. Most drinking water in people's homes is of the purified variety that comes in huge multi-gallon plastic bags (which you can find at any little grocery store). The coffee's delicious, though, so why not just start that habit!\n</p><p><a href=\"/en/Tropical_diseases\" title=\"Tropical diseases\">Tropical diseases</a> are a concern in lowland parts of the country, and more so outside of major cities. Mosquitos carry <a href=\"/en/Malaria\" title=\"Malaria\">malaria</a>, <a href=\"/en/Yellow_fever\" title=\"Yellow fever\">Yellow fever</a>, and <a href=\"/en/Dengue_fever\" title=\"Dengue fever\">Dengue</a>, and infection rates are similar to other lowland parts of <a href=\"/en/South_America\" title=\"South America\">South America</a> (i.e., much lower than in sub-Saharan Africa). Yellow fever has a vaccine, so get it\u2014it's required for entry to many national parks, anyway. Dengue is not preventable beyond avoiding mosquito bites, so using bug spray regularly in lowland rural areas is good sense.\n</p><p>Malaria is the one that can kill you within 24 hours of infection, so trips outside <a href=\"/en/Bogot%C3%A1\" title=\"Bogot\u00e1\">Bogot\u00e1</a>, <a href=\"/en/Medell%C3%ADn\" title=\"Medell\u00edn\">Medell\u00edn</a>, <a href=\"/en/Cartagena_(Colombia)\" title=\"Cartagena (Colombia)\">Cartagena</a>, and the <a href=\"/en/Andino\" title=\"Andino\">Andean region</a> warrant use of antimalarials, which can be bought <i>very</i> cheaply without a prescription from a <i>droguer\u00eda</i>, which are everywhere in any city of any size throughout the country. Ask for Doxycicline tablets at a dosage of 100 mg, with the number being 30 days plus the number of days in a malarial area (so you can start 1-2 days in advance, and take it daily continuing for 4 weeks past the end of your trip). The phrase you want is: <i>doxiciclina, cien miligramos, [number] pastillas</i>. Using some bug spray in the evening serves as a bit of extra protection.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Respect\">Respect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=51\" title=\"Edit section: Respect\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Colombians are acutely aware of their country's bad reputation, and tactless remarks about the history of violence might earn you a snide remark (likely regarding your country of origin) and an abrupt end to the conversation. However, Colombians eventually become willing to discuss these topics once they feel comfortable enough with someone.\n</p><p>Colombians are more formal than much of Latin America. Make a point to say \"please\" (\"Por favor\" or \"H\u00e1game el favor\") and \"thank you\" (\"muchas gracias\") for anything, to anyone. When addressed, the proper response is \"\u00bfSe\u00f1ora?\" or \"\u00bfSe\u00f1or?\" In parts of the country (especially <a href=\"/en/Boyac%C3%A1\" title=\"Boyac\u00e1\">Boyac\u00e1</a>) Colombians can be formal to the point of anachronism, calling strangers \"Su merced\" (your Mercy!) in place of usted. The one (much) more informal part of the country is along the <a href=\"/en/Costa_Norte_(Colombia)\" title=\"Costa Norte (Colombia)\">Caribbean coast</a>, where referring to people just as \"chico\" can be more the norm\u2014but take your cues from those around you.\n</p><p>Race is not a hot issue in Colombia, since whites, criollos, and mestizos (mixed race) blend naturally with natives and Afro-Colombians in everyday life (education, living, politics, marriage).  Differences between white foreigners are not dwelled upon: expect to be called \"gringo\" even if you are, say, Russian. Unless context includes anger, it's not meant to be offensive. If you are black, you will probably be referred to as \"negro\" or \"moreno,\" which also are not considered at all offensive. Asians are usually called \"chino\" (Chinese), regardless of actual background. Confusingly, Colombians also occasionally refer to children as chinos (\"kids\"); this use comes from Chibcha, an indigenous language. Even more confusingly, Colombians refer to blondes and redheads as \"monos\" (monkeys). It sounds offensive, but actually ranges from neutral to affectionate. \n</p><p>Colombians have the mannerism of pointing to objects with their chins; pointing to a person or even an object with your finger can be considered rude.\n</p><p>Avoid indicating a person's height using your hand palm down, as this is considered reserved for animals or inanimate objects. If you must, use your palm facing sidewards with the bottom of the hand expressing the height.\n</p><p>Colombians dance a lot. Anyone will be glad to teach you how to dance, and they will not expect you to do it correctly, since they have been practicing every weekend for most of their lives. Colombian night life centers mostly on dancing, and bars where people sit or stand are less common outside major cities. \n</p><p>Despite the sensual movements, dancing is normally not intended as flirtation. Here you could find salsa being danced at a children's \"pi\u00f1ata\" party, or even at parties for older people. North Americans and Europeans could find this odd or confusing because of the use of salsa and Latin rhythms in their countries. A Colombian dancing innocently could be misinterpreted, and in general, Colombian women or men are not \"easy\" just because of the way they dance. It is applied in the same way as in Brazil\u2014an almost-naked \"garota\" dancing samba in the carnival is not inviting you to have sex with her but inviting you to enjoy, to be happy, to join in the celebration, to join the exuberant shedding of inhibitions.\n</p><p>Regarding religion, most Colombians are Catholic, and it\u00b4s important to them to keep certain ceremonies and respect for all things related to religion. You could visit great architectural churches, even going inside, but taking pictures may be considered disrespectful during a mass celebration. Young people are more open to learning about other religions and debate on this subject, and you may even find a lot of them who may consider themselves as lapsed, non-practicing Catholics or even non-religious.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Gay_and_lesbian_travelers\">Gay and lesbian travelers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=52\" title=\"Edit section: Gay and lesbian travelers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most Colombians are Catholic, although you'll find that young people are increasingly quite relaxed about religion, especially with regards to social issues, atheism and agnosticism also is growing through younger Colombians. Public displays of affection are rare, though, and may elicit uncomfortable stares. Verbal and physical homophobic violence is not necessarily unheard of, and unfortunately less aggressive homophobia may be more widespread than what politeness masks. Overall, Colombian attitudes to homosexuality are pretty similar to what you find in the United States.\n</p><p>You can find more liberally-minded areas (at least about LGBT issues) in Bogot\u00e1's <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bogot%C3%A1/Chapinero-Zona_G&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Bogot\u00e1/Chapinero-Zona G (page does not exist)\">Chapinero</a> district. It is home to what may be the biggest LGBT community in Colombia, and is the focal point of the community's nightlife in Bogot\u00e1 (if not the whole country), with explicitly gay-friendly establishments such as Theatron (arguably one of the biggest discos in South America) <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.theatron.co/\">[14]</a>.

They're not hard to find in any city either, just ask your hotel or hostel staff where to go. Topping up is also easy, and can be done pretty much on any street corner.\n</p><p>The carriers you'll most likely see are Claro, Tigo, and Movistar. Claro is the most expensive (by a little bit), but it is said that it has the widest coverage in the country, if you expect to get off the beaten path; althougth the quality of service have been decreasing during the last years. Other carriers are Virgin Mobile, which uses the network of movistar, Exito Movil (cheaper rates, but harder for tourists to get, and Uff! M\u00f3vil, which uses the network of Tigo. You can get SIM cards for the latter two at Exito supermarkets.\n</p><p>NOTE: It seems that it is necessary (as of April 2016) to \"register\" your phone after you start using a Colombian SIM card. If you do not register your phone within a certain amount of time (about 2 weeks) your phone will be blocked and unusable with any Colombian cell network. To register you need to use a Colombian identification. So you may need to find a Colombian friend to do this for you.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Dialing\">Dialing</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Colombia&amp;action=edit&amp;section=56\" title=\"Edit section: Dialing\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h4>\n<table class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" width=\"400px\">\n<caption> Colombian area codes\n</caption>\n<tr>\n<th> # </th>\n<th> Departments\n</th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 1 </td>\n<td> <a href=\"/en/Bogot%C3%A1\" title=\"Bogot\u00e1\">Bogot\u00e1</a> and <a href=\"/en/Cundinamarca\" title=\"Cundinamarca\">Cundinamarca</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 2 </td>\n<td>  <a href=\"/en/Valle_del_Cauca\" title=\"Valle del Cauca\">Valle del Cauca</a>, <a href=\"/en/Cauca\" title=\"Cauca\">Cauca</a>, <a href=\"/en/Nari%C3%B1o\" title=\"Nari\u00f1o\">Nari\u00f1o</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 3 </td>\n<td>  Mobile phones\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 4 </td>\n<td>  <a href=\"/en/Antioquia\" title=\"Antioquia\">Antioquia</a>, <a href=\"/en/Choc%C3%B3\" title=\"Choc\u00f3\">Choc\u00f3</a>, <a href=\"/en/C%C3%B3rdoba_(Colombia)\" title=\"C\u00f3rdoba (Colombia)\">C\u00f3rdoba</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 5 </td>\n<td>  <a href=\"/en/Atl%C3%A1ntico\" title=\"Atl\u00e1ntico\">Atl\u00e1ntico</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bol%C3%ADvar_(department)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Bol\u00edvar (department) (page does not exist)\">Bol\u00edvar</a>, <a href=\"/en/Cesar\" title=\"Cesar\">Cesar</a>, <a href=\"/en/La_Guajira\" title=\"La Guajira\">La Guajira</a>, <a href=\"/en/Magdalena_Department\" title=\"Magdalena Department\">Magdalena</a>, <a href=\"/en/Sucre_(department)\" title=\"Sucre (department)\">Sucre</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 6 </td>\n<td>  <a href=\"/en/Caldas_(Colombia)\" title=\"Caldas (Colombia)\">Caldas</a>, <a href=\"/en/Risaralda\" title=\"Risaralda\">Risaralda</a>, <a href=\"/en/Quind%C3%ADo\" title=\"Quind\u00edo\">Quind\u00edo</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 7 </td>\n<td>  <a href=\"/en/Norte_de_Santander\" title=\"Norte de Santander\">Norte de Santander</a>, <a href=\"/en/Santander_(Colombia)\" title=\"Santander (Colombia)\">Santander</a>, <a href=\"/en/Arauca\" title=\"Arauca\">Arauca</a>\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td> 8 </td>\n<td>  <a href=\"/en/Boyac%C3%A1_(department)\" title=\"Boyac\u00e1 (department)\">Boyac\u00e1</a>, <a href=\"/en/Tolima\" title=\"Tolima\">Tolima</a>, <a href=\"/en/Huila\" title=\"Huila\">Huila</a>, <a href=\"/en/San_Andr%C3%A9s_and_Providencia\" title=\"San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia\">San Andr\u00e9s and Providencia</a>, <a href=\"/en/Meta\" title=\"Meta\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"/en/Caquet%C3%A1\" title=\"Caquet\u00e1\">Caquet\u00e1</a>, <a href=\"/en/Amazonas_(Colombia)\" title=\"Amazonas (Colombia)\">Amazonas</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Casanare&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Casanare (page does not exist)\">Casanare</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Vichada&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Vichada (page does not exist)\">Vichada</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Guain%C3%ADa&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Guain\u00eda (page does not exist)\">Guain\u00eda</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Vaup%C3%A9s&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Vaup\u00e9s (page does not exist)\">Vaup\u00e9s</a>, <a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Guaviare&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Guaviare (page does not exist)\">Guaviare</a>, <a href=\"/en/Putumayo\" title=\"Putumayo\">Putumayo</a>\n</td></tr></table>\n<p>Dialing Colombian numbers is complicated, with several systems.\n</p><p><b>From landlines</b>: \n</p><p>To call from a landline to another local landline, dial the normal seven digits.

After over a hundred years of Russian rule followed by seven decades as a constituent republic of the USSR, Belarus attained its independence in 1991. However, under authoritarian rule of Alexander Lukashenko (since 1994), it has retained closer political and economic ties to Russia than any of the other former Soviet republics. \n</p><p>Belarus and Russia signed a treaty on a two-state union on 8 December, 1999, envisioning greater political and economic integration. Although Belarus agreed to a framework to carry out the accord, serious steps towards implementation have seen limited success. The economy is completely dependent on <a href=\"/en/Russia\" title=\"Russia\">Russia</a>, and the Belarusian government is open to western government and people stance (if they are open minded and have good goals). \n</p><p>The country has not seen much structural reform in the past few years. Political and journalistic activity is tightly controlled. The country was the most developed republic (excluding the three Baltic states) in the former USSR, the country has a lot of remains from its socialist past and can not be regarded as materialistically backwards.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cities\">Cities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Cities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li> <a href=\"/en/Minsk\" title=\"Minsk\">Minsk</a> - the capital</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Brest_(Belarus)\" title=\"Brest (Belarus)\">Brest</a> - regional capital on the Western border with Poland with impressive architectural sights </li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Gomel\" title=\"Gomel\">Homiel</a> - also spelled Gomel</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Grodno\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grodno\">Hrodna</a> - also often spelled Grodno</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Nesvizh\" title=\"Nesvizh\">Niasvi\u017e</a> - also spelled Nesvizh, Njasvizh or Nyasvizh</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Polotsk\" title=\"Polotsk\">Polack</a> - also spelled Polotsk, Polatsk, the oldest city in Belarus (first mentioned in written sources in IX century) with some interesting historical architecture</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Lida\" title=\"Lida\">Lida</a> - a medium-sized city with a well-preserved medieval castle.</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Vitebsk\" title=\"Vitebsk\">Viciebsk</a> - also spelled Vitsebsk</li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Mahilio%C5%AD\" title=\"Mahilio\u016d\">Mahilio\u016d</a> - also spelled Mogilev, Mahilyow</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Other_destinations\">Other destinations</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Other destinations\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li> <a href=\"/en/Belovezhskaya_Pushcha_National_Park\" title=\"Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park\">Bielavie\u017eskaja Pu\u0161\u010da National Park</a> \u2014 on the border with Poland, this primeval forest is a UNESCO <a href=\"/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_List\" title=\"UNESCO World Heritage List\">World Heritage Site</a></li>\n<li> <a href=\"/en/Mir\" title=\"Mir\">Mir Castle Complex</a> &#8212; another UNESCO World Heritage site.

Plenty of them can be found within first few hits on Google.

Note that the agencies book hotels that they cooperate with and it is highly unlikely that they'll book you a cheap hostel from booking.com. Be prepared you'll have to pay a normal hotel room price, not a budget dorm.</li>\n<li> After you have settled the bill the agency sends an invitation and a copy of the tourist services contract to the Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in your country. Alternatively, if you note the agency that you plan to apply for the visa on arrival, they will send the documents to the consular office at the airport and a copy to you.</li>\n<li> In the Embassy you fill in the form, pay the fee and obtain a visa as quickly as you want (up to 48 hours).</li>\n<li> If there\u2019s no Belarusian embassy in your country, you can also obtain a tourist visa at the Minsk National Airport on arrival. The procedure might take from ten to more than ninety minutes. Take care to get ALL details right when trying to obtain a visa at the Minsk National Airport. For example, if an invitation is needed, then it has to be sent to the visa office at the airport at least three days before your arrival, and the invitation must fill all formal requirements, e.g. it must be stamped by Notarius Publicus. Visa applications delivered at the airport are often rejected, and in this case the visitor will be sent back with the first possible plane. While waiting for the plane the visitor will be kept in a room under strict police control, without food and with drinking water available only from a sink at the toilet. </li></ol>\n<p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.minskguide.travel/belarus_travel_tips/belarus_immigration/minsk_airport_hazards.html\">Several tips</a> on applying in MSQ Airport will save you precious time.\n</p>\n<ol><li> After having obtained a short-term visa (valid for 30 days and cannot be extended) you arrive in Belarus (e.g. in Minsk) and check in the hotel that has been booked for you.</li>\n<li> You are registered in the hotel for the whole period of your stay there automatically.</li>\n<li> If you want to rent a private apartment after this, you should register with the local Migration and Citizenship Department OGIM (you can learn details in your travel agency).

It adds over an hour to the trip, but other than that, the officials are efficient and friendly. \n</p><p>On a local train between two border towns, chances are high that you will be accompanied/befriended by women trading underpants, soap powder, strawberries, cigarettes etc across the border. They may be friendly and casual or (leaving Belarus) they might put pressure on you to help them in their trade by carrying cigarettes over the border for them - the idea is that you buy it cheap in Belarus and that you resell it to them once you're in Poland. Chances are also good that their friendly mafia boss is with them and you'll all travel together in the same train carriage, so chances of you getting away and reselling the cigarettes independently are probably weak. Instead, just smile, use your common sense and probably best not to provoke them. If you take their cigarettes, make sure not to take more than a legal allowance and return them to the women in Poland. Don't expect to be paid for it. Don't look to the border guards for help. They know the women traders and seem to have some informal deal with them (e.g. not being strict about visas, etc) - the Belarus border guards are worried only about political subversives; they have higher priorities than defending you against women trading underpants and cigarettes.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>At the <a href=\"/en/Terespol\" title=\"Terespol\">Terespol</a>/<a href=\"/en/Brest_(Belarus)\" title=\"Brest (Belarus)\">Brest</a> crossing, there are about six different controls. \nThe Polish side seems to work quite slowly.

Both languages are part of the Slavic language family and are closely related, and there are many similarities in those languages. According to the 2009 official census, 53.2% of Belarusian residents considered Belarusian to be their native language. However only 23% predominantly speak it at home, and these are for the most part older inhabitants of rural villages where the intense Russification of the soviet era was less strongly felt. Polish is spoken in the western parts, especially around <a href=\"/en/Grodno\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Grodno\">Hrodna</a>. But most local Poles use their own dialect with Belarusian as the base and with only some Polish words and sounds. There is a similar mixture of Belarusian and Russian, called \u0422\u0440\u0430\u0441\u044f\u043d\u043a\u0430 (Trasianka). Towards Belarus' southern (particularly southwestern) border, <a href=\"/en/Ukrainian_phrasebook\" title=\"Ukrainian phrasebook\">Ukrainian</a> will occasionally be spoken, but is much less common than Belarusian and Russian. \n</p><p>At least some knowledge of Russian is essential for an independent traveller, but if you do know Russian, you'll find that it, rather than Belarusian, will get you everything you need. There is little practical point in learning Belarusian, unless you want to impress the cultural elite or join the political opposition (which is highly inadvisable). The authorities (and some of the trendier shops in big cities like Minsk) make an effort to use Belarusian, but it's mostly a token one and any information you actually need to know will most likely be in Russian. Expect to speak Russian, not Belarusian, in shops, museums, and on the street. Information in museums and other places of cultural interest will most likely also be in Belarusian, but if you have a good working knowlege of Russian, then understanding the gist of Belarusian speech is not difficult. Reading presents a bit more of a problem as Belarusian spelling rules are different to Russian, but if you say the word out loud with a Russian accent, in most cases the equivalent Russian word will become obvious.\n</p><p>English is not widely spoken in Belarus, especially not by people born before the fall of communism. Although in theory everyone learns English in school from the age of 7, in practice a combination of bad teaching and having no one to practice on means that a lot of people have a very good vocabulary and can understand you if you talk slowly, but will struggle to put together a sentence in reply. Among the older generation, German is a more common second language. As Western tourists are so rare, every English speaker you come across will jump at the chance to practice their English on you, and if you agree, then it may very quickly become quite a big commitment on your part.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See\">See</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=34\" title=\"Edit section: See\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#See\" title=\"click to add a see listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '34', 'see', 'Belarus');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:302px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Sarja_Church_in_northern_Belarus.jpeg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/cb/Sarja_Church_in_northern_Belarus.jpeg/300px-Sarja_Church_in_northern_Belarus.jpeg\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/cb/Sarja_Church_in_northern_Belarus.jpeg/450px-Sarja_Church_in_northern_Belarus.jpeg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/c/cb/Sarja_Church_in_northern_Belarus.jpeg/600px-Sarja_Church_in_northern_Belarus.jpeg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2400\" data-file-height=\"3600\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Sarja_Church_in_northern_Belarus.jpeg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>A Neo-Gothic Catholic church built in Sarja village to the design of architect Gustav Schacht in 19th century.

But the main methods of traditional Belarusian cuisine are carefully kept by the people. \nCommon in Belarusian cuisine were dishes from potato which is called among people \"the second bread\". The Belarusians bring fame to their beloved potato in their verses, songs, dances. There are special potato cafes in the country where you can try various potato dishes. Potato is included into many salads and it is served together with mushrooms and/or meat; different <i>pirazhki</i> (patties) and baked puddings are made from it. The most popular among the Belarusians is traditional <i>draniki</i> (known as \"latkes\" to North Americans, but eaten only with sour cream, never apple sauce), thick pancakes prepared from shredded potatoes. A wide spread of potato dishes in Belarusian cuisine can be explained by natural climatic conditions of Belarus which are propitious for growing highly starched and tasty sorts of potatoes. \n</p><p>Meat and meat products play a major role in the diet of Belarusians, especially to the pork and salted pork fat. One of the people's proverbs says: \"There is no fish more tasty than tench, as well as there is no meat better than pork\". The salted pork fat is used slightly smoked and seasoned with onions and garlic. Pyachysta is one of the traditional holiday dishes. This is boiled, stewed or roasted sucking pig, fowl or large chunks of pork or beef. Dishes prepared from meat are usually served together with potatoes or vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, black radish, peas, etc. It is characteristic that many vegetable and meat dishes are prepared in special stoneware pots. \n</p><p>Among dishes from fish, the Belarusians prefer yushka, galki and also baked or boiled river-fish without special seasonings. In general, the most common seasonings are onions, garlic, parsley, dill, caraway seeds, pepper; they are used very moderately in Belarusian cookery. The national dishes are hearty and tasty. There are choices of fresh, dried, salted and pickled mushrooms, and also berries such as bilberry, wild strawberries, red whortlberry, raspberries, cranberries and some others. Of flour dishes, the most popular is zacirka. Pieces of specially prepared dough are boiled in water and then poured over with milk or garnished with salted pork fat. The Belarusians prefer to use whole milk, which affected some methods of making yoghurt and the so called klinkovy cottage cheese. In Belarusian cuisine, the milk is widely used for mixing in vegetable and flour dishes. \n<i>Myadukha</i>, <i>berezavik</i>, <i>kvas</i>, and beer are traditional Belarusian drinks.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Foreign_cuisine\">Foreign cuisine</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38\" title=\"Edit section: Foreign cuisine\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are several foreign chains in Belarus including McDonald's, KFC, and TGI Friday's.

Jaywalking is illegal and can land you a fine if you are caught. Although some Belarusians will cross where there is no crossing provided there are no police around, crossing at a red light will get you some very strange looks and is highly inadvisable when with locals. Pedestrian lights in Belarus, like much of eastern Europe, may allow cars to turn across your path even when the light is green for you. When this happens the cars are required, just as at zebra crossings too, to give pedestrians the right of way. However this doesn't always mean stopping, but more commonly hastily changing lane to cut in front of you. To get a car to wait, you have to walk forwards quite determinedly, but be aware that if the car doesn't stop you will have to get out of its way quickly. As a general rule, when not at a pedestrian crossing, cars will make no allowances for you and will not change speed or direction to allow you to cross.\n</p><p>Driving in Belarus is not for the faint hearted. Drivers will change lanes at will, often without indicating, and drive very close to the vehicle in front. On long-distance country roads with only one lane each way, some cars may expect you to move over to the right (onto the verge if needs be) so that they can overtake, and it is probably best not to argue with them. Also be aware that drivers may try to overtake when there are cars coming towards you, and that you may need to suddenly slow down to allow them in front of you.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Political_Unrest\">Political Unrest</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=46\" title=\"Edit section: Political Unrest\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>If you participate in a street demonstration with political banners, expect to be detained within minutes. Westerners especially should avoid any political discussions, protests, etc. due to the government's keen opposition to dissenting views. With that said, many Belarusians freely express their political views during regular conversation without fear of immediate arrest or some type of governmental retribution. Active demonstrations against the government are certainly inadvisable; however, foreigners should not feel unduly threatened by any restrictions on freedom of political speech. Aforementioned demonstrations can be identified by seeing a red and white banner, a white background, with a strip of red going horizontally across in the center, forming a white red white flag. If you see said flag, do your best to stay away from the demonstration.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Law_Enforcement\">Law Enforcement</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47\" title=\"Edit section: Law Enforcement\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>It is illegal to be outside after 11pm if you are under 18. Young people may be stopped and required to prove their age, and failing to produce a passport if asked to will be interpreted as being under 18 and you will be fined.\n</p><p>Security personnel may at times place you, as a foreigner, under surveillance; hotel rooms, telephones, and fax machines may be monitored, and personal possessions in hotel rooms may be searched. Taking photographs of anything that could be perceived as being of military or security interest may result in problems with authorities; these sites are not always clearly marked and application of these restrictions is subject to interpretation. \n</p><p>Belarus police organizations are well trained and professional, but severely restricted by an un-reformed Soviet-era legal system, corruption, and politicization of the police force and other government authorities. Sophisticated criminal investigations are often inconclusive because of a lack of resources and/or political will.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=48\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Historically, Belarus maintained an excellent health system. Call 103 for ambulance.

The fastest way to secure Western-level care is medical evacuation to the European Union.\n</p><p>Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious health concern in Belarus. Though the illness-level is the same as in the Baltic states. Vaccinations against this disease is highly recommended. You need to consult to a doctor first and get the vaccination before entering Belarus. \n</p><p>In Belarus, there is a big institute and lots of funding for studying the after effects of the Chernobyl disaster, which happened in 1986 in a nuclear power plant on the Ukraine-Belarus border, in the food chain. In principle, food inspectors check food not only for bacterial contamination but also for radiation levels, and except for the banned region within about 50km of the Chernobyl plant itself and a second hotspot starting from the point where Russia, Ukraine and Belarus all touch each other, and running roughly 100km to the North of this point, food is considered <i>safe</i>.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Respect\">Respect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=49\" title=\"Edit section: Respect\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Since Belarusian, Ukrainian and Russian cultures are very close and thus share much in common, many of the same principles of behaviour that can be applied to Russians and Ukrainians, are also applicable to the Belarus populace. Nevertheless, it is always necessary to pay respect to the differences between Belarus, Russia and Ukraine - their histories, national languages and cultures.\n</p><p>It is advisable to avoid the outdated name <i>Byelorussia</i> and not to speculate on whether the country's name is translated as \"White Russia\" - some of young and Western-oriented people can be offended by this. Nevertheless, most Belarusians who have received their education during the Soviet times, have nothing against this. There is a song \"Byelorussia\" performed by the Pesnyary band which was written in 1975 and is still very popular today.\n</p><p>The WWII topic is quite sensitive in Belarus. Every third Belarusian was killed during the war by the Third Reich soldiers and their collaborators, a powerful pro-Soviet partisan movement was organized in the country, and it has contributed a lot to weakening Nazi forces. These events are sacred for many Belarusians, so just avoid silly statements that the Allies have won the WWII alone: it is not true and is insulting for those who have lost their ancestors in the battlefield and perhaps know much more about those events than you do!\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Communication\">Communication</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Belarus&amp;action=edit&amp;section=50\" title=\"Edit section: Communication\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>There are 3 major GSM providers in Belarus, all of which offer prepaid SIM cards for Internet access and phone calls. \n</p>\n<ul><li> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.velcom.by/en/\">Velcom</a> - Has the best coverage</li>\n<li> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://en.mts.by/\">MTS</a> - Has good coverage</li>\n<li> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://life.com.by/en/\">Life:)</a> - Has the worst coverage of the 3 providers</li></ul>\n<p>You will need to show your passport at the point of purchase.

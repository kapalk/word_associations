France ceded possession to Great Britain in 1763, which made the island a colony in 1805. In 1980, two years after independence, Dominica's fortunes improved when a corrupt and tyrannical administration was replaced by that of Mary Eugenia Charles, the first female prime minister in the Caribbean, who remained in office for 15 years. Some 3,000 Carib Indians still living on Dominica are the only pre-Columbian population remaining in the eastern Caribbean.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dominica&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:512px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Dominica_Map.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d1/Dominica_Map.png/510px-Dominica_Map.png\" width=\"510\" height=\"751\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d1/Dominica_Map.png/765px-Dominica_Map.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d1/Dominica_Map.png/1020px-Dominica_Map.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"2021\" data-file-height=\"2977\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Dominica_Map.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Map of Dominica</div></div></div>\n<p>Dominica is too small for Wikitravel to need to divide it up into separate regions, but it is administratively divided into the 10 parishes of Saint Andrew, Saint David, Saint George, Saint John, Saint Joseph, Saint Luke, Saint Mark, Saint Patrick, Saint Paul and Saint Peter.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Cities\">Cities</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dominica&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Cities\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/en/Roseau\" title=\"Roseau\">Roseau</a> \u2014 capital</li>\n<li><a href=\"/en/Portsmouth_(Dominica)\" title=\"Portsmouth (Dominica)\">Portsmouth</a> \u2014 the second largest city in Dominica.

The \u201cTrou Quarre\u201d was the French name for the sandy cove north of Douglas Bay, but today it is written as Toucari. It is the site of the establishment of the first Roman Catholic chapel in the north of Dominica by French missionaries early in the 18th century.

Generally well-marked in yellow and blue, it includes sections that overlap roads, as well as well-marked wilderness trails.  It is divided into 14 segments of varying (but generally moderate) difficulty, most of them estimated at about 6 hours to complete.  Much of the terrain is lush rainforest and/or steep mountain trails, but some parts are on roadways. It goes through the Carib territory.  It is conceived as being walked from south to north -- the markings are sometimes a little less intuitive if you're going the other way (ie starting at a segment boundary and walking backwards).  </li></ul>\n<ul><li><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Morne_Trois_Pitons_National_Park&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" class=\"new\" title=\"Morne Trois Pitons National Park (page does not exist)\">Morne Trois Pitons National Park</a> \u2014 A <a href=\"/en/UNESCO_World_Heritage_Site\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"UNESCO World Heritage Site\">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>, it contains many attractions such as the Boiling Lake, the Freshwater Lake, Boeri Lake and Middleham Falls. Boiling Lake is a 12 mile round trip hike (8 hours), very steep mostly on steps and switchbacks.  A guide is recommended for inexperienced back country hikers, the terrain is rough especially when wet (which it almost always is).  The trail is well marked most of the way.  The trail is indistinct in the Valley of Desolation but picks up again where vegetation begins. The hike is stunning and the bare volcanic mountain tops make for unforgettable views of rolling mountain tops and steamy volcanic vents.  Trail ends at the Boiling Lake, a 100 metre wide lake that is being heated by a volcanic vent and is boiling.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Champagne</b> \u2014  A snorkelling spot on the southern coast, underwater volcanic vents emit continuous streams of bubbles making the place feel like a giant glass of champagne. The fish and coral are slightly below average. </li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Glassy</b> \u2014 An incredible and short 2-3 hour day hike in the southeast of the island.  The trail begins nicely enough through some farm land and then plunges into a deep jungle valley then approaches the coast skirting steep cliffs to one side (not for those with vertigo). The trail ends on an old volcanic flow that juts into the ocean, waves roll all around crashing on all sides, little ponds collect some of the water from the crashing waves and some coral and fish make the ponds their home.  When approaching the edges of the cliffs be aware waves have been known to throw people against the rocks or worse yet pulled them into the ocean to their certain death.</li></ul>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Dominica_boiling_lake.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/e/e1/Dominica_boiling_lake.jpg/250px-Dominica_boiling_lake.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/e/e1/Dominica_boiling_lake.jpg/375px-Dominica_boiling_lake.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/e/e1/Dominica_boiling_lake.jpg/500px-Dominica_boiling_lake.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"640\" data-file-height=\"480\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Dominica_boiling_lake.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>The Boiling Lake.</div></div></div>\n<ul><li><b>Jaco Steps</b> \u2014  Ford the creek in Belles and hike into the a rain forest up the side of a nearly inaccessible forest plateau.

If you are on a low budget and have plenty of time then the bus will be fine (except on Sundays, or weekdays after the early evening, when the only bus running goes between Portsmouth and Roseau), although sitting in a bumpy bus for long trips on winding mountain roads is not the most comfortable thing to do. However, these buses are generally safe and timely; the local drivers know the roads well and are used to all the usual weather conditions. Buses are owned and operated privately and therefore do not have to adhere to any timetables and come and go whenever they are filled to the driver's satisfaction\u2013 ask around for approximate departure and arrival times, but know that they vary day to day. Most villages have three to ten buses (Portsmouth is the primary exception\u2013 it has dozens, possibly hundreds, of buses that perpetually shuttle passengers to and from Roseau) that go to Roseau (or Portsmouth, if they are from a village in the far north\u2013 ask the driver, though most of the buses that are advertised as terminating in Portsmouth actually will go all the way down to Roseau, operating as service from Portsmouth to Roseau) in the morning to drop off students or employees, and return in the afternoon with these same people returning home. In Roseau, all villages have designated bus stops that may or may not be marked by a large, red sign. Whether they are marked or not, all shopkeepers and pedestrians you are likely to encounter know the exact location of the stop for your destination. In stark contrast, in the villages, where there is only one bus route (to and from Roseau, or Portsmouth), buses leave from the owner's garage and tend to drive aimlessly around town until the drivers have collected enough money from bus fares to make the trip profitable. However, when they drive around town, they oftentimes circle back to a shelter, awning, or public area that the locals refer to as \"the bus stop.\" Occasionally, they'll just remain stationary there. \n</p><p>If they are not full (they usually are), buses will pick people up anywhere along their route, so long as they can feasibly pull over and let them onboard. Generally, there are shelters along the routes, either in towns that the bus passes through or at major intersections, where hitchhikers gather. If this shelter is along a bus route, you may get lucky and a bus with an empty seat will stop for you. Be prepared for some competition in claiming this seat. Likewise, buses stop anywhere within reason along their route. Though the hitchhiking shelters are preferred, asking the driver to stop will usually net an opportunity to get out whether there is a shelter there or not. \n</p><p>When taking the bus, remember:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Keep an eye on your belongings. Dominica is highly safe and crime is minimal, but there are pickpockets everywhere.</li>\n<li>Don't overpay. The only thing about these buses that are regulated by the government are the fares. Ask the other passengers what they paid; upon seeing a foreigner, the operator may try to squeeze some extra money from you.</li>\n<li>Ask the locals about the bus. Buses from every village operate somewhat differently in terms of trip duration, departure and arrival times, pickup points, and the location of their stop in Roseau. </li>\n<li>Be prepared. Taking the bus is quite the experience; you will oftentimes be packed in like a sardine, and those that don't like to be touched (which is inevitable on a Dominican bus) or are claustrophobic should consider hiring a car. </li>\n<li>Don't complain about the music on the radio, the close quarters, or any uncomfortable seating arrangements you find yourself in. Not only will the driver take personal offense to this (it's <i>his</i> personal car), but he usually won't do anything about what you say. Plus, the other passengers tend to laugh at you. </li>\n<li>Know a real bus from a fraud. All licensed taxi and bus operators drive vehicles have license plates that start with the letter H. </li>\n<li>Get on early. Before they go, buses will wait (either at their designated spot in Roseau, or somewhere in town when leaving from another town) to fill up. The best seats are usually the first to go, so grab them before somebody else does. </li>\n<li>Talk! Foreigners don't tend to take the bus, so your fellow passengers will inevitably be curious. Don't force conversation, but answer questions politely and follow them up with questions or comments of your own. </li></ul>\n<p>Taxi is more comfortable than the buses and may not be expensive, particularly if the fare is shared with 2+ travelers. Whether you use the bus or taxi, make sure that you clearly agree to the destination and price before you start the trip.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Get_out\">Get out</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dominica&amp;action=edit&amp;section=11\" title=\"Edit section: Get out\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Visitors departing through the airport are required to pay a departure tax.

It is understandable, though many travelers for whom English is a non-native language may have a difficult time navigating the native articulation. However, North American and British people generally have little to no problem understanding the local dialect. The native accent is less noticeable among the educated persons of Dominica, such as government employees and tourism industry personnel. The most widely spoken language, though somewhat frowned upon by the government and schools, is a creole of French origin. This creole is the primary language of Dominica and is the language of choice for interactions between natives. French, given Dominica's location between the French territories <a href=\"/en/Guadeloupe\" title=\"Guadeloupe\">Guadeloupe</a> and <a href=\"/en/Martinique\" title=\"Martinique\">Martinique</a>, is taught in schools and is a vital trade language for Dominicans. However, due to varying degrees of fluency, French is generally not considered a viable option outside of hotels and major cities such as <a href=\"/en/Roseau\" title=\"Roseau\">Roseau</a> and Portsmouth. Although the island is reasonably close to <a href=\"/en/Venezuela\" title=\"Venezuela\">Venezuela</a>, <a href=\"/en/Puerto_Rico\" title=\"Puerto Rico\">Puerto Rico</a>, and <a href=\"/en/Cuba\" title=\"Cuba\">Cuba</a>, little to no Spanish is spoken on the island, though imported South American products do often bear Spanish text.\n</p><p>All those who are proficient in English should have no issues in Dominica. French speakers should expect to have to speak a little English or attempt to decipher the local creole, which is mostly French in its origin.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See\">See</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dominica&amp;action=edit&amp;section=13\" title=\"Edit section: See\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#See\" title=\"click to add a see listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '13', 'see', 'Dominica');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The capital of <a href=\"/en/Roseau\" title=\"Roseau\">Roseau</a> has many restaurants, small shops and wonderful views of the mountains (to the east) and the Caribbean Sea (to the west).

As a rule of thumb, swim where the locals swim!\n</p><p>Swimming in rivers is pretty safe. There are no creatures in the rivers that will cause you serious harm, but, as always, there are pests such as leeches. Flash floods, while uncommon, do happen. If you notice the water change color, this may be because of dislodged sediment and thus could be an indicator of an imminent flash flood.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Dominica&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Tap water is safe to drink, but since it is sometimes drawn straight from Dominica's many rivers, it has a tendency to turn brown after heavy rainfall.

Nine days later, <a href=\"/en/Indonesia\" title=\"Indonesia\">Indonesian</a> forces invaded and occupied the former colony, with the tacit approval of the <a href=\"/en/United_States\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"United States\">United States</a> and <a href=\"/en/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australia</a>. By July 1976 the colony had been annexed as the province of <b>Timor Timur</b>.\n</p><p>Over the next two decades, Indonesia integrated the colony, with many significant positions of authority being occupied by Indonesians rather than the East Timorese. An estimated 100,000 to 250,000 individuals are believed to have lost their lives during a campaign of <i>pacification</i> during this time. \n</p><p>The United Nations supervised a popular referendum on 30 August 1999, in which the people of East Timor voted for independence from Indonesia. After the results were announced, gangs of independence opponents, supported by the Indonesian military, terrorised the population in a civil war that destroyed much of the country's infrastructure. A United Nations peacekeeping force led by <a href=\"/en/Australia\" title=\"Australia\">Australian</a> forces was sent in to re-establish a civil society and reconstruct the nation.\n</p><p>On 20 May 2002, Timo-Leste was internationally recognized as an independent state under the official name of the <b>Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste</b>.\n</p><p>UN peacekeeping forces remained and a large number of Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) began operating.\n</p><p>In 2012, UN troops were officially withdrawn and east Timorese police and army took over any military installations. Although there are still NGOs working within the country,  their numbers have been steadily declining over 2012.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Climate\">Climate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=East_Timor&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Climate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Timor-Leste has a hot and humid climate (tropical).

A single entry visa valid for up to 30 days is granted for a fee of US$30. Transit visas are available for stays of less than 3 days for a fee of US$20. There is no transit without a visa option in Timor-Leste. Visitors are advised to hold cash in US Dollars upon arrival. There are ATM and credit card facilities inside the airport or at border posts.  Note however that <b>\"visa on arrival\" is not available at the land border</b>, except for nationals of <a href=\"/en/Indonesia\" title=\"Indonesia\">Indonesia</a>. Those intending to pass through the land border must apply in advance for a Visa Application Authorization, which is then presented to an immigration official at the border.

You then queue up at passport control, who will put the sticker in your passport.\n</p><p><b>Visa extensions</b>  Extension after arrival is possible \u2013 at a cost of US$35 for each extension of 30 days, or US$75 for extension of 60 days. Extension of a tourist visa beyond 30 days requires a sponsor, East Timorese citizen or work-permit holder, to complete a Termo de Responsabilidade, guaranteeing your conduct and compliance with East Timorese laws for the duration of your stay.

There are few taxis in the evening so do expect an extra $1-$3 more on your trip, especially if it's really late and your destination is far. In night time women should not use Yellow taxis alone because of risk of harassment. \n</p><p>Since 2016 there is also a few blue taxis. They are run by Corotrans.

Initiated by the Ministry of Tourism <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.mtci-timorleste.com/en/\">[11]</a> in 2010, Carnival de Timor is all about fun, music and multiculturalism. Both modern and traditional costumes, East Timorese and foreign minorities, even embassies also participate in this annual festival. The parade start in a landmark and end in Palacio do Governo, greeted by bands and award for best dressed group. The crowd continued to dance into the night with live music and other carnival attractions.\n</p><p>Tourists in Timor-Leste are a rare breed. Simply traveling from village to village, you're likely to hear choruses of \"malae\" (the Timor-Leste word for foreigner) and folks will want to engage you in conversation. One could spend several days just enjoying the feeling of being a very welcome stranger.\nTimor-Leste is located at the end of the Indonesian archipelago, north of Darwin, Australia and at the base of the Coral Triangle, which hosts the highest diversity of coral and reef fish species on earth.\n</p><p>Timor-Leste offers a rich cultural heritage spun from tens of thousands of years of human habitation, the Portuguese and Indonesian colonial periods, and from the depths of a society which has cultural traditions as the fabric of that bonds society together.\n</p><p>Timor-Leste is well positioned for community-based ecotourism, which has been written into the nation\u2019s tourism strategic plan. The Nino Konis National Park (situated in the eastern part of the country) is a well protected area and considered as some of the last surviving zones of tropical lowland rainforest in the world with rich coastal environment. The national park accommodates bird-watching, diving, trekking and pre-historic archeological sites.\n</p><p>Atauro Island and Jaco Island in Tutuala attract divers, snorkelers and green tourism enthusiasts. Both destinations provide eco-lodge facilities with some support from local NGOs in the region. A must-see attraction is the local divers and fishermen in Atauro, who fish using only traditionally made goggles and spear guns. Atauro is also well known for its distinctive wooden sculptures and is an excellent place to buy variety handicrafts.\n</p><p>For more adventurous tourists, Timor-Leste offers what is simply world class trekking, which can be experienced near places such as Mount Ramelau (\u00b1 3000 above sea level), Ainaro, Mt. Matebian (Baucau) and Mt. Kablaki (in Same district), to name a few. \n</p><p>While trekking Timor-Leste, you can keep busy by looking for some of the 260 species of birds on offer (the entire continent of Australia has some 650 resident species), 32 of which are endemic and 8 of which are exclusive to the island of Timor and found nowhere  else in the world.\n</p><p>For example, the Timor Bush Warbler was recognized as a distinct species as recently as 2001 and it is likely that the elusive montane species can be found in the hills of East Timor. The Bush Warbler is one of the many endemic birds that will be the focus for intrepid birdwatchers coming to TL.\n</p><p>Portuguese fortresses, churches and other monuments are scattered throughout the nation. For history enthusiasts, Timor-Leste's resistance tourism which worth exploring are the Xanana Gusmao\u2019s (current Prime Minister of Timor-Leste) hiding place, Balibo (known for the killing of 5 journalists by the Indonesian soldiers), Santa Cruz (known for a massacre in 1991), Japanese caves in Baucau and many more.\n</p><p>Coffee had been the main export commodity for East Timor since the colonial period. To visit East Timor is to taste its coffee grown in several regions such as Ermera, Maubisse, Manufahi and Liquisa. Travel to the coffee plantations takes you through winding mountainous roads, until over 1,000m above sea level altitude, cool climate (as low as 15C), and greeted by smiling farmers who are more than willing to welcome you to their homes. Other alternative is to contact one of the organizations dealing with coffee for a field visit to their cooperative farmer member's coffee plantation. They are: CCT/NCBA, ELSAA Cafe, Timor Global, Timor Corp, Peace Winds<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.peace-winds.org/en/\">[12]</a>, PARC-IC<a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.parcic.org/en/index.html\">[13]</a> and Alter Trade Timor.\n</p><p>Timor's coffee is now well known across the world and amongst organic coffee drinkers. It is now even sold in Starbucks Seattle as 'Arabia Timor' brand. Several organizations are promoting East Timorese coffee as Fair Trade Coffee in U.S., Japan and South Korea. One Japanese coffee expert praised about Timor's coffee as, 'one of the remaining original species in the world today.' (Horiguchi-san, 2005).\n</p><p><br />\nTimor-Leste also produces various types of weaved textiles and products for export and unique souvenir.

All convenience stores and even some roadside stalls sell excellent coffee. Just as Scottish clans have specific patterns for their tartans, families in East Timor have Tais in specific patterns and colours.\n</p><p>Roasted coffee beans will be a great gift item. Note, some countries have strict rules about importing any food item.\n</p><p><b>Coffee</b>\n</p><p>Timor-Leste coffee is grown organically and tastes fabulous. Coffee was introduced in East Timor by the Portuguese. The local way of making coffee is to roast the coffee beans till they turn black and let out a great aroma. Low acidity levels ensure the excellent taste of East Timorese coffee.\n</p><p>A few of the coffee varieties like robusta have very high levels of caffeine. A late night cuppa might keep you up for hours, which might put you in a fix, as East Timor doesn't have nightlife options outside of Dili.\n</p><p>Be sure to buy your coffee in a traditional market rather than Dili's grocery stores, where the product will often be pre-ground and very stale.\n</p><p><b>Tais</b>\n</p><p>Tais come in different designs and colours, depending on the region they are from, and they represent a distinct family. In Dili you should visit the Tais market to buy Tais and local silver jewellery. Tais can also be bought from street vendors.\n</p><p><b>Local Handicrafts</b>\n</p><p>The other items that will interest you are ethnic woodcarvings, batik cloth and embroidered fabrics sporting regional patterns. The ethnic woodcarvings available here are somewhat like the ones you might get in Africa.\n</p><p><b>Markets</b>\n</p><p>A market can be found in every main town on the island. You may not find the huge array of shops in East Timor that you are accustomed to. These markets, however, cater amply to local needs. The marketplaces give the locals a chance to meet and interact with others on a daily basis. A walk through an East Timorese market will help you learn about the local produce of the region. Tourists attract a lot of attention so be prepared to be stared at. Also expect to be overcharged as many tourists before you have paid exorbitant prices willingly.\n</p><p><b>Dili Waterfront</b>\n</p><p>Along the waterfront, you will find many fruit stalls. These stalls are mostly run by women and are stocked with delicious local fruits. The papayas, mangoes and bananas are really tempting; make it a point to try out any unfamiliar local variety.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eat\">Eat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=East_Timor&amp;action=edit&amp;section=25\" title=\"Edit section: Eat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Eat\" title=\"click to add a eat listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '25', 'eat', 'East_Timor');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Timor-Leste, like the Indonesians, have a staple diet of rice and spices. The East Timorese palate includes a taste for several international cuisines in addition to the traditional Timor-Leste cuisine. Portuguese, Indonesian, Chinese, Italian, Western, Japanese and Thai cuisine have made their presence felt in Timor-Leste. Significant numbers of foreigners living and working in East Timor ensure a loyal clientele for these restaurants.\n</p><p>The staple food in East Timor is rice. Commonly grown food crops include taro, cassava, sweet potatoes and maize. Beans, cabbage, cowpeas, onions, tomatoes and spinach are well-liked vegetables. People also rear poultry, goats and pigs. Fish forms an important part of the diet and acts as a supplement to any meal. Most traditional East Timorese recipes use a generous dose of spices. Mangoes, watermelons, papayas, bananas and coconuts are the most commonly cultivated fruits here. Carbohydrates like sago or other grains form the main dish for many a East Timorese meal.\n</p><p><b>National specialties</b>\n</p><p>Fried fish is a very popular dish, with prawns being considered a delicacy. Curries are a standard dish, with chicken curry topping the list as a favourite. Several authentic Indonesian, Japanese, Portuguese and Chinese dishes find favour with many Timor-Leste.\n</p><p><b>National drinks</b>\n</p><p>Coffee is grown organically in Timor-Leste and the level of caffeine in this variety is very high. Those looking for something other than coffee can have beer, which is widely available in both pubs and restaurants in East Timor.\n</p><p><b>Tipping </b>  \n</p><p>Bills presented in East Timorese restaurants do not have a service charge added to them and tipping is not mandatory. If you feel like tipping, you can tip 10% as a guide.\n</p><p><br />\n<b>Explore the flavours of East Timorese cuisine</b>\n</p><p>Restaurants in East Timor and local food joints around this new nation offer the traditional Asian curries with their fragrant spice pastes and fried accompaniments. The East Timorese local restaurants specialise in fresh grilled fish and excellent curries, and also provide a chance to fully experience local cuisine and hospitality. Local food also lends itself to Papuan influences, so you will find yam and sweet potato on the menu when you stop at rural food stalls.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Drink\">Drink</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=East_Timor&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: Drink\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Drink\" title=\"click to add a drink listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '26', 'drink', 'East_Timor');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Numerous beachfront bars and nightclubs provide the nightlife in Dili.

Remember this sad fact when dealing with the East Timorese as the occupation will probably not be a distant memory for those who hold it. Speaking well of Suharto's Orde Baru or of the idea of East Timor becoming part of Indonesia may not be well received by the Timor-Leste people. Many East Timorese are sympathetic or even outright nostalgic about the period of Portuguese rule over Timor-Leste, where they were generally left to their own devices by the Portuguese colonial government.

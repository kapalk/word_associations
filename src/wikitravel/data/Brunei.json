Brunei subsequently entered a period of decline brought on by internal strife over royal succession, colonial expansion of European powers, and piracy. In 1888, Brunei became a British protectorate. It was offered the opportunity to join Malaysia as a state in 1963, but opted out of the Federation due to a disagreement on the amount of its oil income that would have to be given to the central government in Kuala Lumpur. Independence was achieved in 1984. The same family has ruled Brunei for over six centuries.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Holidays\">Holidays</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brunei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Holidays\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<ul><li><b>New Year's Day</b>: 1 January 2019</li>\n<li><b>Chinese New Year</b>: 5 February</li>\n<li><b>National Day</b>: 23 February (1 January 1984 was the date of independence from the UK, while 23 February is marked as the date for the celebration)</li>\n<li><b>Israk Mikraj</b>: 3 April, The Migration of Islamic Prophet to Heaven</li>\n<li><b>First Day of Ramadan</b>: 6 May</li>\n<li><b>Royal Brunei Armed Forces Day</b>: 31 May - 1 June</li>\n<li><b>His Majesty The Sultan's Birthday</b>: 15 July</li>\n<li><b>Hari Raya Aidilfitri</b>: Month of Syawal in Islamic Calendar (5-8 May), The Palace can be visited for 3 days</li>\n<li><b>His Majesty's 50 Years On The Throne</b>: 15 October (only in 2017)</li>\n<li><b>Hari Raya Aidiladha</b>: 11-12 August</li>\n<li><b>Hijri New Year</b>: 1-2 September</li>\n<li><b>Christmas Day</b>: 25th December</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Economy\">Economy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brunei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Economy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The backbone of Brunei's economy is <b>oil and gas</b> and the Sultan of Brunei is, famously, one of the richest people in the world with an estimated personal wealth of around 40 billion dollars.  Per capita GDP is far above most other developing countries, and substantial income from overseas investment supplements income from domestic production. The government provides for all medical services, housing, education and subsidizes daily needs like rice.\n</p><p>All sectors of economy are fairly heavily regulated and government policy is an odd mixture of subsidies, protectionism and encouragement of entrepreneurship.  Brunei's leaders are attempting to balance the country's steadily increasing integration into the world economy with internal social cohesion. It became a more prominent player in the world by serving as chairman for the 2005 APEC (Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation) forum. Plans for the future include upgrading the workforce, reducing unemployment, strengthening the banking and tourist sectors, and, in general, widening the economic base beyond oil and gas.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Culture\">Culture</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brunei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Culture\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Brunei is officially an <b>Islamic</b> state, with hundreds of large beautiful mosques across the country.  Sale of alcohol is <b>banned</b>. Bringing in meat, (other than seafood) which has not been certified \"halal\", (slaughtered according to Islamic law), is also banned.  \n</p><p>During the fasting month of Ramadan, many shops and restaurants will be open. However, eating, drinking or smoking in front of people who are fasting is considered rude and asking permission is appropriate. In 2014, <b>new law</b> had been passed by the government where non-fasting people <b>only</b> allowed to <b>take-out foods from all restaurants</b> and eat privately.

There is a large number of <b>foreign workers</b> who work on the oil and gas production or in positions such as restaurant staff, field workers and domestic staff. The male to female ratio is 3:2.

However, English is also used for important directional signs such as CIQ checkpoints, airports and tourist attractions.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_taxi\">By taxi</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brunei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: By taxi\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>There are only \u00b1 40 taxis in the whole of Brunei (2009) owing to the high rate of car ownership and usage. Since there are around 10 waiting at the airport and 8 in the Belait District, there is a little chance of finding a free taxi along the road, especially during morning and afternoon peak hours when they are hired by business people. Needing a taxi might require a phone call. The main taxi stand is direct north of the bus station in the capital with only a few taxis waiting. Taxis may also be available outside some major hotels.\n</p><p>Taxis are not metered since there is no single taxi company, nor any regulations requiring taxis to have a meter. Drivers have fixed prices for most trips, although the tariffs may vary between different drivers, or they will give a price for an irregular trip. There seems to be an app called Dart which is similar to Grab or Uber.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_tour_vans\">By tour vans</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brunei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: By tour vans\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Another alternative is hiring a tour van to drive you around Brunei, for example, for a whole day, or several hours.

Brunei's high rate of private car ownership means very few Bruneians take these buses, which largely cater to foreign workers. The speed of the buses are limited to 50km/h, but they remain quite efficient. Note that bus routes cease operation before 2000.\n</p><p>In general, the bus system around the capital radiates from the bus terminal in the central district. There are designated bus stops along each route, but passengers are picked up or let off at unofficial locations at the discretion of the driver. The unofficial mode of operation makes easy travel and entices patronage. Unfortunately, it is difficult to obtain some form of details on bus routes and timetables. Recent experience in mid 2011 prompted a small contribution in the form of pictures of the known bus routes at the time.(The pictures of the bus routes will be posted at a later date). There are 13 routes and the fare is flat B$1.00, which is collected by a conductor. The passenger can advise the driver the location to disembark. Sometimes, the conductor asks the passengers their respective locations to disembark and skips part of the route, to the dismay of passenger who wishes to catch the bus. This also implies that there is no strict scheduled time. It is quite normal to wait 30 to 45 minutes for a bus.\n</p><p>There is also an infrequent long-distance bus which runs between BSB and Seria through Tutong.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Talk\">Talk</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brunei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: Talk\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The official language of Brunei is <b><a href=\"/en/Malay_phrasebook\" title=\"Malay phrasebook\">Malay</a></b>; the official standard being the same as that of <a href=\"/en/Malaysia\" title=\"Malaysia\">Malaysia</a> and <a href=\"/en/Singapore\" title=\"Singapore\">Singapore</a>.

For unauthorised consumption, there is a maximum of 10 years' jail or a heavy fine, or both. You can be charged for unauthorised consumption as long as traces of illicit drugs are found in your system, even if you can prove that they were consumed outside the country, and you can be charged for trafficking as long as drugs are found in bags that are in your possession or in your room, even if they aren't yours and regardless of whether you're aware of them - therefore be vigilant of your possessions.\n</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<td>\n</td></tr></table>\n</div>\n<p>Brunei is a very safe country, with theft being uncommon and violent crime almost unheard of. However basic travelling safety precautions should be taken at all times. Brunei has mixed legal system based on English common law and Sharia (Islamic) law.\n</p><p>Brunei revised its penal code in 2014, imposing Sharia law in three phases. Currently it is still on the first phase (April 2017). The first phase of Sharia law includes only fines and prison sentences for crimes. The Penal Code applies to both Muslims and non-Muslims. However, many of the specific offences are applicable to Muslims only. For example, non-Muslims can be implicated for adultery if committed with a Muslim, consuming alcohol in a public place, close proximity to the other gender if committed with a Muslim, contempt of the Prophet Muhammad, deriding verses of the Quran or Hadith, indecent behaviour and disrespecting Ramadan (fasting month).\n</p><p>It is illegal for any person to consume food, drink or tobacco in public during the fasting hours of Ramadan - this can attract fines of up to B$4,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 1 year.\n</p><p><b>Possession of pornographic material, in addition to homosexual and prostitution activities, are illegal.</b> These laws apply to foreigners as well. There are severe penalties in Brunei including, in some cases, the death penalty. Some crimes may attract caning and lengthy prison sentences.\n</p><p>It is difficult to obtain tobacco in Brunei; travellers may bring in their own tobacco, but there is no duty-free allowance. <b>Duty charge on cigarettes is BND0.50/stick,</b> i.e. BND10 per pack of 20 sticks and BND100 per carton of 10 packs. Duty charge on other tobacco products may vary.\n</p><p>The carriage of live ammunition, including amulets, lucky charms, decorations, and other byproducts containing prohibited items, is a serious offence punishable by law for 5 to 15 years of imprisonment and 3 to 12 strokes of caning. This applies to all passengers travelling to or transiting through Brunei without exception.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"LGBT_travellers\">LGBT travellers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Brunei&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37\" title=\"Edit section: LGBT travellers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Travel Alert:  Country practices Sharia and is not a safe country for gays or lesbians.

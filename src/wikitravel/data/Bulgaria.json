Although it has traditionally not been regularly visited by Westerners compared to other European nations, this is beginning to change. It is a beautiful place, with a wide range of activities for a traveller to do. \n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Climate\">Climate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Climate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Continental in the interior; cold, damp winters with snow in the higher elevations; hot and humid summers. \n</p><p>Temperate on the coast; mild autumns, cool winters, mild springs and warm and breezy summers.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Terrain\">Terrain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Terrain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Mostly mountains with lowlands in north and southeast; <i>highest point</i>&#160;: Musala 2,925 m\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"History\">History</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: History\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Bulgaria's territory was inhabited by the Thracians (famed for their gold-making, fierce warriors, and the gladiator Spartacus) for thousands of years before being conquered by the Roman Empire and later the Byzantine (East Roman) Empire. The first official data of Bulgaria is in the late 7th century (681 A.D.), when Slavic and Bulgar tribes entered the Byzantine provinces of Thrace, Moesia, and Macedonia and together formed the Bulgarian Empire. \n</p><p>In succeeding centuries, the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires dominated South-East Europe, but by the end of the 14th century, the region was overrun by the Ottoman Turks. Bulgaria was subjugated by the Ottoman Empire for five centuries. Bulgaria regained its independence in 1878 largely due to the intervention of the Russian Empire, who clipped the wings of the declining Ottoman Empire in Bulgaria and elsewhere. It installed a minor German prince (the nephew of the Russian tsar) as a ruler of the newly independent country. The country's iconic heroes are all freedom fighters against the Ottomans: whether Rakovsky (\u0420\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438), who mixed revolution and literature, Vassil Levski (\u0412\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b \u041b\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438) - the Apostle of Freedom, or Hristo Botev (\u0425\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e \u0411\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0432), poet and fighter. \n</p><p>After a series of bloody and brutal Balkan Wars in which Bulgaria failed to annex Vardar Macedonia (which had a population that it considered to be ethnic Bulgarian), Bulgaria had the further misfortune to be an ally to the losing side in both World Wars. In the second half of World War II, it was occupied by the Soviet Union and became a People's Republic in 1946. Communist domination was brought to a swift, but (for many people) illusory end in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall. Although Bulgaria went on to hold its first multi-party election since World War II, essentially socialist policies were pursued until hyperinflation and economic meltdown drove the old guard out of power in 1997. Today, reforms and democratization allowed Bulgaria to become a member of both NATO and the European Union.\n</p><p>During Communist times, the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast was a favorite destination for travellers behind the Iron Curtain, hence the name \"Red Riviera\". Now, increasing numbers of western Europeans travel throughout the country, and many have bought vacation houses near the Black Sea or in picturesque villages. During the 2008 global financial crisis,  Bulgaria marked a decline in its economy of 5.5% in 2009, but quickly restored positive growth levels, in contrast to other Balkan countries. That said, the Bulgarians have the distinction of boasting the strongest and most stable currency in Eastern Europe.\n</p><p>Despite significant economic advances, the country is the poorest member of the European Union. Corruption, a weak judicial system and the presence of organized crime remain significant long-term challenges for the country's development and economic prospects.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Language\">Language</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Language\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The Bulgarian language is related to Serbian, Russian and other Slavic languages, but contains many international words. Bulgarians consider the Macedonian language to be a dialect of Bulgarian. This is politically controversial, but it is true that Bulgarian and Macedonian are very close to each other and a speaker of one language can mostly understand the other. Bulgarians use the Cyrillic alphabet. This can make the task of getting around the country somewhat difficult if you aren't familiar with this alphabet, as most signs are written in it.

Most buses from Western Europe will pass through Serbia, so be sure to check if you need a transit visa beforehand (Serbian visas for citizens of the EU have recently been abolished).\n</p><p>There are daily buses between Sofia and <a href=\"/en/Belgrade\" title=\"Belgrade\">Belgrade</a> with fares starting at around 20-25\u20ac. <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.eurolines.bg/?page=5\">[10]</a> <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://florentiabus.bg/en/\">[11]</a>\n</p><p>There are a few daily buses between Sofia and <a href=\"/en/Skopje\" title=\"Skopje\">Skopje</a> (around 5 hrs, around 35 BGN one way) from the main bus station in <a href=\"/en/Sofia\" title=\"Sofia\">Sofia</a> or from the square outside the central train station.\n</p><p>Arda Tur is a Bulgarian company offering services between Thessaloniki, in Greece, and various Bulgarian cities, including Sofia, Plovdiv, Haskovo, Blagoevgrad and Sandanski. They run three buses a day, departing from Thessaloniki at 08:00, 15:30 and 00:00. The last one also offers service to Stara Zagora, Pleven and Burgas. Usually they are late, but buses are comfortable, have a/c, personal t.v., and a variety of snacks is given during the trip. Employees speak little English, but they offer a good service.

Buses go from and to every bigger city (you might have to ask or be driven by taxi to the bus station) quite frequently (exact timetables information in English can be found at avtogari.info <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://avtogari.info/index_en.php\">[12]</a> or BGrazpisanie.com <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://bgrazpisanie.com\">[13]</a>); however, most bus station agents (except at the Black Sea and in Sofia) as well as the drivers will not speak or understand any languages except Bulgarian (and, if you are lucky, Russian) and the destinations will be written exclusively in Cyrillic. You can look up bus schedules for the Sofia New Central at the bus station <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://tis.centralnaavtogara.bg/guide/welcome.jsp\">[14]</a>.\n</p><p>Don't be surprised there are almost always no timetables in bus stops with exception of bigger cities like Sofia/Dupnitsa/Samokov/Veliko Tarnovo.. Also payment for ticket is quite confusing, because some drivers want to pay by entering the bus, others when you leave.\n</p><p>Travelling from Sofia to major cities in Bulgaria by bus is a good value. A one way ticket to the Black Sea from Sofia is around EUR 12-15. Several companies operate regular routes serviced by new and modern buses. Timetables and prices in English for couple of the major companies can be found at  GRUP Plus <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://etapgroup.com/grup/en/\">[15]</a> and Biomet <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.biomet-bg.com/?lng=en&amp;mod=passenger\">[16]</a>.\n</p><p>There are other bus stations in Sofia and also some private buses depart from their own personal station, but for travellers just looking to get out of town with the least amount of confusion - using the New Central Bus Station may be easiest.\n</p><p>Buses and Minibuses go from <a href=\"/en/Varna\" title=\"Varna\">Varna</a> and <a href=\"/en/Bourgas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bourgas\">Bourgas</a> along the coastline, passing or going to all Bulgarian Black Sea tourist resorts.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_train_2\">By train</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: By train\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Travelling by train is inexpensive, but also slower than by bus. Trains are most useful when travelling along the two major train routes: <a href=\"/en/Sofia\" title=\"Sofia\">Sofia</a> - <a href=\"/en/Varna\" title=\"Varna\">Varna</a> and <a href=\"/en/Sofia\" title=\"Sofia\">Sofia</a> - <a href=\"/en/Bourgas\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Bourgas\">Bourgas</a>. You can travel both routes overnight, but you should make your reservations early because these night trains are often fully booked. The <a href=\"/en/Sofia\" title=\"Sofia\">Sofia</a> - <a href=\"/en/Varna\" title=\"Varna\">Varna</a> route is particularly scenic. While the rail infrastructure is currently being refurbished with EU funds, it is still relatively backwards. Trains are still being pulled by rusty old locomotives, while you might sit in a second-hand East German (!) carriage for the intercity 'fast' train. \n</p><p>The official website of the Bulgarian State Railways <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.bdz.bg/\">[17]</a> is user-friendly and offers an easy-to-use online timetable <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://razpisanie.bdz.bg/site/search.jsp\">[18]</a>. Another train planner is available on www.bgrazpisanie.com <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://bgrazpisanie.com\">[19]</a>. Group ticket discounts are available.\n</p><p>There is little to no opportunity to buy water or food on the trains. Bulgarians are friendly, you may find food being shared freely amongst the cabin.\n</p><p>Rail ticketing in Bulgaria is still somewhat Byzantine. After buying round trip ticket before boarding the train on the return you have to purchase a reservation at 0.50 lev from the cashier. When purchasing the round-trip ticket on the spot, the outbound train is already booked but not the inbound train, as it is an open ticket valid for a month. This is presumably done to prevent the return leg from being reused. \n</p><p>ISIC card holders can receive 50% discount.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_taxi\">By taxi</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: By taxi\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Many taxi drivers know only limited English so it is useful to write out your destination or carry a map. Most taxis in Sofia have GPS units on the dashboard. Taxi fares in Bulgaria are not formally regulated, so they can vary wildly. However, there is a standard \"market price\" in each of the major cities. One should be <b>extremely careful</b> about using a taxi in Bulgaria. Especially since you are a foreigner, you can definitely become a target of unscrupulous taxi drivers. When in need, get familiar with the most well known taxi operators in your area, your route and expected bill. Generally the safest way of using a taxi is by ordering a taxi by phone. Some fraudulent taxis mimic others' logos and labels on their cars. Definitely avoid using taxis waiting at airports and railway stations! Sofia and Varna airports are exceptions, as they have contracts with licensed taxi companies. Currently only these companies can enter the airport area and pickup passengers - prices are standard. Even drivers working with legitimate companies may try to overcharge you, so make sure they turn on the meter, and keep an eye on it.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car_2\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=20\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>If traveling by car, it would be helpful if you can read the Cyrillic alphabet at least a bit. Most signs have the direction shown in Latin letters, but some don't.\n</p><p>If you are a foreigner, its best to rent a car. If you decide to rent a car note that for any minor traffic incidents causing bumps or scratches to the car, whether involving a third party or not, you must immediately call traffic police (phone number: 112) to register the incident, otherwise you will most probably find that your insurance will not cover the damage. In case of doubt, call the insurance company too. Check the Terms &amp; Conditions of your rental agreement closely. \n</p><p>If you travel by your own car, a <b>road vignette is mandatory not even at motorways but at all main roads too</b>. It costs \u20ac8 for 7 days and you can purchase it at border or at gas stations. It can be purchased online at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external free\" href=\"https://www.bgtoll.bg/\">https://www.bgtoll.bg/</a>.\n</p><p>Driving in Bulgaria can be a bit precarious - many roads do not have defined lanes, are not well marked, and are in poor conditions. Locals often do not observe speed limits and do not signal when changing lanes. \n</p><p>When travelling on the road Sofia-Greece, be very careful. There is extensive road reconstruction and you can meet some really dangerous drivers.\n</p><p>Modern four-lane highways connect Sofia with Plovdiv, Burgas, and Turkey. Highways to Varna and Greece are only partially constructed.\n</p><p>On all but the major roads, expect to find significant pot holes and uneven surfaces, thorugh to gravel roads with major holes on some routes. Due to the poor road surfaces, you will often find cars driving on the wrong side of the road to avoid these holes, so be cautious when driving around blind bends.\nDue to the state of many of the roads, it you aren't travelling on new motorway, or other major roads, then expect to travel at an average 30-40km/h when estimating your travelling time.\n</p><p>If you observe the rules, police will not bother you. Bulgarian police have white Opel Astra patrol cars, marked \"POLICE\" with blue letters - keep that in mind, because in the past there have been several cases of fake police officers stopping cars and robbing travellers. Should you ever doubt the authority stopping you, you have the right to ask them to identify themselves with a certificate issued by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (\u041c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0432\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0432\u044a\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0448\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 - \u041c\u0412\u0420).\n</p><p><b>Never ever drink and drive in Bulgaria!</b> This is always dangerous, and your first offence may result in a long prison sentence. The once-common practice of bribing a police officer to get out of a speeding or parking ticket is becoming the exception.\n</p><p>Car theft isn't much of a risk, but shouldn't be underestimated. In rural areas leaving your car should be safe, but in the big cities or tourist spots, it is advisable to stay on the safe side by parking either on the major streets or on guarded garages, where fees range from 6 leva a day to 2 leva an hour. If you plan to spend more time in one city, it might be better to rent a parking space, which on the average costs 60 leva a month. Most hotels have their own parking, and even at private lodgings it is often possible to park the car in the garden or so, just ask.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_plane_2\">By plane</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=21\" title=\"Edit section: By plane\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Air travel is still not very common in Bulgaria as distances are relatively short.\n</p><p><b>Bulgaria Air</b>, the national carrier travels everyday from Sofia to Varna and Burgas.

If you know any of these (or another Slavic language) you shouldn't have much problem getting by. Ancient Bulgarian (also known as Church Slavonic) is considered the \"Latin\" or mother language of the Slavs. Some words and/or phrases might even be understood by Westerners since Bulgarian has a number of loans from other languages (most notably French, German, Turkish, Italian and increasingly English).\n</p><p>Modern Bulgarian is difficult to westerners, as it has three genders, the infintive has fallen virtually out of use, and articles are appended to the end of either the noun (if no attribute is present) or the first attribute (example: <i>kuche</i> = dog, <i>kucheto</i> = the dog, <i>dobro kuche</i> = good dog, <i>dobroto kuche</i> = the good dog), functioning almost like an agglutinative language. Even though the language has lost the case system entirely, Bulgarian makes up for the difficulty with a complicated verbal and noun system (A verb in Bulgarian can have up to 3,000 forms!). It takes a short while getting used to the Cyrillic alphabet, a writing system of which Bulgarians are proud.  Be sure to be in Bulgaria for the celebrations of the \"Den na Pismenostta\" (\"Day of the Literacy\"). The Russian/East Slavic version of the alphabet is almost identical to the Bulgarian one.\n</p><p><a href=\"/en/Turkish_phrasebook\" title=\"Turkish phrasebook\">Turkish</a> is the second most widespread natively spoken language in Bulgaria, and it is generally spoken in areas populated by Bulgarians of Turkish descent.\n</p><p>It is also important to remember the fact that many Bulgarians - contrary to most nationalities - <b>shake their head</b> for <i>Yes</i> and <b>nod</b> for <i>No</i>!  It is better to rely on the words <i>da</i> for <i>yes</i> and <i>ne</i> for <i>no</i> than on head movements.  Bulgarians often use <i>ciao</i> for <i>good-bye</i> (instead of \"Dovijdane\") and <i>merci</i> for <i>thank you</i> (instead of \"Blagodarya\").\n</p><p>Most young Bulgarians have at least a basic knowledge of English or/and a second foreign language (usually Russian, but German, French or Spanish can also be spoken) and will often even take up a third one. Those born before the mid-1970s are most likely to speak Russian, German (because of ties with East Germany) or/and Serbo-Croatian and usually have limited or zero knowledge of English at all.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See\">See</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: See\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#See\" title=\"click to add a see listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '23', 'see', 'Bulgaria');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The <b>100 tourist sites of Bulgaria</b>, a Bulgarian national movement established to promote national tourism covers some of the more popular sites <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://100nto.org/\">[21]</a>.

The best time for hiking in the highest parts of the mountains is in summer, between late June and September as the snow is already melted and the weather is dry generally. In winter, snowshoeing and ski trips are possible between December and March, depending on the current snow and weather conditions.The main hiking areas are:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Balkan Mountains</b> - this mountain chain gives the name of the Balkan Peninsula. It stretches all along the country and is popular among the fans of the long distance hiking trips. One of the famous European Long Distance Routes (E3) follows its main ridge all the way from the west border of the country to the seaside. One of the three national parks in Bulgaria - Central Balkan National Park - is situated here.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Rila Mountains</b> - The highest point of the Balkans - Mount Musala (2925 m.) is situated in Rila. Beside it, the northwestern parts of the mountain are a popular hiking destination, rich to nature and cultural sights as the Seven Lakes Cirque, Skakavitsa Waterfall (the highest in Rila), Rila Monastery and the area of Malyovitsa. Rila National Park, the biggest in Bulgaria, is situated here.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Pirin Mountains</b> - Located south from Rila and close to Greece and the Mediterranean Sea, these mountains are famous with the biggest number of sunny days per year among the mountain ranges in Bulgaria. The most popular hiking area is Northern Pirin. Its highest peak - Mount Vihren (2914 m.) is on a third place on the Balkans, after Musala in Rila and Mount Mitikas in Greece. Another popular route follows the main ridge of the mountains, crossing a landmark, called \"The Foal\" - a very tiny part of the ridge, which is secured and accessible for hikers. Pirin National Park is established to protect the nature in these mountains. Pirin is also famous with a number of blue high mountain glacier lakes.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Rhodope Mountains</b> - This is the largest mountain range in the country, located near the south border of Bulgaria. The landscapes here are quite different than in Rila and Pirin - there is no such a jagged peaks, but endless \"sea\" of green hills and a number of small villages between them. Rhodopes offer a lot of opportunities for easy hiking in combination with getting to know the local culture and traditions. The area is inhabited from an old time and nowadays both Christians and Muslims live here and contribute to the unique local culture.</li></ul>\n<p>There is an extensive network of marked tourist trails available and this allows a large number of different routes.

The Lev is pegged to the Euro at 1.95583 Lev for one Euro (which is the same rate as for the former Deutsche Mark, to which the Lev had previously been pegged 1:1). 1 Lev is roughly US$ 0.60 and GBP 0.40 (as of 02/2016).\n</p><p>Shopkeepers and other businesses in Bulgaria will usually not accept foreign money, although many will accept the euro. Bulgaria remains a largely cash economy in the rural areas; but in major cities, credit cards are generally accepted and contact-less terminals are available.  \n</p><p>In most cities there are many money exchange offices which are marked with signs that say \"CHANGE\". Most are legitimate, but some may rip you off. For example, they advertise a very competitive rate on the outside, but on the inside, there is a tiny sign with the \"official\" rates, and these are much worse \u2013 so always make sure to ask how many leva you will get for your money <i>before</i> you actually hand it over, and calculate yourselves (e.g., using your mobile phone) how much money you would expect to get. If you now refuse the transaction because the rate suddenly changed, they will make all kinds of unjustified assertions (e.g., \"I already entered it into the computer, it cannot be stopped\"), but you if threaten to call the police immediately while raising your voice so that other tourists look your way, they usually will let go immediately.\n</p><p>It is much safer to exchange your money at a bank. Banks apply little or no commissions, and generally offer good rates, although they are slightly worse than at a (non-criminal) change bureau. Higher commissions may be applied to traveller's cheques. Old, dirty or very worn bank notes may be refused. <i>Never</i> exchange money out on the street. Beware of people on the street who offer high rates of exchange or who may ask you to make some change for them.\n</p><p>Over the past years the ATM network in Bulgaria has grown considerably, making it relatively easy to obtain cash from the numerous ATMs in Sofia, as well as in all other major cities and resorts.

In the summer, Irakli beach and Karadere beach (both located south of Varna) are some well known wild camping destinations.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Learn\">Learn</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=43\" title=\"Edit section: Learn\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>The oldest Bulgarian university is the <i>Sofia University \"St. Kliment Ohridski\"</i> that in 2008 celebrated 120 years from its foundation. It is considered to be the largest and most prestigious university center. There are many newer centres of education in Sofia, Plovdiv, Varna, Shumen, Veliko Tarnovo, Blagoevgrad, etc.\n</p><p>For most subjects, programs are available in Bulgarian or English, depending on the university. Elementary and middle schools are supported by local authorities budget. As with most nations, teachers complain about small salaries. Literacy is nearly universal. Bulgarian people speak mostly English, German, French and Russian.\n</p><p>Some of the universities that offer education entirely in English are the <i>American University in Bulgaria</i>, the <i>New Bulgarian University</i> and the <i>Technical University of Sofia</i>. The last one offers also degrees in German language.\n</p><p>The <i>American College in Sofia</i> offers secondary education in English.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_safe\">Stay safe</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=44\" title=\"Edit section: Stay safe\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Bulgaria is generally a safe country, and people are quite friendly. You should however use common sense when you are outside of the main tourist areas, i.e. don't show off that you have money, don't dress too touristy, watch out for your belongings. If in Sofia, try to avoid dark streets at night. Stepping in a pothole is a much greater danger in Bulgaria than getting robbed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Emergency_phone_numbers\">Emergency phone numbers</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=45\" title=\"Edit section: Emergency phone numbers\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The pan-European standard number <b>112</b> for all emergency calls is working everywhere in Bulgaria since September 2008. If, for some reason, you can not connect to 112, dial <i>166</i> for police, <i>150</i> for ambulance and 160 <i>for</i> the fire department. \n</p><p><br />\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Driving\">Driving</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=46\" title=\"Edit section: Driving\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Driving in Bulgaria can be \"nerve-wrecking\", as in any foreign country. There are a few modern highways. Some roads are in poor condition and full of potholes. The use of seat belts is mandatory in Bulgaria for all passengers, except pregnant women.  Take caution while crossing the streets. <b>Driving with your headlights ON is mandatory even during daytime</b>. If you are caught driving without having your headlights on during daytime, you could get a ticket. The fine is \u20ac25 (or 50BGN), so be sure to turn your headlights on. In case you get caught, explain to the police officer that you are a foreigner and you weren't aware of this law and let them know it won't happen again. It is very likely that they will let you go with just a warning.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Crime\">Crime</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=47\" title=\"Edit section: Crime\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>In general, organized crime is a serious issue throughout Bulgaria, however it usually does not affect tourists. Bulgaria is safer than most European countries with regard to violent crimes, and the presence of such groups is slowly declining. Pickpocketing and scams (such as taxi scams) are present on a wider scale, so be careful, especially in crowded places (such as train stations, urban public transport, near major tourist areas). If you find yourself suddenly surrounded by a loud group of people that create havoc, immediately move away from them, as someone may be trying to divert your attention, while they pickpocket you.\n</p><p><b>Car theft</b> is probably the most serious problem that travelers can encounter. There is also terrible customs bureaucracy involved if you enter the country with a car, and leave without one. If you drive an expensive car, <b>do not</b> leave it in unguarded parking lots or on the streets at night - these locations  are likely to attract criminals. If, by any chance you do leave your car in such a location, you need to be sure that the vehicle has a security system that will prevent the vehicle from getting stolen. \n</p><p>Travelers should also be cautious about making credit card purchases over the Internet on unfamiliar websites. Websites that offer merchandise and services may be created by scam artists posing as legitimate businesses. A recent example involved Internet credit card payments to alleged tour operators via Bulgarian-based websites. In several cases, the corresponding businesses did not actually exist. \n</p><p>Bulgaria is still largely a cash economy. Due to the potential for fraud, credit cards should be used sparingly and with caution - for example, in large supermarket chains or reputable hotels. Skimming devices, surreptitiously attached to ATMs by criminals, are used to capture credit card information and PIN numbers to make unauthorized charges or withdrawals; these practices are somewhat common in Bulgaria. If you are unsure which bank's ATM to use, a good rule of thumb is to use one located inside of a reputable bank branch. In general, it is best to use cash instead of a credit card.\n</p><p>On occasion, taxi drivers overcharge travelers, particularly at the Sofia Airport and the Central Train Station.  It is recommended that travelers use taxis with meters that have posted clearly marked rates on a sticker on the passenger side of the windshield; these taxis charge generally less than the taxis with no meters. Make sure your cab has a meter! One useful tip is to check the price for your trip from a trusted source beforehand, online, through a friend, or an official at the station or at a tourist bureau. If by any chance you are trying to be lured into a rogue taxi, it is best to reject the offer, or just simply walk off.  Likewise, if you are offered a taxi by a stranger which you did not request or hail yourself, it is best to not take it.\n</p><p>Bulgaria has <b>harsh drug laws</b>, and penalties for drug possession are generally more severe than in other European countries.\n</p><p>Do not exchange currency on the street! It is a common scam to offer you fake money as exchange in tourist areas such as train or bus stations. If you need foreign exchange services, bank branches offer good rates and no risk of fraud.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Animals\">Animals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=48\" title=\"Edit section: Animals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Stray dogs</b> are common all over Bulgaria. While most are friendly, there have been a number of accidents with stray dogs, so beware. In particular, watch out for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:rabies\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"wikipedia:en:rabies\">symptoms of rabies</a>.\n</p><p><b>Wild bears</b> and <b>wolves</b> can sometimes be seen in woods, so be careful.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Corruption\">Corruption</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=49\" title=\"Edit section: Corruption\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Corruption exists in Bulgaria as in many other European countries. For example, some policemen or officials may request to receive a bribe for certain action. If this happens, decline the proposal and ask for the name &amp; ID of the individual. Corruption in customs is also a problem, but tourists are usually not involved.\n</p><p>If you are ever asked for a bribe, or you feel that you are being exploited, you can either fill out an online query with the police at <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external free\" href=\"http://nocorr.mvr.bg/\">http://nocorr.mvr.bg/</a>, or call 02 982 22 22 to report corruption.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Begging\">Begging</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=50\" title=\"Edit section: Begging\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Unfortunately begging and random people trying to sell you stuff is quite common in Bulgaria. In the holiday resorts both in the mountains and on the Black Sea coast you may see people trying to sell you various things like roses and pirate DVD's. Often they can wander into the hotel restaurants in the evening. You should make it absolutely clear you are not interested in what they offering, so they leave you alone. \nIn the ski resorts there are many people who sell \"Traditional\" Bulgarian bells. They know when tourists arrive and how long they are staying for and will pester you all week to buy a bell. If you make it clear at the start of the week that you do not want a bell they will usually leave you alone (for a few days at least) but if you do not say no, or even say maybe they will tag you with a cheap plastic bell to force you to buy one later in the week. The bell men will suddenly become your friend for the week as they try to get you to buy a bell, but of course if you want to buy a bell make sure you haggle! And if you really don't want to buy a bell, by the end of the week your bell man will demand his cheap plastic bell back and won't be very happy! Don't feel bad about not buying a bell as they often charge extortionate prices unless you really haggle. If you do buy a bell however, you will find that the bell men will be genuinely friendly and  chatty people and really aren't all as bad as they seem!\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Stay_healthy\">Stay healthy</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=51\" title=\"Edit section: Stay healthy\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Health_Risks\">Health Risks</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=52\" title=\"Edit section: Health Risks\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>As a country with a temperate climate, Bulgaria does not present any particular health risks.\n</p><p>Air pollution may sometimes exceed safe limits, especially in large cities. That is more common during winter, when wood and fossil fuels are burned for heating. People with breathing difficulties, such as asthma, are at a greater risk.\n</p><p>If you are at the Black Sea, mind the strong sun at the beach, especially in July and August. Wear sunscreen and stay in the shade during the hottest hours of the day (early afternoon).\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Smoking\">Smoking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=53\" title=\"Edit section: Smoking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Bulgarians have a reputation for their smoking habits, and evading the fumes of cigarettes is difficult.

However, in some places the ban is not strictly observed.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eating_and_drinking\">Eating and drinking</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=54\" title=\"Edit section: Eating and drinking\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Most food is quite safe to eat. Make sure you wash fruits and vegetables prior to eating. Especially during the hot summer months, products such as meat and eggs may be more easily contaminated with bacteria, so try to buy food from clean and reputable places.\n</p><p>Tap water in most of Bulgaria is safe to drink, and natural mineral water is also cheap and widely available. Since Bulgaria is a mountainous country, natural springs are quite abundant and many villages have one or more mineral springs.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Hospitals\">Hospitals</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=55\" title=\"Edit section: Hospitals\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Healthcare in Bulgaria is relatively good. Conditions in Bulgarian hospitals may vary - from the very clean and sparkling, with all the latest technological utilities, to the downright drab, dark and cold. There are some new hospitals, and some very old, with old technology. Medical personnel is very good at their job.\n</p><p>Citizens of the European Union are covered by Bulgaria's National Healthcare System as long as they carry a Eurocard (or European Health Insurance Card), obtainable from their own national healthcare authority.\n</p><p>Dental procedures in private clinics in Bulgaria are of excellent quality. Many people from Western European come to Bulgaria to have their teeth done for the quarter of the price they pay in their home countries.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Medical_emergencies\">Medical emergencies</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=56\" title=\"Edit section: Medical emergencies\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The national emergency number is 112. If you need an ambulance, it may take a long time to arrive (up to two hours in the worst cases) - in Sofia they are over capacity and traffic is bad, and in remote rural areas road access may be difficult. If possible, consider using your own means of transportation to the nearest emergency center. In small towns service is usually faster.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Respect\">Respect</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=57\" title=\"Edit section: Respect\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<p>Bulgarians are incredibly friendly and very interested in talking to foreigners. Bulgarians tend to be far more open than some other Eastern Europeans and  engaging in dialogue with these people is much advised and worthwhile. In smaller towns, especially in the Rhodopes, people may invite you for lunch or even to sleep over. Often it is a pleasant gesture to give someone a \"Dobar Den\" when walking past a quiet stall or past a person. Kak ste (hows it going) will usually suffice for the younger generation.\n</p><p>As a rule of thumb for most countries worldwide, you should avoid topics involving politics and foreign relations, and on some occasions football (soccer) as well. If you are pulled in to such a conversation, try to stay neutral.  Remember that your own knowledge of local situations is unlikely to be as good as a Bulgarian's!\n</p><p>For certain people, Macedonia is a sensitive subject to talk about, but feel free to ask your questions, provided you do not discuss it with those more likely to take offence (i.e. nationalists and skinheads). Many Bulgarians feel that Macedonia belongs to Bulgaria, but unless you know the subject and the people you are talking to, just asking questions is the best option.\n</p><p>Most of the Bulgarian people do not feel anger or resentment towards Russians (unlike a number of people from other former Eastern Bloc countries), and Bulgarians tend to have a much better perception of Russians, however caution may sometimes be needed  in discussing issues regarding Turkey. Likewise, discrimination against Turks is widespread.\n</p><p>Bulgarians don't really do chit chat, so trying to make conversation with someone at a till in a shop will probably result in odd looks (either from not understanding or not wanting to engage) or they will just ignore you. Likewise Bulgarians are quite impatient and will often honk their car horn at you if you walk in front of a car, especially in winter in the mountains as they try to keep a grip on the road.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contact\">Contact</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=58\" title=\"Edit section: Contact\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Telephone\">Telephone</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=59\" title=\"Edit section: Telephone\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Landlines are available almost everywhere, via the PSTN (operated by Vivacom) or VoIP.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Mobile_Phones\">Mobile Phones</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Bulgaria&amp;action=edit&amp;section=60\" title=\"Edit section: Mobile Phones\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Mobile phones are widespread in Bulgaria - many people have two or three phones.

Broadband Internet is available through cable, ADSL, fiber optics and Ethernet connections. Prices start at around 15 leva for 10 Mbps.\n</p><p>Free WiFi is very widely available in big cities - in public areas such as cafes, parks, hotels and restaurants. When Bulgarians sit down for a cup of coffee, the first thing they usually do is ask for the password. Some gas stations (such as Lukoil) also offer WiFi, and there is an unsecured WiFi connection at Sofia Airport. \n</p><p>All mobile carriers (Mtel, Telenor, Vivacom, and Max) offer prepaid data plans at comparable rates. 4G speeds are offered by Telenor and Max in some large cities and Black Sea resorts. The other carriers are launching their own 4G networks in the next few months. 3G is available in virtually all urban areas, EDGE in the rest of the country. There is signal in all inhabited areas and on the major roads.\n</p><p>Internet cafes are available in most towns and cities, and in some villages.

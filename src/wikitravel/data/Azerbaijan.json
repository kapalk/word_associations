History, with Russian and Persian influence, has left the Azeris of Azerbaijan and Iran with some moderate differences. Minorities in Azerbaijan include Lezghins, Russians, Avars, Turks, Tatars, Ukrainians, and Georgians. Most inhabitants are Shia Muslim, although a long history of Russian colonialism has left many with very liberal, laisez-faire attitudes towards Islam and the country is staunchly secular. The government is a kleptocracy run by the Aliyev family and their allies. While the opposition is often sacked or imprisoned, it is not as severely authoritarian compared to Turkmenistan, Iran or the Russian Caucasus. Following independence in 1991, Azerbaijan has allowed western companies to develop its neglected, but extensive, oil fields, especially since the mid-2000s. \n</p><p>Despite this and related investments, Azerbaijan has its fair share of problems. Corruption is rife, and the government, which eliminated presidential term limits in a 2009 referendum, has been repeatedly accused of human rights abuses. Although the poverty rate has been reduced and infrastructure investment has increased substantially in recent years, reforms have not adequately addressed weaknesses in most government institutions, particularly in the education and health sectors, as well as the judicial system. \n</p><p>The <a href=\"/en/Nagorno-Karabakh\" title=\"Nagorno-Karabakh\">Nagorno-Karabakh</a> enclave, which is part of Azerbaijan, has been the subject of a war with <a href=\"/en/Armenia\" title=\"Armenia\">Armenia</a> that has left it a <i>de facto</i> independent republic, which is not internationally recognized by any UN member including, ironically, Armenia which \"supports\" it. Azerbaijan has lost control of 20% of its territory and must support some 800,000 refugees and internally displaced persons as a result of the conflict. Despite a 1994 cease-fire, Azerbaijan has yet to resolve its conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Occupied by the local Armenian troops to this day, this conflict has not officially ended and minor skirmishes are frequent, and this is a major source of contention among Azerbaijanis.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Celebrate\">Celebrate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Celebrate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>These are the nationally recognized holidays for people living in Azerbaijan.  \n</p>\n<ul><li>New Year (1-2 Jan)</li>\n<li>Women\u2019s Day (8 Mar)</li>\n<li>Victory Day (9 May)</li>\n<li>Republic Day (28 May)</li>\n<li>Day of National Salvation of Azerbaijan People (15 Jun)</li>\n<li>Day of Military Forces of Azerbaijan Republic (26 Jun)</li>\n<li>State Sovereignty Day (18 Oct)</li>\n<li>Constitution Day (12 Nov)</li>\n<li>National Rebirth Day (17 Nov)</li>\n<li>Solidarity Day of World Azerbaijanis (31 Dec)</li>\n<li>Novruz Bayram \u2013 5 days</li>\n<li>Gurban Bayram (Day of Sacrifice) - 2 days</li>\n<li>Ramazan Eid (Days after Ramadan fasting) 2-3 days</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Climate\">Climate</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=3\" title=\"Edit section: Climate\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Lerik_Azerbaijan.JPG\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/7/74/Lerik_Azerbaijan.JPG/250px-Lerik_Azerbaijan.JPG\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/7/74/Lerik_Azerbaijan.JPG/375px-Lerik_Azerbaijan.JPG 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/7/74/Lerik_Azerbaijan.JPG/500px-Lerik_Azerbaijan.JPG 2x\" data-file-width=\"1067\" data-file-height=\"800\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Lerik_Azerbaijan.JPG\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Subtropical forests near Lerik, close to the Iranian border</div></div></div>\n<p>Azerbaijan is known for having nine of the 11 defined ecological zones. Much of the country is temperate year-round. Nation-wide the average temperature for the year is 14-15\u00b0C (57-59\u00b0F). The Caucasus Mountains protect the country from the Arctic air masses that affect Russia in winter while the Caspian Sea shields it from the hot, dry air of Central Asia in the summer. Temperatures in the winter are mild (0-15\u00b0C/32-59\u00b0F) at lower altitudes and along the coast and drops moderately as you head inland and drastically as you head into the mountains (-20\u00b0C/-4\u00b0F is possible in the Caucasus Mountains). Summers range from warm to hot (20-40\u00b0C/68-104\u00b0F) throughout most of the country, although breezes off the Caspian make life pleasant along the coast. Nakhchivan is quite different, high and arid, summers here can easily surpass 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F) while winter nights often drop below -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F)...in fact the country's extreme minimum and maximum (-33\u00b0C/-27\u00b0F &amp; 46\u00b0C/115\u00b0F) were both recorded in southern Nakhchivan!\n</p><p>Snow is rare in Baku and along the coast in general while common inland and copious in the mountains, where many villages may be cut off during the winter. The southern forests are the wettest part of the country, with plenty of rain in late autumn and early spring. The western central coast is fairly dry. Lankaran receives the most annual precipitation (1600-1800mm/63-71&#160;in) while the region around Baku averages 200 mm (8 in). Baku is very breezy, much like <a href=\"/en/Chicago\" title=\"Chicago\">Chicago</a> or <a href=\"/en/Wellington\" title=\"Wellington\">Wellington</a>, most of the year.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Terrain\">Terrain</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4\" title=\"Edit section: Terrain\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Azerbaijan_mud_volcano.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d8/Azerbaijan_mud_volcano.png/250px-Azerbaijan_mud_volcano.png\" width=\"250\" height=\"376\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d8/Azerbaijan_mud_volcano.png/375px-Azerbaijan_mud_volcano.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/d/d8/Azerbaijan_mud_volcano.png/500px-Azerbaijan_mud_volcano.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"1453\" data-file-height=\"2186\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Azerbaijan_mud_volcano.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mud volcanoes in Gobustan.</div></div></div>\n<p>Large, flat Kur-Araz Ovaligi (Kura-Araks Lowland) (much of it below sea level) with Great Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag Yaylasi (Karabakh Upland) in west; Baku lies on Abseron Yasaqligi (Apsheron Peninsula) that juts into Caspian Sea.\n</p>\n<dl><dt> <b>Elevation extremes</b>&#160;</dt>\n<dd> </dd>\n<dt> <i>lowest point</i>&#160;</dt>\n<dd> Caspian Sea -27m (-89&#160;ft)</dd>\n<dt> <i>highest point</i>&#160;</dt>\n<dd> Bazarduzu Peak 4,466m (14,652&#160;ft)</dd></dl>\n<dl><dt> <b>Environment - current issues</b></dt>\n<dd> Absheron Yasaqligi (Absheron Peninsula) (including Baku and Sumgayit) and the Caspian Sea are ecological concerns because of  pollution from oil spills that date back more than a century ago.

Generally speaking, US and Canadian travellers should pack an adapter and tranformer for these outlets if they plan to use North American electrical equipment in Azerbaijan.\n</p><p>Additionally, some older buildings may be still equipped with Soviet-era outlets. The Soviet GOST-7396 standard was very similar to the current European CEE-7/7 \"Schuko plug\", but the pins were of a 4.0mm diameter, while the Schuko features 4.8 mm pins. As such, the pins of a Schuko may be too large to fit into a Soviet-era outlet, although the smaller Europlug will still fit. Although the Soviet-era outlets have largely been phased out, travellers who are particularly concerned with having the ability to plug in at all times may consider packing an adapter for the Soviet-era outlets too, just in case.\n</p><p>Also, make sure to bring your own automated voltage transformer because the electricity in Azerbaijan short circuits and \"jumps\" a lot and many items may get shocked if you don't bring the adapter.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Regions\">Regions</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: Regions\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div id=\"region_list\">\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:402px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Azerbaijan_regions.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/57/Azerbaijan_regions.png/400px-Azerbaijan_regions.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"351\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/57/Azerbaijan_regions.png/600px-Azerbaijan_regions.png 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/57/Azerbaijan_regions.png/800px-Azerbaijan_regions.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"1001\" data-file-height=\"878\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Azerbaijan_regions.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Regions of Azerbaijan</div></div></div>\n<table>\n\n<tr>\n<td width=\"32px\" bgcolor=\"#5c7a7a\"> </td>\n<td> <b><a href=\"/en/Baku_Region\" title=\"Baku Region\">Baku Region</a></b> <br />The political, economic, and cultural centre of Azerbaijan.

The embassy of Azerbaijan in Washington, D.C. will issue visas without a LoI, provided your stay in Azerbaijan is no longer than a few days. According to Azerbaijani law, foreign nationals intending to remain in Azerbaijan for more than 30 days must register with local police within three days of their arrival. Foreign citizens should approach the passport section of the local district police office and fill out an application form. The registration fee is AZN9.90. If you should fail to register within the first three days of your arrival, you are liable to a fine of AZN300. If you are still within the 30 days and happen to have a double or multi entry visa, an option is to hop over to Georgia and the period will start over.\n</p><p>It is now possible to enter Azerbaijan on an e-visa.

Heading out of Azerbaijan, this costs 26AZN and departs nightly from Baku at 20:00. The time of the trip varies considerably based on how long is spent at the border (longer when entering Azerbaijan). Be careful on your visa as the train does not arrive at the border until the next day. They will boot you off the train and make you take a taxi to the border control (50km away from the border) and then you need to take a taxi back to the border (50 euro, May 2014). This segment of track is currently being modernized as part of a project, financed in part by Azerbaijan, which includes the construction of a rail segment from Akhalkalaki, Georgia with <a href=\"/en/Kars\" title=\"Kars\">Kars</a>, <a href=\"/en/Turkey\" title=\"Turkey\">Turkey</a>. Originally scheduled to open in 2010, it is now planned to finish in 2017 connecting the railways of Azerbaijan with Turkey via Georgia.

It can be picked up at either side of the border (don't worry if they ask you to pay on the Georgian side - they turn up to pick you up. Insist on bringing your own bags across, however). Journey time to Baku should take about 8 hours. Be warned, driving in Azerbaijan is a <i>genuinely scary</i> experience. Virtually all drivers have scant regard for the rules of the road and the standard of the roads themselves is shockingly poor. It is emphatically not for the faint-hearted, so whilst the long train might challenge your stamina your nerves should remain intact. Check AZAL flights from Tbilis-Baku well in advance for some reasonable deals.\n</p><p>Return minibuses to Tbilisi can be caught at the indescribably chaotic bus station, which doubles up as an eerily quiet shopping-centre  (take bus 65 from outside Double Gate in the old town for the 20min trip, which leaves you with a 400m long dodgy stretch of road/highway with pestering taxi-drivers on which to walk: Cost 20q) or simply taxi it from the centre for approx. AZN15 (worth it!), which saves on hassle. Both buses and minibuses are available from this station direct to Tbilisi, price approx AZN12 for both. Bus counter 26 at very back of ground floor. The bus is a few hours slower and not guaranteed to pick you up once you cross the Georgian border, so minibus is preferable.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_car\">By car</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=16\" title=\"Edit section: By car\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The safest way to rent a car is to reserve it through rental offices at the airport or online reservation in advance through AVIS, Expedia and etc. While using taxi services UBER and Taxify are preferable, simple taxis may overcharge. If you are using one of \"London\" Taxi services make sure that driver turned on the counter. There are no card payments in taxi cars, except online payment on UBER or Taxify. There is no Lyft in Azerbaijan. The best way to reach the city center from the airport is to use Airport Express (Hava Limani Express) buses which cost about 1.20 AZN.\n</p>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_boat\">By boat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=17\" title=\"Edit section: By boat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>There is currently no ferry or cruise service with any other country on the Caspian.</b> Be forewarned that the much talked about \"ferries\" on the Caspian are simply cargo ships with some extra space to take on passengers. Getting a ride on one of these \"ferries\" is no easy task. First you must find the notoriously difficult to find ticket office, which basically keeps track of ships which are departing. If you manage to find the ticket office and manage to get a booking, you still have little idea of when the ship will depart. Give them a phone number to reach you and be prepared, they may call you an hour or two prior to departure...two days after the first departure the office gave you and the day before the second departure date they gave you! This is only the first of you troubles. After paying for your place on the boat (about USD50-100), the captain and perhaps other crew members will expect an additional amount to get a bed and a shower. You are expected to bring your own food. The crossing will only take 1 day (Turkmenistan) or 2-3 days (Kazakhstan). Most ships go to Turkmenistan, where ships must wait for an open berth...so you can wait 2-5 days on the boat just waiting for a place to dock! Unless you are on a <i>very</i> small budget or have a bike and especially if you are on a short time schedule, you should pay twice as much (c. USD200-250) for a one way airfare to Kazakhstan, Russia, or Tashkent, Uzbekistan.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Get_around\">Get around</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=18\" title=\"Edit section: Get around\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Khinaliq_road.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/b3/Khinaliq_road.jpg/250px-Khinaliq_road.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"187\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/b3/Khinaliq_road.jpg/375px-Khinaliq_road.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/b/b3/Khinaliq_road.jpg/500px-Khinaliq_road.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"1843\" data-file-height=\"1382\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Khinaliq_road.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Mountain road leading to <a href=\"/en/Khinalug\" title=\"Khinalug\">Khinalug</a>.</div></div></div>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"By_road\">By road</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=19\" title=\"Edit section: By road\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>The total of 31,800km of \"paved\" roads includes some all-weather gravel-surfaced roads and many \"unpaved\" roads are made of un-stabilised earth and are difficult to negotiate in wet weather.\n</p><p>Buses, minibuses (marshrutka), and taxis connect most cities.

Turkish is mutually intelligible with Azerbaijani, so people will likely understand you as long as you stick to simple words and speak slowly.\nDue to the political reasons (Russia's policy towards Azerbaijan is covertly hostile) many Azerbaijanis speak Russian reluctantly.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"See\">See</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=22\" title=\"Edit section: See\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#See\" title=\"click to add a see listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '22', 'see', 'Azerbaijan');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Atesgah_Baku_Fire_Temple.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/Atesgah_Baku_Fire_Temple.jpg/250px-Atesgah_Baku_Fire_Temple.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/Atesgah_Baku_Fire_Temple.jpg/375px-Atesgah_Baku_Fire_Temple.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/3/3f/Atesgah_Baku_Fire_Temple.jpg/500px-Atesgah_Baku_Fire_Temple.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"800\" data-file-height=\"533\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Atesgah_Baku_Fire_Temple.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Atesgah of Baku (the \"Fire Temple\") is a 16th century Zoroastrian compound near Baku.</div></div></div>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Do\">Do</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=23\" title=\"Edit section: Do\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Do\" title=\"click to add a do listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '23', 'do', 'Azerbaijan');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<ul><li>Visit Maiden Tower, Baku for wonderful views of the city</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Visit Gobustan <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external autonumber\" href=\"http://www.gobustan.info\">[5]</a> open air rock art preserve and modern museum located in Gobustan National Park </li></ul>\n<ul><li>Try to attend an Azerbaijani Wedding</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Take in the breathtaking views of Flag Square, Baku Crystal Hall and the Caspian Sea from Martyr's Alley</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Wander around the Old Town, Baku aimlessly - really try to get lost and soak up the atmosphere in this wonderful old town</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Visit the beautiful Palace of the Shirvanshahs (entry fee 10 AZN (Oct 2017), extra for camera)</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Walk along the promenade, just as the locals do</li></ul>\n<ul><li>Contrary to reports, Azeri wine is more than drinkable and is a pleasant treat!

Azerbaijan's oil production declined through 1997 but has registered an increase every year since. Negotiation of production-sharing arrangements (PSAs) with foreign firms, which have thus far committed $60 billion to oilfield development, should generate the funds needed to spur future industrial development. Oil production under the first of these PSAs, with the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, began in November 1997. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the former Soviet republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. An obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment in the non-energy sector, is the continuing conflict with Armenia over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics is declining in importance while trade is building with Turkey and the nations of Europe. Long-term prospects will depend on world oil prices, the location of new pipelines in the region and Azerbaijan's ability to manage its oil wealth.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Eat\">Eat</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=26\" title=\"Edit section: Eat\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"#Eat\" title=\"click to add a eat listing\" onclick=\"addListing(this, '26', 'eat', 'Azerbaijan');\">add listing</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2>\n<div class=\"thumb tright\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:252px;\"><a href=\"/en/File:Azerbaijan_Light_snack.jpg\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/5f/Azerbaijan_Light_snack.jpg/250px-Azerbaijan_Light_snack.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"197\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/5f/Azerbaijan_Light_snack.jpg/375px-Azerbaijan_Light_snack.jpg 1.5x, https://wikitravel.org/upload/shared//thumb/5/5f/Azerbaijan_Light_snack.jpg/500px-Azerbaijan_Light_snack.jpg 2x\" data-file-width=\"2112\" data-file-height=\"1663\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/en/File:Azerbaijan_Light_snack.jpg\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div>Appetizers and snacks.</div></div></div>\n<p>Cabbage, grape leaves, and eggplant wrapped meat (<i>kelem, yarpaq, badimjan - dolmasi</i>), kabab (<i>kebab</i>), rice with different variety of toppings (<i>plov</i> - It is said that <i>plov</i> is the king of Azerbaijani cuisine), <i>gutab</i>s and meatballs (<i>kufta</i>) are some of the several specialties of Azerbaijan. \n</p><p>Bread is a staple, and is quite revered by the people of Azerbaijan.  \n</p><p>Georgian food, in particular kajpuri (a cheese-filled bread), along with some Russian staples (borsh, creps) have become common throughout Azerbaijan.

Female travellers should not act surprised or indignant when their Azerbaijani male friends pay their bills at restaurants, open every door in front of them, offer their hand to help them climb down that little step or help them carry anything heavier than a handbag - this is not sexual harassment or being condescending to females. Male travellers should understand that this is exactly the sort of behaviour that most Azerbaijani girls and women will expect from them, too. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>When you are invited into an Azerbaijani home, make sure to bring them a gift</b>. Anything is fine from flowers (be sure to get an odd number of flowers, as an even number is associated with funerals) to chocolate (but not wine or other alcoholic beverages), and indeed something representative from your country. In Azerbaijani culture it is the thought behind the gift, rather than the price, that matters.  And if you really want their respect, thank your host for the invitation and compliment them. The host will make sure to make you feel at home, so don't take advantage of their kindness. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>When you arrive at the house take off your shoes</b> just outside or immediately inside the door, unless the owner explicitly allows you to keep them on. Even then, it might be more polite to remove your shoes. You may be offered slippers to wear. Do not worry that your feet will get dirty - the floors are just as clean as the walls - Azerbaijanis are very neat and clean people.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Azerbaijanis respect elderly people</b>, so in a bus, tram, subway and in other forms public transportation, young(er) people will always offer you a place to sit if you are an old(er) person as well as a handicapped person or a pregnant woman or have children with you. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> It is respectful to bend slightly (not a complete bow) when greeting someone older or in a position of authority.

For women, use \"<b>Xan\u0131m</b>\" - pronounced \"<i>hanm</i>\" (\"Mrs.\"). For men, use \"<b>C\u0259nab</b>\" - pronounced \"<i>jenab</i>\" (\"Mr\"). If they do speak English use their last name preceded by the appropriate English honorific \"Mr.\" or \"Mrs.\". The English honorific \"Ms.\" does not exist in the Azerbaijani language, as women are <b>not</b> distinguished according to married and unmarried status and addressing a young woman \"Ms\" would be considered inappropriate and offensive.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Things_to_avoid\">Things to avoid</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=37\" title=\"Edit section: Things to avoid\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p><b>Politics:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>At all costs, do not insult or speak badly of the president</b>, as well as the <b>Aliyev family</b> in general.

Antipathy and hatred towards Armenia and Armenians run very high.   </li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>At all costs, do not insult or speak badly of the country or its people</b>. Azerbaijanis in general have some very patriotic and nationalistic views of their nation and would view any criticisms of their country very negatively. To avoid getting onto the bad side of the locals, it's advisable to praise the country wherever necessary, and keep any negative sentiments to yourself. If you're in doubt, always ask. Azerbaijanis are always happy to explain things wherever necessary. </li></ul>\n<p><b>Symbols:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>Do not desecrate or insult the national flag.</b> Azerbaijanis will be very offended. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Do not mock or insult the national anthem.</b> Azerbaijanis will be very offended. </li></ul>\n<p><b>Religion:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li> Even though 95% of the population is officially <b>Islam</b>, Azerbaijan is officially a strictly <b>secular state</b> is by and large a<b>agnostic and non-religious nation</b>. This is true not only in large cities but even in villages and rural areas as well. Don't assume that anyone you do not know believes in God or has a passion for Islam or in other faiths. Investigations into people's faith are largely unwelcome, and outside places of worship, displays of your faith should be kept private. Any religious signs, flags, slogans in public are prohibited by law, and you might get fine or deportation for violation. However, it is ok to have small neckles with your religious symbol, just don't wear shirts or hats or cary a flag with religious symbols. Those with long beards may arouse the suspicion of the authorities. Respect that and you will also be respected.</li></ul>\n<p><b>Social custom and etiquette breaches:</b>\n</p>\n<ul><li> <b>Don't blow your nose during meals</b>, even discreetly. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Don't pick your teeth during meals</b>, even discreetly. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Don't put your feet up while sitting and try not to show the bottom of your feet to someone</b>. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Don't point with your finger at someone</b>, even discreetly. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Don't chew gum while having a conversation</b> and during public occasions. This is considered extremely rude.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Don't touch females without permission</b>. This is considered extremely rude. However, note that if anyone stepped on your foot they will immediately hold your hand for a second or so. It is custom and even strange to you people will do that as a sign of apology and respect. But prefer just to say sorry when you stepped on someone's foot, not everyone likes touching.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Don't bear hug or back slap someone</b>, especially in formal situations and occasions and with someone you just met and/or you do not know well enough. This would be a very awkward situation. Do not hug or touch female without their contest, it would be extremely rude. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Don't raise your voice or shout in public</b>, especially on public transportation. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Give a seat to women, parents with small kids, and elderly people on public transportation, try to hold doors for them, and give a right of way unless you are on the line.</b> It is custom in this country, and people around will feel disrespected if you will not do so.

If you do they may not respond in kind and they will regard you as odd. Smiling at a stranger in public is not done and will be considered inappropriate. Smiling is traditionally reserved for family and friends; smiling at a stranger without addressing them will be considered offensive, as they will either think that you are making fun of them and there is something wrong with their clothes or hair. Furthermore, an automatic \"Western smile\" (ie grinning) is widely regarded as insincere, as in \"You don't really mean it\". However, a sincere polite smile is appropriate and will be appreciated when addressing a person. Smiling is still very rare in customer service as sales assistants, public servants and the like are expected to look serious and businesslike. On television, news presenters, weather presenters very rarely smile. Hence the very common misconception about Azerbaijanis is that they are a cold people and never smile - they do, once they get to know you and become very welcoming and kind. </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Never refuse a handshake</b> it would be insulting to local people. Majority of male locals will offer you a handshake as welcoming. You also may offer a handshake while welcoming someone. However, it is not preferable to offer a handshake to a woman.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Public displays of affection</b> in larger cities and tourist resorts is tolerated but might invite unnecessary stares from the public. In more rural areas it is frowned upon and is to be avoided. Gay and lesbian travelers should avoid any outward signs of affection, as this will definitely invite unnecessary stares from the public. However overt displays of affection regardless of sexual orientation is regarded as inappropriate.</li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>You will notice how Azerbaijanis tend to keep their voices down in public places</b>. Do not raise your voice in a conversation. A decent silent conversation is the Azerbaijani way of doing business and will be much appreciated. Talking on a mobile phone on public transportation and in restaurants is considered normal, unless the conversation is loud and too \"private\". </li></ul>\n<ul><li> <b>Littering is considered very bad manners</b> and you may be fined.

For example (050) xxx xxxx, (051) xxx xxxx, or (055) xxx xxxx, or (070) xxx xxxx, or (077) xxx xxxx\nYou can buy cards for use with different operators almost in every store. (See note below)\nAll of them have LTE (4G) network.\n</p>\n<ul><li>Azercell is the largest one. To dial an Azercell number you need to dial (050) or (051) and then the number. Only with Azercell can you talk in the metro (subway) in Baku. </li>\n<li>Bakcell is OK. It works almost everywhere and is cheaper than Azercell. To dial a Bakcell number you need to dial (055) and then the number. </li>\n<li>Nar Mobile is pretty cheap but doesn't work in some regions. For dialling Nar Mobile numbers you need to dial (070) and then the number. </li>\n<li><b>If you need local sim card:</b> Since February 2017 it is impossible to buy a local simcard for a short time tourist. But Azercell offers \"Guest Pack\" sim, which costs 17 AZN ($10) and includes 10 GB of data and 20 mins of international calls. You can obtain it in their shops with your international passport.</li></ul>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Area_Codes\">Area Codes</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><a href=\"/wiki/en/index.php?title=Azerbaijan&amp;action=edit&amp;section=41\" title=\"Edit section: Area Codes\">edit</a><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h3>\n<p>Agjabedi\t113,\t\nAgdam\t\t192,\t\nAgdash\t        193,\t\t\nAgsu\t\t198,\t\nAgstafa\t        244,\t\t\t\nAstara\t\t195,\nBabek\t\t136,\t\nBakou\t\t12,\nBalaken\t        119,\t\nBerde\t\t110,\nBeylagan\t152,\t\nBilesuvar\t159,\nDashkesen\t216,\nDevechi\t        115,\t\t\nFizuli\t\t141,\nGandja\t\t22,\nGedebey\t        232,\t\nGoranboy\t234,\nGoychay\t        167,\t\nHajigabul \t140,\nHoradiz\t        141,\t\n\u0130mishli\t\t154,\n\u0130smayilli\t178,\t\nJebrayil\t118,\t\nJelilabad\t114,\nJulfa\t\t36,\t\nKelbejer\t137,\nKurdemir\t145,\t\nLachin\t\t146,\nLenkeran\t171,\t\nLerik\t\t157,\nMasalli\t\t151,\t\nMereze\t\t150,\nMingechevir\t147,\t\nNabran\t\t156,\nNaftalan\t255,\t\nNakhchivan\t136,\nNeftchala\t153,\t\nOguz\t\t111,\nOrdubad\t        136,\t\nQakh\t\t144,\nQazakh\t        279,\t\nQazi Memmed\t140,\nQebele\t\t160,\t\nQobustan\t150,\nQuba\t\t169,\t\nQubadli\t        133,\nQusar\t\t138,\t\nSaatli\t\t168,\nSabirabad\t143,\t\nSalyan\t\t163,\nSamukh\t        265,\t\nSederek\t        136,\nShahbuz\t        136,\t\nShamakhi\t176,\nSheki\t\t177,\t\nShemkir\t        241,\nSherur\t\t136,\nShirvan\t        197,\nSiyezen\t        190,\nSumqayit\t18-64,\t\nShusha\t\t191,\nTerter\t\t246,\t\nTovuz\t\t231,\nUjar\t\t170,\t\nKhachmaz\t172,\nKhankendi\t162,\t\nKhanlar\t        230,\nKhizi\t\t199,\t\nKhojali\t\t102,\nKhudat\t\t172,\t\nYardimli\t175,\nYevlakh\t        166,\t\nZagatala\t174,\nZengilan\t196,\t\nZerdab\t\t135.\n</p><p><a href=\"//wikitravel.org/wiki/en/index.php?title=Category%3ACaucasus&amp;action=edit&amp;preload=Template:IsPartOf/preload\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\"><img alt=\"Create category\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/15px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png\" width=\"15\" height=\"15\" srcset=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/23px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png 1.5x, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg/30px-Categorisation-hierarchy-top2down.svg.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"300\" data-file-height=\"300\" /></a>\n</p>\n<table width=\"60%\" bgcolor=\"white\" align=\"center\" style=\"border-style:dotted;border-width:2px;border-color:lightblue\">\n<tr>\n<td><i>This <a href=\"/en/Wikitravel:What_is_an_article\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Wikitravel:What is an article\">article</a> is an <b><a href=\"/en/Wikitravel:Outline_articles\" title=\"Wikitravel:Outline articles\">outline</a></b> and needs more content.

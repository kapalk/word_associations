The Gulf of Aden lies to the east. The country can be divided into three regions; the coastal plain and volcanic plateaus in the central and southern parts of the country and the mountain ranges in the north. Much of the country is vast wasteland with virtually no arable land.\n\n==Understand==\nDjibouti's climate is very hot, humid and arid, especially in the summer. The summer heat is moderated, however, by a sustained breeze in the coastal city of Djibouti. From October to April, the temperature is cooler, with occasional rain. Cyclones from the Indian Ocean create heavy rains and flash flooding. \n\n==Cities==\n* [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]] - the capital and largest city\n* [[Ali Sabieh]]\n* [[Balho]]\n* [[Dikhil]]\n* [[Khor Angar]]\n* [[Obock]]\n* [[Tadjoura]]\n* [[Yoboki]]\n\n==Other destinations==\n\n*'''Lake Abhe''' on the Ethiopian border is a desolate, steaming lake surrounded by limestone chimneys and a lunar-esque landscape used as the \"Forbidden Zone\" in ''Planet of the Apes'' \n*'''Lake Assal''' is Africa's lowest point (157m below sea level) and the saltiest lake outside Antarctica. Its shores are largely salt pans and nearby is Ardoukoba, which last erupted in 1978.\n* [[Maskali Island]]\n* [[Moucha Island]]\n\n==Get in==\n\nAll visitors to Djibouti are required to have a visa. Depending on your nationality, there may be some differences on how long your visa is good for and if you need a visa prior to arrival or at arrival.\n\nThose travelling on EU and North American (USA/Canada) passports can get a visa on arrival for 10,000 DJF (3-day transit visa) or 15,000 DJF for a one-month tourist visa. The payment can be made in USD or Euro equivalent. You will need to show proof of return ticket as well as hotel reservation in Djibouti.  Ethiopian Airlines will not board you on a flight into Djibouti if you do not have a ticket onward from Djibouti, even if you have a visa.  The airline will sell you a ticket and tell you it is refundable, but it is not.\n\nIf you plan to enter by land you have to arrange for visas in advance. Visas can be obtained from neighbouring countries and where no Djibouti embassy exists, they can often be obtained from the French embassy. The types of visas include: Entry (''visa de s\u00e9jour''); Tourist (''visa de tourisme''); Business (''visa d\u2019affaires''); and Transit (''visa de transit''). \n\n===By plane===\n'''Djibouti-Ambouli International Airport''' (JIB) connects Djibouti with Dubai, [[United Arab Emirates]]. It also has flights to [[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], [[Puntland]], [[Somaliland]], [[Tanzania]], [[Egypt]], [[Madagascar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Oman]] and [[Yemen]]. Air France and Djibouti-based Daallo Airlines (D3) [http://www.daallo.com]) operates flights to Paris. Daallo also flies to Ethiopia, Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Somalia. The airport is 5km (3 miles) south of the city.\n\nAlso, please note that batteries are not allowed in carry-on luggage, they must be stored in checked luggage or you may face confiscation.\n\nWhen leaving the airport, take care not to be overcharged for a taxi. There is a large sign outside that states taxi fares -- you should not be paying more than 2,000 Djiboutian Francs for a ride to the Kempinski or Sheraton.\n\n===By car===\nThere are roads from Djibouti to Assab (Eritrea) and going west into Ethiopia via Dikhil. Travellers using them should be aware that road conditions are generally poor and personal security might be at risk when travelling \u2013 particularly to Ethiopia. Visitors are advised to check transit regulations as political conditions in Ethiopia and Eritrea are changeable. Currently, there are no problems with traveling to Eritrea and no formal border posts. Four-wheel-drive vehicles are recommended for the interior. There is a new highway from Djibouti to Tadjoura. Traffic drives on the right. It is advisable to carry water and petrol on any expedition off main routes. An International Driving Permit is recommended, although not legally required. A temporary licence to drive is available from local authorities on presentation of a valid British or Northern Ireland driving licence.\n\n===By bus===\nBuses operate from Djibouti to most towns and villages throughout the country. Buses leave when they are full. A minibus service operates in Djibouti, stopping on demand. A flat-fare system is used. \n\n===By boat===\nThere are ferry services connecting Djibouti to [[Yemen]]. Djibouti City is one of the main ports of eastern Africa so it's well trafficked.\n\n===By train===\n\nA new standard-gauge railway line links [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]] with Djibouti; passenger services were inaugurated in January 2017.\nDjibouti E-visa is not recognised by Ethiopian immigration staff at Furi-Lebu train station in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia as a valid travel document. Only a visa issued by a Djibouti embassy on passport is considered valid due to non-availability of computer at the Ethiopia-Djibouti border crossing.\n\n==Get around==\nTaxis are available in Djibouti and from the airport to the town, the price is fixed and displayed on a billboard on the exit towards the parking area; also in Ali-Sabieh, Dikhil, Dorale and Arta. Fares can increase by 50 percent after dark.\n\nSheraton Hotel offers free airport shuttle, but you need to order it in advance.\n\nBicycling is a great way to get around the small capital.\n\nFerry services sail daily from L'Escale (Djibouti) to [[Tadjoura]] and [[Obock]]. The journey takes about three hours.\n\n==Talk==\n\nAlthough the official languages are '''[[French phrasebook|French]]''' and '''[[Arabic phrasebook|Arabic]]''', the most common native languages of the local population are [[Somali phrasebook|Somali]] and [[Afar phrasebook|Afar]]. Omani Arabic, [[Amharic phrasebook|Amharic]], [[Greek phrasebook|Greek]] and [[Hindi phrasebook|Hindi]] are also spoken by smaller numbers.\n\nEnglish may be spoken at tourist facilities, but is not widely spoken by locals or taxi drivers.\n\n==See==\n*<see name=\"Lac Assal\" alt=\"\" address=\"\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\">150m below sea level, Lake Assal is the second-lowest point on Earth. You'll need to hire a car or ask someone who lives in Djibouti to drive you there. Expect a rough ride: the roads outside the capital are destroyed by the truck traffic between Djibouti and Ethiopia. The road passes within sight of the Devil's Island, and some impressive views. Expect to be awestruck.</see>\n\n==Do==\n* '''Scuba Diving'''&mdash;despite the country's arid landscape, underwater off the coast lie several reefs teaming with all sorts of life.\n*<do name=\"\" alt=\"\" address=\"\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\">'''Kayak''' - The Gulf of Tadjoura has some of the most pristine waters in the world.  You can paddle for hours to untouched reefs for snorkeling and isolated beaches.  </do>\n\n==Buy==\n\n''Khat'':  A leafy stimulant popular with the locals. The herb is flown into the country each morning from Ethiopia and arrives by truck in Djibouti's Central Market at about 1PM. It is fairly inexpensive, but quality varies greatly, so shop with caution.\n \nPROVISO: If you are prone to indulge, discern whether this is a good idea, as you are in a foreign country and may be placed under suspicion as a foreign visitor for partaking in acts illegal in your country of origin. Take care! In addition, Khat may not be taken out of Djibouti through the airport and use and possession by foreigners is not encouraged - you may be subject to police involvement, as it is considered a controlled substance in some other countries, or illegal.\n\n===Costs===\nConversion between DJF and USD is fairly stable as the DJF is tied to the dollar. You can convert dollars to francs with local street money changers located in the Djiboutian market area for 175 DJF to $1 USD. The street money changers are ladies who line the street waiting to convert USD to DJF. They are generally honest brokers. Have your calculator ready and make sure to ask in advance what the conversion rate is, if they quote you anything less than 175 go to another broker. Most all of them speak a little English.\n\nYou can purchase general merchandise and food items at the larger department stores using USD and they will use the 175 conversion rate. The tourist traps will obviously see you coming a mile away and hit you with ridiculous conversion rates as well as their tourist prices. If you have access to Camp Lemonnier, go to the disbursement office for the best rate at 177.\n\nThese rates have not changed since July 2009.\n\n==Eat==\n*<eat name=\"Melting Pot\" alt=\"Restaurant Djibouti\" address=\"Heron\" directions=\"heron, Bernard street\" phone=\"253 21350399\" hours=\"11am-11pm\" price=\"4$-30$\" lat=\"\" long=\"\">Restaurant Melting Pot Djibouti, is located in Heron.

If you are interested in western cuisine, be prepared for sticker shock. If you are interested in good local cuisine, then you and your pocket book will be happier for the experience. For example, the Ethiopian Community Center offers a wide variety of  dishes with a local flair which are very tasty, safe to eat, and reasonably priced. Best to avoid places that the tourists hang out at, and you will be happier for the experience. Average price per meal outside of a tourist trap: $4 including drink.\n\n==Sleep==\n<sleep name=\"Djibouti Palace Kempinski\" address=\"Ilot Du Heron, P.O.

Shared bathroom with western-style toilet.\n\n==Learn==\n\n==Work==\n\n==Stay safe==\nNatural hazards include earthquakes and droughts. Occasional cyclonic disturbances from the Indian Ocean bring heavy rains and flash floods.\n\nVisitors should be aware of the risk of banditry if traveling outside the capital city.\n\nAlso terrorism is a threat.\n\n==Stay healthy==\nHealth insurance is advisable. Doctors and hospitals may expect immediate cash payment for any medical treatment. A yellow fever vaccination certificate is required from travelers over one year of age coming from infected areas. Cholera is also a serious risk and precautions are essential. Up-to-date advice should be sought before deciding if these precautions should include vaccination as medical opinion is divided over its effectiveness. Typhoid immunization is usually advised.\n\nTRAVELLERS HEALTH ADVISORY: Malaria risk exists via mosquitos, predominantly in the malignant falciparum form year round (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmodium_falciparum). \nStrains resistant to chloroquine have been reported here. \nMefloquine, doxycycline or atovaquone/proguanil are recommended.\nThe adult '''HIV/AIDS''' prevalence rate is currently at '''.91%'''.\n\n==Respect==\nCasual wear is widely acceptable, but visitors are reminded that Djibouti is a Muslim country and certain codes of behavior should be observed. Shorts are generally not appropriate outside of hotels, beaches, or sport activities.\n\n==Contact==\nThe 13th French Foreign Legion Demi-Brigadeis (13\u00e8me DBLE)(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/13th_Demi-Brigade_of_the_Foreign_Legion), was permanently stationed in Djibouti, and consisted of about 800 men. They redeployed to the United Arab Emirates on June 13th, 2011 [http://www.defense.gouv.fr/terre/actu-terre/la-13e-dble-quitte-djibouti/ 13\u00e8me Leaves Djibouti].\n\nThere is also a 2,000 person plus U.S. military presence in Djibouti, located at Camp Lemonnier (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Lemonnier) across the runway from the international airport.\n\n{{Countryguide}}\n{{outline}}\n\n[[ca:Djibouti]]\n[[de:Dschibuti]]\n[[eo:\u011cibutio]]\n[[es:Yibuti]]\n[[fi:Djibouti]]\n[[fr:Djibouti]]\n[[hu:Dzsibuti]]\n[[it:Gibuti]]\n[[ja:\u30b8\u30d6\u30c1]]\n[[nl:Djibouti (land)]]\n[[pl:D\u017cibuti]]\n[[pt:Djibuti]]\n[[ru:\u0414\u0436\u0438\u0431\u0443\u0442\u0438]]\n[[sv:Djibouti]]\n[[wts:Category:Djibouti]]\n\n[[WikiPedia:Djibouti]]\n[[Dmoz:Africa/Djibouti/]]\n[[World66:africa/djibouti]]\n{{isPartOf|East Africa}}"

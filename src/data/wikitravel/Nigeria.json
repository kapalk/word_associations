It is the continent's most populous nation. It has a southern coastline on the Gulf of Guinea, and has [[Benin]] to the west, [[Cameroon]] to the southeast, [[Chad]] to the northeast, and [[Niger]] to the north. \n\nNigeria is the most populous country in Africa and the seventh most populous country in the world. It is the largest African oil producer and, since April 2014, the largest economy in Africa.\n\n==Understand==\nOne of the official languages in Nigeria is English. However, while this may sound reassuring, only upper and middle-class people in the cities actually speak it outside of formal environment, though most citizens have a good understanding of English. The national ''lingua franca'' is Nigerian pidgin, an English-based creole language spoken by 75 million people as a second language and by 3-5 million people as a native language, mostly in the Niger Delta. Nigerian pidgin is highly intelligible to an English-speaker to a certain degree, but it will take time to get accustomed to it. However, Nigerian pidgin will not hinder day to day communications. The easiest way to overcome any initial language block is to ask questions. They will not hesitate to ask you to clarify what you mean, or admit that they do not understand an outsider's particular manner of phrasing or accent. Do not assume that a Nigerian's inability to answer you indicates ignorance.\n  \n===History===\n\n====The pre-colonial era====\nIn the northern part of the country, Kano and Katsina have a recorded history which dates back to around 999&nbsp;CE. \n\nIn southeastern Nigeria the Kingdom of Nri of the Igbo people flourished from 10th century until 1911 and the city of Nri is considered to be the foundation of Igbo culture.\n\nThe kingdoms of If\u1eb9 and Oyo in the western block of Nigeria became prominent about 700\u2013900 and 1400 respectively. The Yoruba mythology believes that Ile-Ife is the source of the human race and that it predates any other civilization. Another prominent kingdom in south western Nigeria was the Kingdom of Benin whose power lasted between the 15th and 19th century. Their dominance reached as far as the well known city of Eko, later named Lagos by the Portuguese.\n\nIn addition, Tiv culture in the North central region of Nigeria dates to 6 B.C.. Some of the famous bronze terracotta sculpture heads from this culture have been shown around the world.\n\n====Colonial era====\nPortuguese explorers were the first Europeans to begin trade in Nigeria, and called the main port Lagos after the Portuguese town of Lagos, in Algarve. This name stuck on with more European trade with the region. The Europeans traded with the ethnicities of the coast and also established a trade in slaves which affected many Nigerian ethnicities. Following the Napoleonic Wars, the British expanded trade with the Nigerian interior.\n\nIn 1885 British claims to a West African sphere of influence received international recognition and in the following year the Royal Niger Company was chartered. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On January 1, 1901 Nigeria became a British protectorate (northern and southern protectorates) and part of the British Empire. In 1914 the northern protecorate and the southern protectorate under the colonial rule were merged forming one single entity named \"Nigeria\" (meaning: Niger[river niger] area. The name \"nigeria\" was given by the wife of the British Governor-General in charge of the country - Sir Lord Lugard.\n \nFollowing World War II, in response to the growth of Nigerian nationalism and demands for independence, successive constitutions legislated by the British Government moved Nigeria toward self-government on a representative and increasingly federal basis. By the middle of the 20th century, the great wave for independence was sweeping across Africa.\n\n====Post-independence====\nOn 1 October 1960, Nigeria gained its independence from the United Kingdom. Nigeria, like many African countries, was formed to benefit its colonial power - the United Kingdom. Colonies served two role. They are first and foremost, a source of raw materials for the factories in Europe. Their second function is to serve as markets for the finished products from the European factories.\n\nThe colonies were formed to operate chaotically. Hitherto distinct and autonomous ethnicities, who had often been at war with each other were merged into same colonies. The British doctrine of Divide-and-Rule ensured that these rivalries continued throughout the colonial occupation.\n\nNigeria became independent in 1960 with a sharply divided people. The Eastern Region was largely Christian and populated by the Igbo people. The North was predominantly Muslim and populated by the Hausa and a host of smaller tribes. The Western Region was home to the Yoruba, who were largely  Christians with a mix of Islam, and animism. \n\nThe Parliamentary model of government was introduced and the Northern party - the Northern Peoples Congress (NPC) formed government at independence on October 1st 1960. There was never a truly developed sense of singular Nigerian identity prior to independence.\n\nThe country's first Prime Minster, Alhaji, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, was from the North. His party was led by Sir, Ahmadu Bello, the Sardauna of Sokoto. Ahmadu Bello delegated his deputy to become the Prime Minister while he stayed at Kaduna as the Premier of Northern Nigeria.\n\nThe first coup was executed on 15th January 1966, when some Nigerian soldiers led by Major Kaduna Nzeogwu assassinated the Prime Minister, Alhaji, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and 12 other senior politicians and soldiers.\n\nThe cities of Kaduna, Ibadan, and Lagos were attacked and the Niger and Benue Rivers were blockaded. The coup was suppressed within two days. \n\nA senior Army officer, General Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi then used the coup as a pretext to annex power, ending Nigeria's nascent democracy. It was one of the events that led to the Nigerian Civil War.\n\nBy July 28th of the same year, a second military coup led by Northern officers was executed. This coup is seen as a reprisal to the earlier one in January. The Head of State, General Ironsi, and a host of senior military leaders from the Southeast were killed. While the January coup is seen largely as an Igbo coup against the Hausa leaders, the July coup was a reprisal by Northern (largely Hausa) soldiers against Igbo rulers.\n\nThe July mutiny/counter coup resulted in the murder of Nigeria's 1st military Head of State General Aguiyi Ironsi and Lt Colonel Adekunle Fajuyi (who was hosting a visiting Ironsi) in Ibadan by angry northern Non Commissioned Officers (NCOs).  Upon the termination of Ironsi's government, Lt Colonel Yakubu Gowon was appointed Head of State by the July 1966 coup conspirators.\n\nThe Governor of the Eastern Region, Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu insisted the most senior military officer at the time, Brigadier B.A.O. Ogundipe be appointed as Head of State. He also protested against the killing of his people in the north.\nBy May 1967, the Eastern Region had declared itself an independent state called the Republic of Biafra due to much killing of it's people in the Northern Region and the 30 month Nigerian Civil War began. More than one million people died, many of them starving to death in eastern Nigeria.\n\nDuring the oil boom of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and billions of dollars generated by production in the oil-rich Niger Delta flowed into the coffers of the Nigerian state. However, increasing corruption and graft at all levels of government squandered most of these earnings. Obasanjo began to take power in 1999 and again in 2003 were condemned as unfree and unfair, Nigeria has shown marked improvements in attempts to tackle government corruption and to hasten development. Ethnic violence over the oil producing Niger Delta region and inadequate infrastructures are some of the current issues in the country.\n\n===Climate===\nVaries; equatorial in the south, tropical in the centre, arid in the north. Natural hazards include periodic droughts and flooding. Tornadoes and hurricanes are rare because they typically are weak at this stage and travel west of the Atlantic.\n\n===Terrain===\nSouthern lowlands merge into central hills and plateaus; mountains in the southeast, plains in the north. The Niger river enters the country in the northwest and flows southward through tropical rain forests and swamps to its delta in the Gulf of Guinea. The highest point is Chappal Waddi at 2,419m.\n\n==Regions==\n[[Image:Nigeria Regions map.png|thumb|upright=2.2|Map of Nigeria with regions colour-coded]]\n\n{{Regionlist\n\n| region1name=[[Southwest Nigeria]] \n| region1color=#70993c\n| region1items=\n| region1description=land of the Yoruba and Edo as well as minorities, the major city of [[Lagos]]\n\n| region2name=[[Southeast Nigeria]]\n| region2color=#8cb3ad\n| region2items=\n| region2description=land of the Igbo people, the Ibibio and Ijaw, as well as minorities and centre of the huge oil industry\n\n| region3name=[[Central Nigeria]] \n| region3color=#67be73\n| region3items=\n| region3description=transitional zone between the southern forests and northern savanna\n\n| region4name=[[Eastern Nigeria]] \n| region4color=#7CD1A0\n| region4items= \n| region4description=a rural region with several nature reserves and highlands along the border with [[Cameroon]]\n\n| region5name=[[Northern Nigeria]] \n| region5color=#bcd7a8\n| region5items=\n| region5description=land of the Hausa and Fulani\n| region6name=[[Northeastern Nigeria]] \n| region6color=#608860\n| region6items=\n| region6description=dominated by the Kanuri people\n}}\n\n==Cities== \n* [[Abuja]] &mdash; Capital.

This can be obtained at Nigerian embassies, high commissions and consulates worldwide.\n\nIf you require a visa to enter Nigeria, you might be able to apply for one at a British embassy, high commission or consulate in the country where you legally reside if there is no Nigerian diplomatic post. For example, the British embassies in[http://w ww.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/countries/kosovo/commonwealth-bots/?langname=null Pristina] and [http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/countries/bulgaria/commonwealth-bots/?langname=null Sofia] accept Nigerian visa applications (this list is '''not''' exhaustive). British diplomatic posts charge GBP50 to process a Nigerian visa application and an extra GBP70 if the authorities in Nigeria require the visa application to be referred to them. The authorities in Nigeria can also decide to charge an additional fee if they correspond with you directly.\n\nBe aware that you are not usually able to apply at a Nigerian diplomatic post in a country where you are not a legal resident. Also, an in-person interview may be a formal requirement, which can make applications from a distance challenging. \n\n'''A heed of warning''' for recent visitors and those wishing to visit Nigeria. Due to the current ebola virus outbreak, the countries of [[Belize]], [[Botswana]], [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Guyana]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Mongolia]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], [[Sao Tome and Principe]] and [[South Africa]]. \n\nBe sure to take your yellow fever vaccination form with you. Despite yellow fever vaccination not being a visa requirement, you may still be denied entry if you cannot present the vaccination form as proof. Even if you have not recently visited a yellow fever zone, and even though the yellow fever vaccine is not an entry requirement, you will very likely be asked to present proof of vaccination, and held until you bribe immigration officials if you cannot produce it.\n\nNationals of Kenya can obtain a visa upon arrival for a maximum stay of 90 days.\n\n===By plane===\n*International airports are located in Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt and Enugu. The Lagos domestic and international terminals are located several miles apart. Transfers between the two terminals are time consuming. Lagos is a bustling airport which can be intimidating for first-time visitors to Nigeria. Port Harcourt is equally difficult--perhaps more--and is frequently ranked as the worst airport in the world.\n\n* Arik Air, Bellview Airlines, and Aero Contractors make local and regional flights (to other West African countries). Arik Air provides international service to London (UK), New York (USA), Luanda (Angola), and Johannesburg (South Africa). Virgin Nigeria/Air Nigeria has ceased all operations.\n\n* Several European airlines fly to Nigeria: British Airways (London Heathrow - Abuja, Lagos), Virgin Atlantic (London Heathrow - Lagos), KLM ([[Amsterdam]] - Abuja, Lagos, Kano), Air France ([[Paris]]-Charles de Gaulle - Lagos), Alitalia ([[Rome]]- Fiumicino - Accra, Lagos), Turkish Airline ([[Istanbul]] - Lagos), Lufthansa ([[Frankfurt]] - Abuja, Lagos), Iberia Airlines ([[Madrid]] - Lagos), Ethiopian Airlines (Addis Ababa - Lagos, Enugu)\n\n* US Based Delta Airlines operates 5 times a week a non-stop service from Atlanta to Lagos using a Boeing 777-200 aircraft since 1 July 2009. More recently Delta Airlines has replaced the Boeing 777 with a 767. Delta Airlines no longer services Abuja. \n\n* United Airlines (which bought Continental) flies at least 5x per week nonstop from Houston to Lagos using either the Boeing 777 or 787.\n\n*Other inter-continental airlines fly to Lagos. They include: China Southern Airlines ([[Beijing]], [[Dubai]]), Emirates (Dubai), Middle East Airlines ([[Beirut]]), Qatar Airways ([[Doha]]), Etihad Airways (Abu Dhabi).\n\n*There are African companies: South African Airlines from Johannesburg, Egypt Air from [[Cairo]], Ethiopian Airlines from [[Addis Ababa]], Kenya Airways from [[Nairobi]], Afriqya Airways from [[Tripoli]], Hewa Bora from [[Kinshasa]].\n\n*Besides these, there are other airlines (in addition to VNA and Bellview) that operate domestic and regional flights to places like [[Abidjan]], [[Accra]], [[Banjul]], [[Conakry]], [[Dakar]], [[Douala]], [[Freetown]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Libreville]], [[Monrovia]]. \n\n*Currently, The Port Harcourt International Airport is fully operational again after being closed for about 2 years for rehabilitation works.\n\n*There are also airports in most states of the federation and local air travel is widespread.\n\n===By train===\n*Most of the trains in Nigeria are for transporting cargo.\n*The former president, Yar'adua, however, said that he planned to invest and aggressively pursue a nationwide train network, of which his successor former president Jonathon did although not yet to international standard.\n* At the moment it is not advisable to travel on train especially if you are a foreign national.\n\n===By bus===\nGetting around is relatively easy, except that there could be delays due to traffic jams within most major cities. There are multitudes of coaches and buses that will take you to any part of Nigeria you wish (ABC Transport Services is well known for its services among others). Lagos state government also operates a transit system (BRT buses) which serves the Lagos metropolis. CHISCO is another well-known bus company in Nigeria. Both CHISCO and ABC Transport provide regular, reliable international service between Lagos (Nigeria) and Accra (Ghana).\n\n===By boat===\nTransport by boat isn't widespread unless you venture into the riverine areas of Nigeria.\n\n==Get around==\nIt would be best to travel around in your own car or a hired one (with a driver) but there are various other modes of transport. The road systems in Nigeria are relatively poor compared with North American and European countries, but often still passable.  The \"okada\" (motorcycle) is not for the faint-hearted (there used to be no helmets but as a law the rider is required to have two helmets for himself and a passenger) and should only be used for short distance journeys. \"Okadas\" will get you to where you want to go quickly and you will get there in one piece. In Lagos, there are lots of buses and taxis. There are two main types of buses, the molue and the danfo. Most smaller cities have more taxis than buses, and they are quite affordable. \n\nFor travelling from one city to another, you go to the \"motor park\", find the taxi that's going to your destination, and wait until it \"fills up\". The price is fixed, you don't have to negotiate. Some drivers may have a risky driving style however - practically this means that the only rule consistently adhered to (by cars, not necessarily motorcycles), is keeping on the right.\n\n===By car===\nDriving in Nigeria (especially Lagos) is somewhat unique, vaguely resembling driving in Cairo.  If mastered, you should however be able to cope in most other countries on the planet. Or any other planet. Roads are bad. Expect potholes of every size. Expect people to drive on the wrong side to avoid potholes or just bad patches of road. Even on the highway. Expect the road to be gone. Expect everything. Grass or branches on the road means there is a broken down vehicule ahead of you, be careful.\n\nDriving in Abuja, however, is relatively easier because the roads are mostly good, but since the population is lower compared to Lagos, you should adopt defensive driving especially on weekends where drunk and rich speedsters feel that there's no one on the road.\n\nIf you are white, get used to Nigerians shouting at you as you pass by. It will be something like \"Oyinbo\", \"MBakara\", \"Bature\" or \"white man\" if you're white. It all means the same, they are just telling you. \n\nSelf-driving for short-term visitors unfamiliar with the roads, especially in Lagos, is by no means advisable and could actually be quite foolish if not dangerous. With crime on the rise, you could easily wander into an area or a road bl* <do name=\"\" alt=\"\" address=\"\" directions=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" phone=\"\" tollfree=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\"></do>ock set by local gangs.  If you choose to rent a car, it will come with a driver familiar with the area and style of driving, which is a much easier and safer option.\n\nIf you as a foreigner wish to drive yourself, it is advisable to stick to the rules, as you will be an easy target for poorly paid police officers looking for somebody to \"fine\" (payable directly to the officer in cash without a ticket or receipt) for the most petty reasons like not indicating your intention of wanting to drive straight. Should you be pulled over, do not give them your licence, as you will then lose all bargaining power when negotiating the fine, which could easily be a maximum of all the visible cash you have on you at the time. Rather carry a copy of the licence and hand that over, or show your licence through your window. Also do not let the police get into your car. They are not really dangerous, but it could get expensive and certainly annoying.\n\nHowever, if you just don't pay and never get angry, it only costs time. They have no real power over you.\n\nEspecially over weekends and festive times, it is common practice for police, especially in the richer areas of Lagos, to flag you down and wish you happy weekend/holiday/Christmas/Easter/sunny weather/trip to work. In this case, you did nothing wrong and they do not intend to \"fine\" you, but are rather begging for some small money for them. If you insistently yet politely refuse to give something, they will eventually let you go. Just wish them a nice weekend/holiday/etc. too.\n\nIf you work for a big company in Nigeria, you will usually have a company driver to drive you around, thereby avoiding the above mentioned problems to a large extent. He can arrange a local driving licence for you should the need arise without a driving test or proof of foreign licence.\n\nNigeria is not part of the most standard international Road Traffic Convention and as such will require a special International Driving Permit (valid only for driving in Nigeria, Somalia and Iraq) (if you do not want to get the Nigerian license), not the normal one applicable to almost all other countries in the world.\n\nLots of  street sellers surround the car when you get to crossroads in crowded areas. You should not have a problem if you keep the windows and doors locked however. \n\nThe last Saturday of the month is Sanitation Day in Lagos, when the locals clean their premises. While it is not illegal to be out on the street 07:00-10:00, due to the higher than usual presence of police officers and road checkpoints, most Nigerians choose to restrict their movements until after 10:00.  Should you be caught at this time, you may be taken away by the police to perform some \"public sanitation\" duty, like mowing lawns, etc.\n\n===By plane===\nArik, Virgin Nigeria and Aero Contractors have good scheduled domestic connections with modern aircraft to most significant destinations at reasonable prices. Their websites are very user friendly and well updated.\n\nNote that in Lagos, the two domestic terminals, while next to each other, are about 4-5km (of road which would not be wise to walk if you don't know the place) from the international terminal, and you would therefore need a taxi to get from the one to the other, should you wish to transfer from an international flight to a domestic one.\n\n==See==\n*Lagos: Bar Beach, Badagary Beach, Tarkwa bay Beach\n*Lekki (suburb of Lagos): Lekki Forest Reserve - nice little fenced-off and interesting patch of tropical rainforest with wooden walkways located on the outskirts of the city (ask a taxi to take you to \"across from Chevron Oil Company (who financed much of the refurbishment of the forest to look greener) on the Lekki Express Way, just before the second toll gate\", as locals tend not to know about the existence of the place, so taxi will probably look at you with a \"huh\" expression even though he may drive past it daily), Lekki Beach, Eleko Beach\n*Jos: [http://www.ecotourhills.com Hiking and tourism on the Plateau]\n*Enugu:Hiking and traditional events e.g New yam and atiliogwu dancers\n*Calabar: Harbour and slave monuments in Calabar and Tinapa (the Nollywood studios) a little drive outside the city.\n*Obudu: Small town a few hours to the north from Calabar very close to the Cameroon border - rent a car from Calabar airport (comes with driver) and ask the driver to take you there via Tinapa.  This is a cool mountain escape with a nice resort (Obudu Mountain Resort) on the mountain (the president also has a week-end home there).  They have some forest walks, hiking, one of the longest cable cars in the world (Austrian built) and very nice pristine swimming pools with fountains available.\n\n==Talk==\n\nThere are over 500 languages spoken in Nigeria. The official language of Nigeria is '''English''', with [[Hausa phrasebook|Hausa]], [[Igbo phrasebook|Igbo]], [[Yoruba phrasebook|Yoruba]] being the three most commonly spoken African languages. Other major languages spoken include [[Fulani phrasebook|Fulani]], [[Efik phrasebook|Efik]], [[Ejagham phrasebook|Ejagham]], [[Urhobo phrasebook|Urhobo]] and Edo.\n\nThe ''lingua franca'' of Nigeria is '''Nigerian Pidgin''' - an English-based creole language. Pidgin is most widely spoken in the Niger Delta, where most of its population speak it as their first language. The language shares a lot of similarities with English-based creoles found in the Caribbean, particularly Jamaican Patois.\n\n==Buy==\nIt is advisable that you know where to buy things in advance of your going out. This can save you unnecessary exposure to touts. [http://www.NigerianYellowPages.com Nigerian Yellow Pages] provides list of businesses, contact addresses and phone numbers and for shops and restaurants, your hotel can give you advise as well. When meeting businesses, the best thing to do is to locate the business, call their representative, who can give you detailed information on how to locate them.\n\n===Important information on currency and credit cards===\nNigeria's currency is the ''Naira'' ('''NGN'''). Around June 2017 the rate was about USD1 = NGN315. \n\n* <buy name=\"TradeNAIRA\" alt=\"\" address=\"16 Ingestre Place, London W1F 0JJ\" directions=\"tube: Piccadilly Circus\" phone=\"+44 203 318 0855\" url=\"http://tradenaira.com/\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" email=\"SUPPORT@tradenaira.com\" fax=\"\">TradeNAIRA  are the leading Nigerian Naira currency specialists dealing with the Naira and other West African currencies they are also a great place to get the latest [https://tradenaira.com/ Nigerian Naira Exchange Rates]</buy>\n\nGenerally, foreign credit cards are not accepted in many of the stores or even hotels in Nigeria. If you hold a Visa, MasterCard or Maestro Credit/Debit card you can withdraw cash in Naira from various ATMs in most Nigerian cities including Lagos. Visa machines can be found at Standard Chartered Bank. MasterCard/Maestro machines are found in Ecobank and some Zenith Bank branches however, most ATM machines accept both Visa and MasterCars/Maestro and are usually located within the premises of most [http://buzznigeria.com/nigerian-banks/ big Nigerian commercial banks] including their branches and outlets. Be aware that these machines only allow you to withdraw 20,000 Naira at a time, which is a relatively small amount in Nigeria. This means you will have to make multiple withdrawals at a time, and for each of those transactions you might have to pay a hefty Cash Advance Fee depending upon your bank policies. Also, most ATM's allow a maximum withdrawal of 100,000 Naira per day. Use Diamond Bank, who gives you NGN40,000 per withdrawal.\n\nThe best thing to do would be to buy Naira using foreign currency at the airports or near large hotels. Even here, only US dollars, pounds sterling, and euros are normally traded by these stores, or at least traded at a reasonable exchange rate. So change your home currency to one of these three even before you land in Nigeria. Changing large bills of US dollars or euros will give a better rate with professional money changers, such as on the currency exchange market near Lagos Domestic Airport. This is a walled enclosure with a large number of money changers, which is primarily used by local nationals. \n\nRemember that these are not formal bureaux de change and you will need to negotiate the exchange rate. It is strongly recommended that you count your money in front of the exchanger, and don't be afraid to walk away if you are not happy with the deal. Be wary of your safety in money changing areas, and take care to make sure you are not followed when leaving them. There are formal Bureau De Change existing in the various banks, and you can be rest assured about transacting with them, although their rates may be slightly higher or lower than the rates outside.\n\nIt is advised to cash all your naira back into another currency at the airport before you leave Nigeria.  The rate is irrelevant, as the naira is not worth that much outside Nigeria. In fact, you might not find any exchange office anywhere outside of Nigeria that trades Naira making them worthless pieces of paper once you come out of the country. Naira bills/coins may be of interest to currency collectors, but other than that, they will be nothing more than colorful souvenirs of your trip. Banks will change foreign currency to Naira, BUT USUALLY NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND, EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE A FOREIGNER.  You would therefore need to use the Bureaus de Change at the International terminal or the new Domestic terminal or street vendors to get foreign currency should you end up with unused Nairas at the end of your trip.  A safe place to change in Victoria Island is in the tourist market of Eco Hotel in Victoria Island (not the hotel reception which will give you rip-off rates).   \n\nIf the Bureaus de Change at the airport do not want to help or are closed, the car park outside the International terminal is full of street vendors only to willing to change money from/into any major currency.  When dealing with these street vendors, keep the money you are dealing with fully visible till the deal is finished (i.e. don't put into handbag and later discover it is wrong and then try and bargain) and count carefully with them, as they tend to try and short-change you with a note or two, especially when you change foreign currency into Naira (which is a thick bundle of small notes), but with necessary vigilance are generally fine.  Street vendors are also plentiful at the main land borders to change Naira into CFAs (XOF (Benin and Niger side) or XAF (Cameroon side)) if need be.  XOF and XAF are freely and easily convertible to and from Euros at a rate of 655.957 (sometimes with a small commission) when you are in the French countries.\n\nOn Abuja and Lagos International Airport money can be withdrawn from ATM machine's. On Lagos International there are several ATM's, several may not function at all times. On Lagos Domestic Terminal there is also a functioning ATM in the domestic terminal on the 1th floor. Usually this a quiet ATM which also is very private and secure.\n\nMasterCard / Maestro users can also withdraw Money from ATMs at several branches of Zenith Bank and GT Bank. Some ATM machines of Ecobank, First Bank and Intercontinental Bank also allow for MasterCard / Maestro cards. Look for the red ATM sign outside, or ask the on-site security officer at any branch. Also look for Ecobank, they have a branch within the premises of the Murtala Muhammed International Airport.  Visa is however a safer option if you are visiting the French countries around Nigeria as well, as Mastercard/Maestro is close to useless in these countries.\n\n===Bargaining===\nAt markets, you are supposed to haggle for your goods (a notable exception is bread: its price is fixed). As a general rule, the real price is about half the price that was first asked. The seller may exaggerate the price when he or she thinks that you are a rich tourist ignorant of the real price. After agreeing on a price, don't walk away without buying, this is considered very rude. It is also advisable to go to the market with a friend you trust (preferably Nigerian). That way the seller will know you can't be tricked into paying a higher price than normal.\n\nShops like supermarkets and restaurants will typically charge fixed prices. Fresh products and Western-style sit-in restaurants aren`t quite expensive, with it not being uncommon to pay USD7.5 for a dinner per person.\n\n==Eat==\nThere are many types of traditional cuisine to enjoy. For example: afang soup, okra soup, owo soup and starch in the Niger Delta, plantain (fried, boiled, roasted), pepper soup, amala, eba, efo, pounded yam (iyan - Yoruba for \"pounded yam\" pronounce \" ee-yon (o as in mom)\" , jollof rice, ground nut soup, ogbono soup, isi ewu (goat's head stew), egusi soup, suya (meat on a kebab rolled in spiced and cooked over a fire grill), moin moin, ewedu, gbegiri soup (beans soup), edikangikong, ground-rice, puff-puff (fried doughnut), chin chin, ikokore, owerri soup (ofe owerri), which is the most expensive African soup in Nigeria. Not to forget 404 pepper soup - it will make you act like \"Oliver Twist.\" You must realise that 404 means \"dog meat.\" and yes, it can only be found in certain parts of the country because in the west it is seen a barbaric. All the foods above vary greatly in their taste, spice and flavour. Be warned, it is not uncommon to have a lot of pepper in soups (Nigerian pepper can be very hot and spicy, probably more spicy than Spanish chillies).\n\nFor the less adventurous traveller, there are loads of \"foreign\" restaurants in Lagos, e.g. Sky Bar and the grill at Eco Hotel, Churasco's, Lagoon and Fusion all three next to each other (all-you-can-eat Brazilian grill, Indian and Sushi respectively) with a nice view of the lagoon, Piccolo Mondo, Manuella's Residence (great Italian Pizza from Manuella the Italian lady), Bungalo (close to Coschari's BMW in VI) - good sports bar, grill and Sushi, great Sunday buffet at Radisson Blu.  Chocolate Royal is a nice family restaurant with excellent ice cream selection (including ice cream cakes) and pastries in VI.  Inside Chocolate Royal is an Oriental restaurant called M\u00e9tisse.  Bottles in VI is a grill and Mexican restaurant.  And there are loads more flavours from every corner of the world.  Just Google and ask taxi to take you there.  Outside Lagos and to a lesser extent Abuja, Western food will tend to disappear, with \"Jollof Rice and friend chicken\" being a \"safe\" option if you are not adventurous.\n\nForeign restaurants are very cheap and you can prepare for a bill of at least USD5.00 to USD7.50 or even USD10 per head for main course, ice cream and one drink per person.  If this is too much, try the Syrian Club in Ikoyi (turn North - away from the water) at the Mobil filling station in Awolowo Road (the night club street) in Ikoyi, continue a few blocks and on your left you will see the Syrian mosque, turn in the gate just after the mosque and the Syrian Club will be on your right on the inside of the premises with nice Lebanese/Syrian flair at very affordable (for Lagos) prices in an outdoor setting.\n\nIf you are a new expat living in Lagos, do yourself a favour and acquaint yourself early on with the following more expensive, foreign owned, but well worth-it, smaller specialist shops in VI selling all the delicacies and nice imported red meats that foreigners long for in and that Shoprite, Park and Shop and Goodie's (the main supermarkets) may not stock:  1. Deli's on Akin Adesola (the main road leading to Bar Beach), 2. L'Epic\u00e9rie across the road from Mega Plaza and 3. La Pointe on Kofo Abayomi Street (close to the Brazilian Embassy/Consulate) and not easy to spot.  Knowing these places will significantly improve your coping ability in the first couple of months.\n\n==Drink==\n*Nigeria is one of the places where Guinness is brewed outside of Ireland. And they do it pretty well, although it's not the same product. The Guinness brand (with logo and copyrights where they should be) is also used to brew both an alcohol-free malt version of the black stuff, and an extra strong (about 7.5%) version of Guinness in Kenya (in the case of the latter) and Tanzania (in the case of the former). \n\n*Beer is actually big business in Nigeria, although the move toward evangelism and Islamic law is making its mark. Lagos is relatively unaffected due to its cosmopolitan nature. Heineken, Star, Harp, Gulder and other international beers are available.\n\n*Malt beverages (non alcoholic) are very common in Nigeria. \n\n*The other cheap drink of choice is gin, which is locally made. Some locals will swear to it making their step uncle's dog blind, though, so be careful.\n\n*Never drink the water sold in plastic bags, except they have a NAFDAC registration number on them. It probably hasn't been boiled, and may carry some nasty diseases. The bottled water and other soft drinks are safe.\n\nOther drinks to consider include: palm wine, wine, zobo (red soft drink, is a tea of dried roselle flowers), kunun, kai kai (also called ogogoro).\n\nThe northern states have implemented Sharia (Islamic) law, which means that alcohol is prohibited. Ironically, the only places where you can drink a beer in these states are the police staff bars and the army barracks, because these are institutions under federal law. Beer is available in Kano, in restaurants managed by foreign or Christian people, Chinese restaurants, and/or French cafes.\n\nFor a real night out, go to the Sabongari area of the old town. Plenty of bars around that stay open till very late. Many do decent food as well. Sabongari is also the place to buy alcoholic drinks and there are plenty stores open late into the night. Some hotels in Kano are \"dry\", however in Tahir Guest Palace the staff will be quite happy to buy you a few bottles of beer for you in your room (all rooms have large fridges).\n\n==Sleep==\n'''Important notice.'''\n''Almost all hotels in Nigeria require you to pay before you get your key. This applies even to the Sheraton and the Hilton. Typically you are requested to pay 125% of the room rate and you will be refunded when settling the bill at your departure. If you stay more than one night you need to keep the credit up. However, paying this deposit by credit card can leave you open to subsequent fraudulent use of your details.''\n\nNevertheless, Nigeria has a wide variety of hotels that cater to different tastes. Hotel chains like the Best Western, Radisson, Hilton, Mariott and Sheraton have several branches around the country. Local Hotels which offer an indigenous touch are also present. Companies like [https://hotels.ng/ '''hotels.ng'''] allow travelers to price check and find hotels anywhere in the country.\n\n==Education==\nThere are lots of private and public primary (elementary) and secondary (high) schools. It is worth it to organize a trip to whatever institution of learning you are interested in as this would give you a personal perspective on what facilities are available in your school of interest. There is a nationwide, standardized common entrance exam for students wishing to go into secondary schools, after they have completed their primary schooling. To gain admission into the universities (both public and private universities are in every state of the federation including the FCT), a prospective student has to sit for and successfully pass the UME(Universities Matriculation Examination) which is administered by JAMB (Joint Admission and Matriculation Board). Also individual universities regularly screen prospective candidates to make sure they are up to par for university level work.\n\n==Work==\nWorking in Nigeria can be a very positive experience. Nigerian organizations tend to operate like small families, taking in newcomers with open arms and avoiding the coolness and sterility that often characterize the Western professional work environment. For instance, don't even think about coming into the office in the morning without greeting each of your colleagues. Even if you don't, be sure that they will go out of their way to greet you and inquire about your well-being.\n\nAn eight-hour day (not including lunch) seems to be the norm, though it's not uncommon for people to stay late into the night and even come in for a few hours on weekends. Depending on the organization, a foreigner may be able to avoid this, but one should be prepared to work beyond the standard 35-40 hr work week. \n\nThe notion of \"African time\" applies very much to the work environment in Nigeria. Meetings are regularly held later than scheduled and often take longer than necessary. Although Nigerians will unabashedly admit to their habitual tardiness, rarely does one see efforts to correct this behavior.  The higher ones position, the later one may arrive at a meeting. On top of that, starting the meeting before the important people arrive is very rude--a common principle shared with many Western countries. One should note, however, that when dealing with foreign organizations, Nigerians will often make some efforts to correct this behavior, for some Nigerians are aware that their conception of punctuality is not shared by all.\n\nThose who are used to the strict North American conception of political correctness at the office may be shocked by the more liberal inter-sexual relations in the Nigerian workplace. Mild sexual jokes are common in meetings and in the office in general, though usually good natured and harmless. A white person working in an all-Nigerian workplace should also be prepared to frequently be reminded of their skin tone, though never in a nasty way. This can become tiresome, but Nigerians are generally very friendly. They use the term \"Oyinbo\" (white man in Yoruba) or \"Bature\" (white man in Hausa) as a form of affection.\n\nThe use of professional titles in written and verbal form is very common in Nigeria. Expect to address your boss as Sir, Doctor, Colonel, etc., and avoid using the first name of a superior unless given permission to do so. Being a foreigner, you will be forgiven for any faux pas, but it is always best to err on the side of caution and politeness.\n\nThe mobile phone (cell phone) is an essential tool for virtually all urban - and most rural - Nigerians. Because of the instability of local networks, many people have two or even three \"handsets\", each on a different network. Anyone doing business in the country for more than a few days should consider having a mobile phone.\n\n==Stay safe==\nNigeria is a fairly safe destination. It is highly advisable to travel with a Nigerian friend or visit a Nigerian friend, it could be your only way to enjoy the country to its fullest.\n\nYou can go to Abuja, the Capital. Although it is in the Central part of Nigeria, it houses most dignitaries and politicians, so it has a high level of security.\n\nCrime levels are high, particularly in [[Lagos]].\n\nBe wary of travelling by road outside of the cities at night due to the risk of armed robbery\n\nThe Niger delta area is '''unsafe for tourists'''. There is continual low-level violence between government and militant groups, and there have been several kidnappings of foreign oil workers.\n\nNorthern Nigeria is unsafe for foreigners (especially westerners) due to ethnic and religious tensions, lawlessness and the current activities of Islamist groups such as Boko Haram.\n\nEastern and Western Nigeria are the safer for foreigners.\n \nThe waters outside Nigeria is one of the most likely places to be attacked by modern day pirates.\n\n===LGBT travellers===\n{{warningbox|Homosexuality is '''ILLEGAL''' in Nigeria with penalties of up to death. LGBT travellers should be very cautious when travelling to Nigeria, especially in the North, where sharia law implementation can be strict due to the activities of Boko Haram, an Islamist group which engages in jihad. Both gays and lesbians can be executed. All public or private displays of affection are ''emphatically discouraged''.}}\n\n==Stay healthy==\n\nDo not risk unprotected sex with strangers or even with the person you think you know. Travellers to Nigeria are also required to vaccinate themselves against yellow fever, preferably 10 days before arrival in Nigeria. As malaria is prevalent, malaria pills and mosquito nets are also recommended. Polio vaccination in Nigeria is intermittent and there is currently a high rate of infection in the north of the country.\n\nSwan water is the safe drinking water to look for approx 80 naira  or 25 US cents for a big bottle. The cheap \"pure water\" sold in plastic bags is cheaper but not as \"pure\" as SWAN. EVA water, a brand by Coca Cola Company, is also safe.\n\nNote that Swan water is almost out of circulation. It was popular back then in the nineties but has lost its market control now. It is better to go for Eva water by Coca Cola company or Nestle water by Nestle Nigeria. It is also of extreme importance not to buy water outside good-looking shops.\n\nIt is advisable to purchase bottled water from convenience stores rather than by the roadside. These upscale convenience stores usually purchase their supplies directly from the suppliers, along with soft drinks such as Coca Cola and other bottled beverage products.\n\nFor the latest traveller's health information pertaining to Nigeria, including advisories and recommendations, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention destination page for [http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/nigeria.htm Nigeria].\n\n==Respect==\nIf you are speaking the language, some of the languages have different ways for someone to address someone older than themselves. \nYou do not hand things over to people, especially adults and people older than you, with your left hand. It's considered an insult. \n\nYou don't cross or jump over someone's legs if they are sitting with the legs extended out. It's considered bad luck. \n\nAvoid shaking hands with elders and older people in non Igbo villages. It's disrespectful to do that. Can you bow down a little? Kneeling or genuflecting for women or prostrating by men (especially among the Yoruba) is the normal thing to do. You may not need to do it either, but just show some form of respect when greeting older people. You can get away with not doing that in big cities or urban areas, they are less traditional there.\n\nIf you want to go out with anyone (friend, interest) whatever the sex, it is customary to allow the friend (if he/she is still living under their parent's or guardian's roof), to ask the parents/guardians first. The sense of 'youth independence' is virtually nonexistent until your friend moves out. The saying 'My roof; my rules', is not something you want to tamper with.\n\nWhen entering a house in the predominantly Muslim North, you have to let them know in advance that you are visiting so that the women can prepare (cover themselves up). Some Islamic customs require women to cover their hair and bodies to other men and this is practised in the North. Knock on the door and wait to be answered before going in. They will ask you to wait while the women are informed. Do not be offended by the wait.\n\nWhen entering a house in the metropolitan area, you (as a foreigner) or visitor should endeavour to find the owners of the house and greet them and let them know of your presence. Do this when you are leaving as well. It is customary for your hosts to entertain you with food and drinks.\n\nAirports can be stressful, as the organisation is a bit confusing particularly at Port Harcourt Airport. If you are White, be prepared to keep hold of a couple of \"dash\" (Envelopes with a couple of Niara or American dollars), Nothing big, just a small courtesy tip, as sometimes Airport security take longer searching your bags on purpose, as they know and or assume you are wealthy, hoping for a small dash in order to make your search easier.\n\nThis may not always be the case, but if a general states \"Do you have a coffee or mineral to give me\", this is a hint that they would appreciate some dash.\n\n==Contact==\nThe country code for Nigeria is 234. \n\nDialling out from Nigeria: you will need to dial the [[International Call Prefix]] for Nigeria of 009  (followed by the) [[Country code]] and then the local number including trunk code if any.\n\nThere is also a company in Nigeria, [http://elixirworldwide.com Elixir Communication Worldwide] that offers mobile phones for the blind and visually challenged. All the mobile operators have a roaming agreement with other mobile operators around the world.\n\n==Get out==\n* Travel north to [[Niger]], and into the Saharan desert.\n* Travel east to [[Cameroon]], for some mountain climbing.\n* Travel west to [[Benin]], the best way out when traveling to Europe overland.\n* Travel northeast to [[Chad]].\n\n{{outline}}\n{{isPartOf|West_Africa}}\n{{Wikipedia|Nigeria}}\n{{Countryguide}}\n\n\n[[ca:Nig\u00e8ria]]\n[[de:Nigeria]]\n[[eo:Ni\u011derio]]\n[[es:Nigeria]]\n[[fi:Nigeria]]\n[[fr:Nigeria]]\n[[hu:Nig\u00e9ria]]\n[[it:Nigeria]]\n[[ja:\u30ca\u30a4\u30b8\u30a7\u30ea\u30a2]]\n[[nl:Nigeria]]\n[[pl:Nigeria]]\n[[pt:Nig\u00e9ria]]\n[[ru:\u041d\u0438\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438\u044f]]\n[[sv:Nigeria]]\n[[zh:\u5c3c\u65e5\u5229\u4e9a]]\n[[wts:Category:Nigeria]]\n\n\n[[WikiPedia:Nigeria]]\n[[Dmoz:Africa/Nigeria/]]\n[[World66:africa/nigeria]]"

Many dream of its joie de vivre shown by the countless restaurants, picturesque villages and world-famous gastronomy. Some come to follow the trail of France's great philosophers, writers and artists, or to immerse in the beautiful language it gave the world. And others still are drawn to the country's geographical diversity with its long coastlines, massive mountain ranges and breathtaking farmland vistas.\n\n==Understand==\n\nFrance has been the world's most popular tourist destination for quite some time. It received 83.7 million visitors in 2014, although these figures are highly skewed by the number of people who frequent the country for the weekend, particularly to visit Disneyland Paris, Europe's most popular visitor attraction. France is one of the most geographically diverse countries in Europe, containing areas as different from each other as urban chic Paris, the sunny French Riviera, long Atlantic beaches, the winter sports resorts of the French Alps, the castles of the Loire Valley, rugged Celtic Brittany and the historian's dream that is Normandy.\n\nFrance is a country of rich emotions and turbulent politics but also a place of rational thinking and Enlightenment treasures. Above all, it is renowned for its cuisine, culture and history. \n\nIn the Caribbean, France borders the [[Netherlands]] via the French territory of [[Saint-Martin]] which borders the Dutch territory of [[Sint Maarten]]. Five oversea regions also form part of France: [[Martinique]] and [[Guadeloupe]] in the [[Caribbean]], [[French Guiana]] in [[South America]], and [[Reunion]] and [[Mayotte]], both off the coast of [[Madagascar]]. Numerous French oversea territories also exist around the Earth with varying status.\n\n===Climate===\nA lot of variety, but temperate winters and mild summers on most of the territory, and especially in [[Paris]]. Mild winters and hot summers along the Mediterranean and in the southwest (the latter has lots of rain in winter).  You may likely even see a few palm trees on the Mediterranean coast.  Mild winters (with lots of rain) and cool summers in the northwest ([[Brittany]]). Cool to cold winters and hot summer along the German border ([[Alsace]]). Along the Rh\u00f4ne Valley, there is an occasional strong, cold, dry, north-to-northwesterly wind known as the ''mistral''. \n\nCold winters with lots of the snow in the Mountainous regions: Alps, Pyrenees, Auvergne.\n__TOC__\n\n===Terrain===\nMostly flat plains or gently rolling hills in north and west; remainder is mountainous, especially [[Pyrenees]] in south west, [[Vosges]], [[Jura (France)|Jura]] and [[Alps]] in east, Massif Central in the mid south.\n\n===When to travel===\nIf possible, try to avoid French school holidays and Easter, because hotels are very likely to be overbooked and traffic on the roads is simply awful.\n\n*Holidays: search internet for \"French school holidays\", as they vary from region to region. Mostly, the winter holidays are 10 Feb-10 Mar. The spring holidays are often 10 Apr-10 May. Also try to avoid travel around the 14th of July. (''quatorze juillet'') These times the roads are full of people, leading to the much dreaded Black Friday traffic jams which can grow in length to over 160km (100 miles)!\n\nWinter gets very cold, sometimes freezing. Make sure to bring appropriate clothing to keep you warm while visiting. \n\nHotels are very likely to be overbooked and road traffic will be awful during the 1 May, 8 May, 11 Nov, Easter Weekend, Ascension weekend too.\n\n===History===\nFrance has been populated since the Neolithic period. The Dordogne region is especially rich in prehistoric caves, some used as habitation, others are temples with remarkable paintings of animals and hunters, like those found at [[Lascaux]], while others are simply incredible geological formations, like the gondola-navigable Gouffre de Padirac. \n\n====Rise and fall of the Roman empire====\nWritten History began in France with the invasion of the territory by the Romans, between 118 and 50&nbsp;BC. Starting then, the territory which is today called France was part of the Roman Empire, and the Gauls (name given to local Celts by the Romans), who lived there before Roman invasions, became acculturated \"Gallo-Romans\".\n\nWith the fall of the Roman empire, what was left were areas inhabited by descendants of intermarriages between Gallo-Romans and \"barbaric\" easterners (Mainly the Franks, but also other tribes like the \"burgondes\").\n\nThe legacy of the Roman presence is still visible, particularly in the southern part of the country where Roman circuses are still used for bullfights and rock and roll shows. Some of the main roads still follow the routes originally traced 2,000 years ago, and the urban organisation of many old town centres still transcript the ''cardo'' and the ''decumanus'' of the former Roman camp (especially [[Paris]]). The other main legacy was the Catholic Church which can be, arguably, considered as the only remnant of the civilization of that time\n\n====Middle-Ages====\nClovis, who died in 511, is considered as the first French king although his realm was not much more than the area of the present  \u00cele de France, around Paris. Charlemagne, who was crowned emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 800, was the first strong ruler. He united under his rule territories which extend today in Belgium, Germany and Italy. His capital was Aix-la-Chapelle (now in Germany, known as [[Aachen]]).\n\nThe country was under attack by the Vikings who came from the north and navigated upstream the rivers to plunder the cities and abbeys, it was also under attack from the south by the Muslim Saracens who were established in Spain. The Vikings were given a part of the territory (today's Normandy) in 911 and melted fast in the feudal system. The Saracens were stopped in 732 in [[Poitiers]] by Charles Martel, grand father of Charlemagne, a rather rough warrior who was later painted as a national hero. \n\nStarting with Charlemagne, a new society starts to settle, based on the personal links of feudalism. This era is named middle age. Although generally seen as an era of stagnation, it can more be described as a very complex mix of periods of economic and cultural developments (Music and poems of the Troubadours and Trouveres, building of the Romantic, then Gothic cathedrals), and recessions due to pandemic disease and wars.  \n\nIn 987, Hughes Capet was crowned as king of France ; he is the root of the royal families who later governed France. In 1154 much of the western part of France went under English rule with the wedding of Alienor d'Aquitaine to Henry II (Count of Anjou, born in the town of Le Mans). Some kings of the Plantagenet dynasty are still buried in France, the most famous being Richard I, of Walter Scott's fame, and  his father Henry II, who lies in the Abbaye de Fontevraud. The struggle between the English and French kings between 1337 and 1435 is known as the Hundred Years War and the most famous figure, considered as a national heroine, is Joan of Arc.\n\n====The making of a modern state nation====\nThe beginning of the 16th century saw the end of the feudal system and the emergence of France as a \"modern\" state with its border relatively close to the present ones (Alsace, Corsica, Savoy, the Nice region weren't yet French). Louis XIV who was king from 1643 to 1715 (72 years) was probably the most powerful monarch of his time. French influence extended deep in western Europe, its language was used in the European courts and its culture was exported all over Europe.\n\nThat era and the following century also saw the expansion of France on the other continents. This started a whole series of wars with the other colonial empires, mainly England (later Britain) and Spain over the control of North America, the Caribbean, South American, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\nThe French Revolution started in 1789, leading to the overthrow of King Louis XVI of the House of Bourbon and the creation of the First French Republic. Although this period was also fertile in bloody excesses it was, and still is, a reference for many other liberation struggles. In 1791, the other monarchies of Europe looked with outrage at the revolution and its upheavals, and considered whether they should intervene, either in support of the deposed King Louis XVI, or to prevent the spread of revolution, or to take advantage of the chaos in France. The French Revolutionary Wars were a series of major conflicts fought between the French Republic and several European Monarchies from 1792 to 1802.\n\nNapol\u00e9on Bonaparte seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat, reunited the country and declared himself Emperor of the French, he crowned by Pope Pius VII as Napoleon I of the French Empire, on 2 December 1804 at Notre Dame de Paris. His militaristic ambition which, at first, made him the ruler of most of western Europe were finally his downfall. In 1815 he was defeated in [[Waterloo]] (Belgium) by the Seventh Coalition - United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Nassau, Brunswick, and Prussia. He is still revered in some Eastern European countries as its armies and its government brought with them the ideas of the French philosophers.\n\n====20th and 21st centuries====\n1905 saw the separation of the Church from the State. This was a traumatic process, especially in rural areas. The French state carefully avoids any religious recognition. The Church was badly hurt and lost half its priests. In the long run, however, it gained autonomy\u2014for the French State no longer had a voice in choosing bishops. In the early 21st century, the French Institute of Public Opinion (IFOP) 2009 study, based on self declaration in a percentage of the total French population, 64.4% of the population identified as Catholic but with only 15.2% regularly attending or occasionally attending Mass, and 4.5% attending Mass weekly.  \n\nThe First World War (1914-1918) was a disaster for France, even though the country was ultimately a victor. At first many welcomed the war to avenge the humiliation of defeat and loss of territory to Germany following the Franco-Prussian War. However very high losses and almost no gain on the Western Front change opinions of the war. A significant part of the male workforce was killed or disabled and a large part of the country and industry destroyed. When the Second World War (1939-45) was declared there was little enthusiasm and much dread in France at the prospect of enduring another major war. In the spring of 1940 Hitler's army invaded France, the army and government of the Third French Republic collapse and France surrendered in June of 1940. With British troops fleeing France an atmosphere of humiliation and defeat swept over the country. On the other hand, the French Resistance conducted sabotage operations inside German-occupied France. To support the Allied invasion of Normandy in June 1944, various groups increased their sabotage and guerilla attacks. \n\nSince the end of WWII France went through a period of reconstruction and prosperity came back with the development of industry. The Fifth Republic (1958-to the present) emerged from the collapse of the French Fourth Republic (1946-58) and replaced the prior parliamentary government with a semi-presidential system. It is France's third-longest-enduring political regime, after the pre-French Revolution Ancien R\u00e9gime and the Third Republic. \n\nFrance began the process of decolonisation after a rise in nationalism following WWII. \n\nIn 1963 France and West Germany signed the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Treaty, known as the Friendship Treaty, the treaty established a new foundation for relations that ended centuries of rivalry between them. France would play a role in what would eventually became the European Union. One of the most visible consequence being the introduction in 2002 of the Euro (\u20ac), now the common currency of eighteen of the twenty-eight EU members and also used by seven other European countries.\n\nIn 2014, France was a republic with a President elected for a 5-year term (officially the ''French Republic'' and some would describe it as a \"Unitary semi-presidential and constitutional republic\"). Some current main issues are the further integration of the country into the EU and the adoption of common standards for the economy, defence, immigrant rights, and so on. \n\nThe ban on religious symbols of 15 March 2004 in public schools is an application of the French policy of ''la\u00efcit\u00e9'' (secularism) under which religious symbols such as Muslim veils, Jewish Kippahs and Sikh turbans have been banned from schools. This has meant that the guarantees for freedom of religion have been curtailed for faith groups in France. Although France is extremely safe, anyone from an openly religious, faith community may  still need to exercise care when travelling in France.\n\n===Electricity===\n'''Electricity''' is supplied at 220 to 230V 50Hz. Outlets are CEE7/5 (protruding male earth pin) and accept either CEE 7/5 (Grounded), CEE 7/7 (Grounded) or CEE 7/16 (non-grounded) plugs. Older German-type CEE 7/4 plugs are not compatible as they do not accommodate the earth pin found on this type of outlet. However, most modern European appliances are fitted with the hybrid CEE 7/7 plug which fits both CEE 7/5 (Belgium & France) and CEE 7/4 (Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and most of Europe) outlets.\n\n'''Plugs''' Travellers from the UK, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland and other countries using 230V 50Hz which use different plugs simply require a plug adaptor to use their appliances in France. Plug adaptors for plugs from the US and UK are available from electrical and \"do-it-yourself\" stores such as Bricorama.\n\n'''Voltage:''' Travellers from the US, Canada, Japan and other countries using 110V, 60Hz may need a voltage converter. However, some laptops, mobile phone chargers and other devices can accept either 110V or 230V so only require a simple plug adaptor. Check the voltage rating plates on your appliances before connecting them.\n\n==Regions==\nMetropolitan France is divided into 13 administrative regions, which themselves can be grouped into seven cultural regions:\n\n{{Regionlist\n| regionmap=France-regions.png\n| regionmaptext=Regions of France\n| regionmapsize=upright=2\n\n| region1name=[[\u00cele-de-France]]\n| region1color=#dde58b\n| region1items=\n| region1description=The region surrounding the French capital, [[Paris]].\n\n| region2name=[[Northern France]]\n| region2color=#608860\n| region2items=[[Nord-Pas de Calais]], [[Picardy]], [[Normandy]]\n| region2description=A region where the world wars have left many scars.\n\n| region3name=[[Northeastern France]]\n| region3color=#b383b3\n| region3items=[[Alsace]], [[Lorraine]], [[Champagne-Ardenne]], [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]]\n| region3description=A region where wider European culture (and especially Germanic culture) has merged with the French, giving rise to interesting results. \n\n| region4name=[[Great West]]\n| region4color=#c5995c\n| region4items=[[Brittany]], [[Pays de la Loire]]\n| region4description=An agriculture-based oceanic region with a culture greatly influenced by the ancient Celtic peoples.\n\n| region5name=[[Central France]]\n| region5color=#6698bb\n| region5items=[[Centre-Val de Loire]], [[Poitou-Charentes]], [[Burgundy]], [[Limousin]], [[Auvergne]]\n| region5description=A largely agricultural and vinicultural region, featuring river valleys, ch\u00e2teaux and historic towns.\n\n| region6name=[[Southwestern France]]\n| region6color=#a4c28d\n| region6items=[[Aquitaine]], [[Midi-Pyrenees]]\n| region6description=A region of sea and wine, with nice beaches over the Atlantic Ocean and young high mountains close to [[Spain]]. \n\n| region7name=[[Southeastern France]]\n| region7color=#c8b7b7\n| region7items=[[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]], [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], [[Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur]], [[Corsica]]\n| region7description=The primary tourist region of the country outside of Paris, with a warm climate and azure sea, contrasting with the mountainous French Alps.}}\n\n[[Image:Chateau de Chantilly garden.jpg|thumb|Chantilly gardens, Paris, \u00cele-de-France]]\n[[Image:Stjosephs.JPG|thumb|St Joseph's Church by August Peret, Le Havre, Normandy, Northern France]] \n[[Image:LeHavreHoteldeVille.JPG|thumb|Hotel de Ville decorated to celebrate its inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List, Le Havre, Normandy, Northern France]]\n[[Image:Lille-Place-du-General-de-Gaulle.jpg|thumb|Place du General de Gaulle, Lille, Nord-Pas de Calais, Northern France]]\n\nEach administrative region is divided into a number of '''departments'''.

All other visa-exempt nationals are exempt from holding a visa for short-term employment ''if they possess a valid work permit'' and can present this work permit at the port of entry, with limited exceptions. However, this ability to work visa-free does not necessarily extend to other Schengen countries. For more information, visit [http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/coming-to-france/getting-a-visa/article/foreign-nationals-holding-ordinary this webpage of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs].\n\n===France Visa requirements===\nForeign nationals who are ''not'' visa-exempt (e.g. South Africans) must make a 'declaration of entry' (d\u00e9claration d'entr\u00e9e) at a police station or to border inspection personnel if they arrive in France directly from another country of Schengen Area (e.g. [[Italy]]), unless they hold a long-term visa or residence permit issued by a Schengen member state. Their passports will be endorsed by the authorities to prove that such [http://vosdroits.service-public.fr/particuliers/F2716.xhtml a declaration has been made].\n\n{{Infobox|Reading up|Before you leave you may want to read a book like ''French or Foe'' by Polly Platt or ''Almost French'' by Sarah Turnbull \u2014 interesting, well written records from English speaking persons who live in France. For the adult reader interested in the famous reputation enjoyed by Paris for romance and sensuality, try \"SENSUAL PARIS: Sex, Seduction and Romance in the Sublime City of Light\" by Jonathan LeBlanc Roberts}}\nIf you intend to stay in France for longer than 90 days, regardless of purpose and with extremely few exceptions, an advance long-stay visa is ''always'' required of non-EEA or non-Swiss citizens. It is almost impossible to switch from a \"C\" (visitor) entry status to a \"D\" (long-stay) status from inside France, and you must apply for a long-stay visa in-person at the consulate responsible for your place of residence.\n\nAs of 2009, certain categories of long-stay visa, such as visitor (''visiteur''), family (''vie priv\u00e9e et familiale''), student (''\u00e9tudiant''), intern (''stagiaire''), scientist/researcher (''scientifique-chercheur''), salaried worker (''salari\u00e9''), and short-term worker (''travailleur temporaire''), do not require holders to obtain a separate residence permit (''carte de s\u00e9jour'') for the first year of stay in France. However, the long-stay visa must be validated by the ''Office Fran\u00e7aise de l'Immigration et de l'Int\u00e9gration'' (OFII) within the first three months of entering France to be valid for longer than those three months. This is done by sending in a form to the OFII received along with the visa with the address of residence in France, completing a medical examination, and attending an introductory meeting to validate the visa. The tax required for validation (\u20ac58 for students and interns, but \u20ac241 for workers '''except''' those under the short-term worker category and for scientists, visitors, and family) is, as of February 2013, collected at the end of the validation process inside France. This validated visa will serve as a residence permit and, likewise, allow travel throughout the other Schengen countries for up to 90 days in a six-month period. To stay in France after a validated visa expires, however, and/or if you hold a visa which states ''carte de s\u00e9jour \u00e0 solliciter d\u00e8s l'arriv\u00e9e'', a ''carte de s\u00e9jour'' (residence permit card) must be obtained at the ''pr\u00e9fecture'' responsible for your place of residence within two months of entry into France or two months before the visa expires. Please consult [http://www.ofii.fr/venir_en_france_obtenir_son_titre_de_sejour_vls_ts_193/index.html?sub_menu=9 the OFII website for more information]. \n\nFrench overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM) are '''not''' part of the Schengen Area and operate a separate immigration regime from mainland France. As such, if you intend to visit them, you will need a separate visa (if required for your nationality).\n\n===By plane===\n\n====Flights to/from Paris====\nThe main international airport, [http://www.easycdg.com '''Roissy - Charles de Gaulle'''] ({{IATA|CDG}}) is likely to be your port of entry if you fly into France from outside Europe. CDG is the home of Air France (AF), the national company, for most intercontinental flights. AF and the companies forming the SkyTeam Alliance (Dutch KLM, Aeromexico, Alitalia, Delta Air Lines, Korean Air,) use Terminal 2 while most other foreign airlines use Terminal 1. A third terminal is used for charter flights. If transferring through CDG (especially between the various terminals) it is important to leave substantial time between flights. Ensure you have no less than one hour between transfers. Add more if you have to change terminals as you will need to clear through security.\n\nTransfers to another flight in France: AF operates domestic flights from CDG too, but a lot of domestic flights, and also some internal European flights, use '''Orly''', the second Paris airport. For transfers within CDG you can use the free bus shuttle linking all terminals, train station, parking lots and hotels on the platform. For transfers to Orly there is a bus link operated by AF (free for AF passengers). The two airports are also linked by a local train (RER) which is slightly less expensive, runs faster but is much more cumbersome to use with heavy luggage. AF has agreements with the SNCF, the national rail company, which operates TGVs (see below) out of CDG airports (some trains carry flight numbers). The TGV station is in Terminal 2 and is on the route of the free shuttle. For transfers to the city centre of Paris, see [[Paris]]. [http://www.paristarshuttle.com/indexfr.html Paris Star Shuttle] offers transfers from CDG into Paris.\n\nSome low-cost airlines, including Ryanair and Volare, fly to '''Beauvais''' airport situated about 80km northwest of Paris.

The path leads almost exclusively through inhabited areas in the community of Mont-Saint-Martin (yet partially in a forest if you go to/from Halanzy) and takes some 7&nbsp;km.

Since 2009/2010, when flying from metropolitan France to these 5 DOM-TOM, there are only immigration checks on departure from metropolitan France (immigration checks on arrival in these 5 DOM-TOM have been removed). However, when flying from these 5 DOM-TOM to metropolitan France, there are immigration checks both on departure from the DOM-TOM and upon arrival in metropolitan (known in French as ''double contr\u00f4le d\u2019identit\u00e9''). For EU, EEA and Swiss citizens, a valid passport or national identity card is sufficient for the immigration checks both in metropolitan France and in the DOM-TOMs. Non-EU/EEA/Swiss citizens who are visa-exempt for metropolitan France will also be visa-exempt for the DOM-TOMs (and, in addition, certain nationalities which require a visa for metropolitan France/Schengen Area will not require one for the DOM-TOMs).\n\nIt is possible to reach the French overseas territories of Saint Barth\u00e9lemy and Saint Martin (L'Esp\u00e9rance Airport) from metropolitan France by transiting onto a connecting flight at Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre in Guadeloupe without stopping in a third country. Therefore, it is possible for EU, EEA and Swiss citizens to visit these territories with a national identity card only (and not a passport).\n\nThe following carriers offer flights between metropolitan France and DOM-TOM with a stopover in a third country:\n# '''Air France''' [http://www.airfrance.com] (French Polynesia (Papeete) via the United States (Los Angeles)\n# '''Air Tahiti Nui''' [https://www.airtahitinui.com/] (French Polynesia (Papeete) via the United States (Los Angeles))\n\nTo reach the other DOM-TOM (New Caledonia, Saint Pierre and Miquelon and Wallis and Futuna) from metropolitan France, it is necessary to transit between connecting flights in a third country.\n\n===By car===\n''See also:'' [[Driving in France]]\n\nFrance drives on the right.\n\nA French driver flashing headlights is asserting right of way and warning you of intentions and presence. Do not use it to mean thanks. Flashing headlights can also mean, \"''Watch out as there's a police speed-check ahead of you!''\" Horns should be used only in legitimate emergencies; use of the horn in urban areas outside such circumstances might win you a traffic ticket. Parisian drivers were notorious for honking their horns at anything and everything, though increased enforcement has greatly reduced this practice.\n\nFrance has a well-developed system of highways. Most of the motorway (''autoroute'') links are toll roads, marked as ''P\u00e9age''. Some have toll stations giving you access to a section, others have entrance and exit toll stations. Don't lose your entrance ticket or you will be charged for the longest distance. All toll stations accept major credit cards although may not accept foreign credit cards, or you can use the automatic booth, but only if your card is equipped with a chip. Foreigners can get such a chip at tolltickets.com.\n\nRoads range from the narrow single-lane roads in the countryside to major highways. Most towns and cities were built before the general availability of the automobile and thus city centres tend to be unwieldy for cars. Keep this in mind when renting: large cars can be very unwieldy. It often makes sense to just park and then use public transportation.\n\n====Renting a car====\nOnce you land in France you may need to use car hire services. Most of the leading companies operate from French airports and there is good merit in booking car hire in advance. It is a regular experience at smaller French airports to not get the type of car you booked online but an alternative model. Sometimes the alternative model is quite different so check carefully before accepting the vehicle and stand your ground if it does not match your booking request and is not suitable to your needs.\n\nMost cars in France are equipped with standard transmissions, a fact that derives equally from the preferences of the driving public and the peculiarities of French licensing laws (automatic transmissions are generally only used by the elderly or those with physical disabilities). This extends to vehicle categories that in the US are virtually never equipped with a manual transmission, such as vans and large sedans. Accordingly, virtually all of the vehicles available for rent at the average car hire depot will be equipped with a manual gearbox. If you do not know how to drive a car with a manual transmission and don't have the time to learn before your trip, be certain to reserve your rental car well in advance and confirm your reservation. Otherwise, you may find yourself in a car that is much larger than you can afford (or with no car at all).\n\nIt is a good tip when travelling in numbers to get one member of the party with hand luggage to go straight through to the car hire desk ahead of everybody else, this will avoid the crush once the main luggage is picked up from the conveyor.\n\nFor short term rentals, you will find numerous familiar big name agencies (Hertz, SIXT, Avis, Alamo) which you can book through a number of online portals and compare prices side by side (Orbitz, Kayak, Expedia). All of the above rental agencies usually have similar pricing, vehicles and rental policies. Although it not recommended, one will usually be able to wait until near last minute to book online and still get a car when it comes to short term rentals. In fact, there has been a recent surge in the last-minute car rental market, with an increasing number of start-ups promoting low-cost car hire services in different ways. One of these growing trends is car-pooling, which has exploded in the last decade. In fact, most of the biggest names in the market, such as BlaBlaCar and Covoiturage, are originally from France, though they have now expanded in neighbouring countries. Another novelty in this market, which is attracting a lot of attention, is renting cars for one-way trips around France, for one symbolic euro. Indeed, French startups such as DriiveMe now offer one-way, city-to-city car rentals for one Euro net by putting in relation the logistical and car-conveying aspect of the car hire business to the demand side. These innovative solutions and growing trends highlight a growing market and new possibilities for people to travel cheaply throughout France. \n\nHowever, for rentals exceeding three weeks in duration, it is often advantageous to use a \"short term\" lease buy back programs in which you need to book at least a few weeks in advance before departing. The lease buy back programs are uniquely French and offer a tax-free alternative to car rentals that can often have an overall lower cost and better value than a traditional car rental. The programs are typically run by the big three French auto makers Peugeot, Renault, and Citroen. Short term leasing offers clients a brand new vehicle, full insurance, unlimited mileage, and flexible driving rules compared to traditional car rentals. You must be a NON European resident to take part in this and one downfall is that you must have need for a car for more then three weeks in order to benefit from the service. Only certain agencies are authorized to sell these leases to US residents. Some of them include; Auto France, Inc. Peugeot(US), Citroen Europass (US), Renault USA (US).\n\n===By thumb===\nFrance is a dreadful country for [[Tips for hitchhiking|hitchhiking]] - especially if you're male. Be patient, prepare yourself for a long wait or walk and in the meantime enjoy the landscape. A ride will come along in a few days since a lot of foreigners are on French roads. People who stop are usually friendly and not dangerous. They will like you more if you speak a little French. They never expect any money for the ride. \n\nRemember that getting out of Paris by thumb is almost impossible. You can try your luck at the portes, but heavy traffic and limited areas for stopping will try your patience. It's a good idea to take the local train to a nearby suburb as your chance of being picked up will increase dramatically.\n\nOutside Paris, it's advisable to try your luck after roundabouts. As it's illegal to hitchhike on the motorways (autoroutes) and they are well observed by the police, you may try on a motorway entry. The greatest chance is at toll plazas (''stations de p\u00e9age''), some of which require all cars to stop and are thus great places to catch a lift. Some tollbooths are really good, some not so good. If you've been waiting for a while with an indication of where to go, drop it and try with your thumb only. And also, you can try to get a ride to the next good spot in the wrong direction.\n\nNote, though, that hitching from a p\u00e9age, while a common practice, isn't legal and French police or highway security, who are normally very tolerant of hitchhikers, may stop and force you to leave. You can get free maps in the toll offices - these also indicate where you can find the \"all-stop-P\u00e9age\".\n\n===By train===\n{{Infobox|Your rights as a rail passenger|\n*On TGV and Intercit\u00e9s trains, your rights are covered by the SNCF's ''''Garantie Voyage'''' passenger charter:\n**'''Information guarantee''' (To ensure that you are kept informed and updated about schedule changes/cancellations by SNCF staff and station announcements/screens/signs)\n**'''Ticket change/refund guarantee''' (If your train is cancelled or delayed by more than 1 hour, you can change the ticket to take another train within the next 48 hours on the same or a 'comparable' routing, or receive a full refund, including a refund of the return journey if you no longer wish to travel.)\n**'''Seat guarantee''' (If you travel for more than 1hr30mins on a train with obligatory reservations on a ticket that states 'sans place attribu\u00e9e' (no allocated seat), the train conductor will find you a seat, and if not, you will be offered a travel voucher of between \u20ac10 and \u20ac30 on the spot depending on the comfort of your journey, the journey length and the ticket price.)\n**'''Assistance guarantee''' (For delays over 1 hour, you will be provided with a 'suitable and proportionate level of assistance'.

If the situation cannot be resolved to your satisfaction, you should keep your ticket and proof of any expenses which you incurred but which should have been covered by SNCF (e.g. food and drinks in the event of a delay). After your journey, to request a reimbursement of expenses which you incurred, get in touch with SNCF Customer Services (postal address: Service Relation Client SNCF - 62973 ARRAS Cedex 9; make sure to specify that you are contacting them in relation to the SNCF 'Garantie Voyage'), which is obliged to respond within one month. Note that the 'G30' compensation scheme (see above) has a [http://www.sncf.com/fr/engagements/g30 separate online form] which needs to be submitted within 60 days of the delay.

(''French Civil Code, Articles 1147 and 1150'') This legal right is separate to the passenger rights in the 'Garantie Voyage' charter, and can therefore be useful either if you are not covered by the 'Garantie Voyage' charter, or if your losses are not fully compensated by the charter. For example, if your train was scheduled to arrive at your destination station at 5:45pm, but was delayed by 25 mins and so arrived at 6:10pm, which meant that you could not pick up the hire car which you had booked as the car rental office in the station closed at 6pm, and so you had to take a taxi to reach your final destination, SNCF is legally obliged to compensate you for the cost of the taxi ride (and any no-show car rental charges) if both losses were foreseeable (e.g. if at the time you booked your train ticket on the SNCF website, you selected the option to book car rental at the same time on the booking page). Note that technical faults (e.g. engine/signalling failures), weather conditions (e.g. storms, snowfall) and strikes (except for surprise, unannounced strikes) are '''not''' considered by French courts to be ''force majeure'' events.\n}}\nTrains are a great way to get around in France. You can get pretty much from anywhere to anywhere else by train. For long distances, use the TGV (''Train a Grande Vitesse'' \u2013 High-Speed Train; to be re-branded to 'inOui' starting from July 2017) on which reservations are obligatory. But, if you have time, take the slower regional train and enjoy the scenery. The landscape is part of what makes France one of the top tourist destinations in the world.\n\nThe French national railway network is managed by R\u00e9seaux Ferr\u00e9s de France, and most of the trains are run by the '''SNCF''' [http://www.sncf.com/indexe.htm] (''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 nationale des chemins de fer fran\u00e7ais''). For interregional trains you can get schedules and book tickets online. For regional trains, schedules can be found at ter-sncf.com [http://www.ter-sncf.com/index.asp] (choose your region, then \"Carte and horaires\" for maps and timetables). Booking is available in two classes: ''premi\u00e8re classe'' (first class) is less crowded and more comfortable but can also be about 50% more expensive than ''deuxi\u00e8me classe'' (second class). Note that if your TGV is fully booked, step aboard seconds before the doors close, and look for the guard (\"contr\u00f4leur\"). He will find you a seat somewhere.\n\nThere are a number of different kinds of high-speed and regular trains:\n\n* ''TER'' (''Train Express R\u00e9gional''): Regional trains and the backbone of the SNCF system. TER are slow but do serve most stations. Available on [[Eurail]] and [[InterRail]] passes.\n\n* ''Intercit\u00e9s'': As of 2012, the bundling of the former Corail services. Includes trains with compulsory reservation (former ''T\u00e9oz'' and the ''Lun\u00e9a'' night trains) and those for which reservations are optional (former ''Intercit\u00e9s''). The reservation-optional trains are what one will often use on passes. Some trains go to regions that the TGV services don't, namely in Auvergne.\n\n* ''TGV'' (''Trains \u00e0 Grande Vitesse''; to be re-branded to 'inOui' starting from July 2017): The world-famous French high-speed trains run several times a day to the Southeast [[Nice]](5-6h), Marseille (3h) and [[Avignon]] (2.5 h), the East [[Geneva]] (3h) or [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Dijon]] (1h15) , the Southwest [[Bordeaux]] (3h), the West [[Rennes]] (2h), [[Nantes]] (2h), [[Brest (France)|Brest]] (4h) and the North [[Lille]] (1h). Eurostar to London (2h15) and Thalys to Brussels (1h20) use almost identical trains. Reservations are compulsory.\n\n* ''OUIGO'' [http://www.ouigo.com]: Another low-cost version of the TGV with tickets starting from \u20ac10. (Note that OUIGO does not go to central Paris, but rather Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e/Chessy TGV station, which is 50 mins by RER A train from central Paris.) Tickets are only available online on the OUIGO website and must be printed out, or booked via the OUIGO mobile app. Also, an identity document (passport, national identity card or driving licence) must be presented with the ticket when boarding the train.\n\nIf you'll be doing more than about 2 return journeys in France and are younger than 26, getting a \"Carte 12-25\" will save you money.  They cost \u20ac50, last a year, and give anywhere from a 25% to 60% discount depending on when you book the ticket and when you travel.\n\nBooking tickets online can be quite a confusing process as it is possible to book the same journey through a number of different websites (in different languages and currencies). The fares are not always consistent so it pays to check the same trip on a number of sites.\n\n* '''www.voyages-sncf.com''' [http://www.voyages-sncf.com/] This is the French language booking website of the SNCF.

Confusingly this site has a completely different layout and style from the French language version. There are a few strange quirks.

Contrary to a common misunderstanding, this web site allows you to order even if you live in the US; it is not concerned where you live, but where you will pick up the tickets or have them sent; thus if you wish to pick up the tickets at a SNCF train station or office, answer \"France\". When at the station, just go to the counter (\"Guichet\") and ask to have your ticket issued (\"retirer votre billet\").  You can ask \"Je voudrais retirer mon billet, s'il vous plait\", or 'zhe voo dray ruh teer ay mon bee yay, sill voo play' and then hand them the paper with the reference number.  \n\nTo find your train, locate your train number and the departure time on the departures board. There will be a track (\"Voie\") number next to the train and departure time. Follow signs to that track to board the train.  You will have a reserved seat on TGV trains. On other long-distance trains, you can optionally make reservations (at least one day in advance); if you do not have one you may use any unused seat not marked as reserved. To find your reserved seat, first look for the train coach number (\"Voit. No\"). Pay attention to the possible confusion between track number (Voi'''e''') and coach (voiture) number (abbreviated Voi'''t''')  As you go down the track, the coach number will be displayed on an LCD screen on the car, or maybe just written in the window or right next to the doors.\n\nThe reserved seat rules are lax; you are allowed if you switch seats or use another seat (of the same class of course) if it is empty because the TGV is not fully booked or the other person agrees to switch with you. The only requirement is not to continue using a reserved seat if the person holding the reservation claims it.\n\nOn the main lines, TGVs often run in twos. There are two possibilities: either the two TGVs are considered as one train with one train number (in this case each coach has a different number); or the two TGVs are considered as separate trains which run together during a part of their journey, with two different train numbers (in this case, the two trains may have two close numbers such as 1527 and 1537), and each train will have its own coach numbering. So be sure you are in the right train (the train number is shown on the LCD screen, with the coach number).\n\nIf you are early, there is often a map somewhere on the track that will show how the train and car numbers will line up on the track according to letters that appear either on the ground or on signs above. That way, you can stand by the letter corresponding with your coach number and wait to board the train closest to your coach. You can easily go from one coach to another, so if you are very late, jump in any coach of the same class before the train starts, wait until most people are seated, then walk to your coach and seat number.\n\n'''Beware''': To avoid any form of fraud, your ticket '''must''' be punched by an automatic machine (\"composteur\") ''before entering the platform area'' to be valid. Older machines are bright orange, newer machines are yellow and gray. The machines are situated at the entrance of all platforms. Failure to punch the ticket may entitle you to a fine even if you are a foreigner with a limited French vocabulary, depending on how the conductor feels, unless you approach the conductor as quickly as possible and request that your ticket be validated. Likewise if you step aboard a train without a ticket, you '''must''' find the conductor (\"contr\u00f4leur\") and tell him about your situation before he finds you.\n\nFrench information booths, especially in larger train stations, can be quite unhelpful, especially if you do not understand much French. If something does not seem to make sense, just say \"excusez-moi\" and they should repeat it. \n\nNight train services also exist. These include ''couchettes'' second class (6 bunk beds in a compartment), first class (4 bunks) and Reclining seats.\n''Wagon-lits'' (a compartment with 2 real beds) were totally withdrawn from French overnight trains. However, you can ask for a \"private room\" (in first class). Night trains have occasionally been targeted by criminals, though this is not a widespread problem.\n\n====Taking a dog====\nDogs are allowed on trains in France. Dogs that fit in a carrier (maximum 55 x 30 x 30cm) travel for \u20ac6, while larger dogs travel for 50% of the full adult fare. Ouigo and IDTGV have a set fare of \u20ac30 and \u20ac35 respectively each way for larger dogs. For more information on where to go in France with your dog, how to get there and where to stay, check out ''France: A Woof Guide'' by Paul Wojnicki.\n\n====''Troc des trains''====\nAs it is cheaper to book and purchase train tickets, especially those with reservations, in advance, there is a relatively lively trading of non-exchangeable and non-reimburseable train tickets on the Internet. See http://www.trocdestrains.com/recherche-billet-train.html and http://www.kelbillet.com/billet-de-train-pas-cher/\n\n===By taxi===\n{{Infobox|Your rights as a taxi passenger|\n*At a taxi stand/rank, you have the right to choose any taxi you want and not necessarily the first taxi at the front, unless there is a queue of taxis. Taxi drivers are forbidden from soliciting customers, so you should never feel threatened to choose a particular vehicle.\n*Make sure that the driver is a legally authorised taxi driver by checking his/her ''carte professionnelle''. Also check that the vehicle is an authorised taxi which has a 'TAXI' panel at the top, a taximeter and a sheet displayed with the tariff information.\n*The taxi driver cannot refuse to take you unless his/her shift is about to end, your luggage cannot be moved by hand, you have a pet with you (not including guide dogs), you are clearly inebriated, you attempt to hail the taxi within 50 metres of a taxi stand/rank or your clothing or belongings will damage the inside of the taxi. The taxi driver cannot refuse to take you if you are a disabled passenger, and if you have a wheelchair, must carry it free of charge.\n*The driver cannot refuse to carry 4 passengers. Depending on the capacity of the taxi, the driver can refuse to carry 5 or more passengers.\n*You have the right to choose any passenger seat (including the front seat) inside the taxi.\n*The driver will often (but is not obliged) to help you with your baggage.\n*The route taken by the driver to your destination must be the most direct (you are entitled to ask the driver to take a route preferred by you and the driver cannot refuse).\n*You are obliged to wear your seat belt. Smoking is prohibited inside the taxi by both the driver and the passenger.\n*The use of a car seat for passengers under the age of 10 is not obligatory inside taxis.\n*The driver cannot carry anyone else other than you and your companions. On the other hand, you are free to request the driver to drop off/pick up any of your companions along the journey.\n*The taxi driver is obliged to accept payment by cash. Many taxi drivers accept payment by card (though this is not a legal obligation, so check with the driver in advance if you want to pay by card).\n*There must be a notice inside the taxis (in 3 languages \u2013 French, English and Spanish) with details of the fare calculation and the contact details if you wish to make a complaint.\n*The minimum charge for a taxi ride is 7\u20ac (inclusive of any supplemental charges).\n*You can request a receipt from the taxi driver if you wish. If the ride costs less than 25\u20ac, the taxi driver can refuse to issue a receipt (though this is rare). If the ride costs 25\u20ac or more, the taxi driver is legally obliged to issue a receipt.\n*It is customary to leave a tip (rounding up to the nearest Euro) for the driver if he/she has done a good job. However, there is no legal obligation to leave such a tip.\n}}\nIn France, taxis carry up to 9 passengers and are clearly marked with a 'TAXI' panel on top of the vehicle. The 'TAXI' panel will be green if the taxi is available and red if occupied or enroute to pick up a passenger. The term ''''taxi'''' in France is the equivalent of a '''public hire taxi/cab''' in English-speaking countries - you can take a taxi either by '''hailing one on the street''', '''going to a taxi stand/rank''' (''station de taxi'') or '''booking one through a taxi operator''' (''central de radio taxi''). On the other hand, the term ''''VTC'''' (''voiture de transport avec chauffeur'') (see section below) in France is the equivalent of a '''private hire taxi/minicab''' in English-speaking countries - you can only take a VTC if it has been '''pre-booked'''.\n\nAlthough, in general, you will be able to get a taxi relatively easily by going to a taxi stand (which you will often be able to find at airports, railway stations, town centres etc), you may need to book a taxi during peak hours, in rural towns/communities or if you require a large taxi. In Paris, you can book a taxi through the '''central taxi switchboard''' (tel: 01 45 30 30 30) or one of the 3 main taxi operators: '''Taxis G7''' [http://www.taxisg7.fr/], '''Alpha Taxis''' [http://www.alphataxis.fr/] and '''Taxis Bleus''' [https://www.taxis-bleus.com/]. Outside Paris, you can find a list of taxi operators and independent taxi drivers by searching in the '''Yellow Pages''' (''Pages Jaunes''). \n\nIf you hail a taxi on the street without making a booking, the taximeter should only start at the moment you board the vehicle and should not already be running. If you book a taxi in Paris, the taximeter can only start running at the scheduled pick-up time (or, if the taxi is booked for an immediate pick-up, when it arrives at the pick-up point). If the taxi arrives at the pick-up point late after the scheduled pick-up time, the taximeter can only start running when it arrives at the pick-up point. Note that if you book a taxi in Paris, the taxi driver can charge an additional fee of up to \u20ac4 (for a booking for immediate pick-up) or \u20ac7 (for an advance booking) known as the ''suppl\u00e9ment forfaitaire pour r\u00e9servation''. If you book a taxi ''outside Paris'', the taximeter may already be running when it arrives at the pick-up point. This is legally permitted outside Paris as the taxi driver is allowed to turn on the meter as soon as he/she receives the request from the operator to pick you up (this journey to the pick-up point is known as the 'course d'approche'). Outside Paris, the taxi driver is not permitted to charge a ''suppl\u00e9ment forfaitaire pour r\u00e9servation''. \n\nAll taxis are obliged to have a '''taximeter''' (''taxim\u00e8tre''). The fare will be determined according to the taximeter. The fare displayed on the taximeter is calculated according to the tariff which is set annually by the ''d\u00e9partement'' where the taxi has been registered. The tariff information must be clearly displayed on a sheet inside the taxi. As of 2017, in Paris, the taxi fare is calculated based on a pick-up charge of \u20ac2.60 and 3 different types of tariffs (Tariff A is \u20ac1.06 per km/\u20ac32.10 per hour and applies Monday to Saturday from 10am to 5pm; Tariff B is \u20ac1.30 per km/\u20ac38.10 per hour and applies Monday to Saturday from 5pm to 10am, Sundays from 7am to midnight and all day on public holidays; Tariff C is \u20ac1.58 per km/\u20ac35.80 per hour and applies on Sundays from 12am to 7am). Outside Paris, the pick-up charge varies from \u20ac0.50 to \u20ac3.83 and there are 4 different types of tariffs (Tariff A applies for a return journey during the day Monday to Saturday; Tariff B a return journey during the evening Monday to Saturday and all day Sundays and public holidays; Tariff C a single journey during the day Monday to Saturday; Tariff D a single journey during the evening Monday to Saturday and all day Sundays and public holidays). The taximeter must indicate which type of tariff is being used to calculate the taxi fare. When a taxi is stationary or moving slowly, the taximeter calculates the fare per hour instead of per kilometre.\n\nIn addition to the fare indicated on the metre, the taxi driver is permitted to add certain '''fare supplements''' (e.g. 4th passenger supplement outside Paris; 5th passenger supplement of \u20ac4 in Paris; baggage supplement; pet animal supplement; supplement for picking up from a railway station or airport). However, all fare supplements must be clearly stated on the taxi fare information sheet displayed inside the taxi. If there are any road tolls, the taxi driver can only add the cost of the road toll to the fare if the passenger has agreed in advance, otherwise the fare includes the cost of the road toll. Road tolls can never been added to the fare if they were incurred during the 'course d'approche' before the driver picked up the passenger.\n\nThe tariff set by the ''depart\u00e9ment'' where the taxi has been registered (which is the basis for the calculation by the taximeter) is the '''maximum amount''' which the taxi driver can legally charge for the taxi ride. However, you are free to ask for a quote (''demande de devis'')/negotiate another amount for the journey with the taxi driver. '''If you do obtain a quote/negotiate an amount for the journey with the taxi driver, he/she is nonetheless legally obliged to turn on the taximeter''' - the reason for this is that if the final fare displayed on the meter (plus supplements) is lower than the fare which you were quoted/negotiated, '''you are only obliged to pay the lower amount''' and not the higher amount which you had previously agreed with the driver.\n\nStarting from 1 March 2016, if you take the taxi between Paris and Charles de Gaulle Airport/Orly Airport, the fare will not be calculated based on the distance/time using the meter, but will be instead be a '''fixed rate''' (''tarif forfaitaire''):\n* Between Charles de Gaulle Airport and Paris (Right Bank): 50\u20ac\n* Between Charles de Gaulle Airport and Paris (Left Bank): 55\u20ac\n* Between Orly Airport and Paris (Right Bank): 35\u20ac\n* Between Orly Airport and Paris (Left Bank): 30\u20ac\nFor more information, see the [http://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr/content/download/22927/164095/file/affichette%20information%20tarifs%20au%201er%20mars%202016.pdf information sheet provided by the Pr\u00e9fecture de police de Paris]. Note that the fixed rate is simply the maximum price which the taxi driver is legally permitted to charge; you are free to negotiate a lower rate with the taxi driver.\n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the service provided by the taxi driver, you should try to resolve any problems on the spot with him/her. If you are still dissatisfied, you can contact the taxi operator (unless the taxi driver is an independent driver). In Paris, you can contact the police which regulates taxis (<listing name=\"\" alt=\"\" address=\"Pr\u00e9fecture de police, Direction des transports et de la protection du public, Sous-direction des d\u00e9placements et de l\u2019espace public, Bureau des taxis et transports publics, 36 rue des Morillons, 75015 PARIS\" directions=\"\" phone=\"01 55 76 20 05\" email=\"prefpol.dtpp-sddep-bttp-taxis@interieur.gouv.fr\" fax=\"01 55 76 27 01\" url=\"http://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr/Demarches/Professionnel/Transports/Taxis-parisiens/Contact/Ecrivez-nous\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" tags=\"\"></listing> A complaint form in English is available at [http://www.prefecturedepolice.interieur.gouv.fr/content/download/13746/93292/file/Complaint%20form.pdf]).

In some ''depart\u00e9ments'', you can complain directly to the ''pr\u00e9fecture'' about a taxi under its jurisdiction.

In other ''depart\u00e9ments'', the prefect will have designated the consumer protection authority (Direction de la Protection des Populations) in the ''depart\u00e9ment'' as the body responsible for receiving complaints about taxi drivers. For a list of the relevant ''Direction de la Protection des Populations'', see [http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgccrf/coordonnees-des-DDPP-et-DDCSPP].

This is not necessarily linguistic snobbery, but is usually due to lack of practice, or fear that their little-used-since-high-school English will sound ridiculous. If you really must speak English, be sure to begin the conversation in French and ask if the person can speak English, as assuming someone can speak a foreign language is considered very rude. Please note that British English, spoken with the carefully articulated \"received pronunciation\", is what is generally taught in France; thus, other accents (such as Irish, Scottish, Southern US or Australian accents) may be understood with difficulty, if at all. Try to speak clearly and slowly, and avoid slang or US-specific words or phrases. There is no need to speak loudly (unless in a loud environment) to be understood; doing so is considered impolite. Don't forget that French people will really appreciate any attempts you do to speak French.}}\n'''French''' (''fran\u00e7ais'') is the official language of France, although there are regional variations in pronunciation and local words. For example, throughout France the word for yes, oui, said \"we\", but you will often hear the slang form \"ouais\", said \"waay.\" It's similar to the English language usage of \"Yeah\" instead of \"Yes\".\n\nIn [[Alsace]] and part of [[Lorraine]], a dialect of German called \"Alsatian\", which is almost incomprehensible to speakers of standard High German, is spoken. In the south, some still speak dialects of the ''Langue d'Oc'' (because the word for \"yes\" is ''oc''): Languedocien, Limousin, Auvergnat, or Proven\u00e7al. Langue d'Oc is a Romance language, a very close relative of Italian, Spanish, or Catalan. In the west part of Brittany, a few people, mainly old or scholars, speak Breton; this Celtic language is closer to Welsh than to French. In parts of [[Aquitaine]], [[Basque phrasebook|Basque]] is spoken, but not as much as on the Spanish side of the border. In Corsica a kind of Italian is spoken. In [[Provence]], [[Proven\u00e7al phrasebook|Proven\u00e7al]] is most likely to be spoken, especially along the Riviera.\n\nHowever, almost everyone speaks French and tourists are unlikely to ever come across regional languages, except in order to give a \"folkloric\" flair to things.\n\nHardly anybody understands imperial units such as gallons or Fahrenheit. Stick to metric units (after all, French invented this system!).\n\nThe French are generally attached to politeness (some might say excessively) and will react coolly to strangers that forget it. You might be surprised to see that you are greeted by other customers when you walk into a restaurant or shop.  Return the courtesy and address your hellos/goodbyes to everyone when you enter or leave small shops and cafes.  It is, for the French, very impolite to start a conversation with a stranger (even a shopkeeper or client) without at least a polite word like \"bonjour\". For this reason, starting the conversation with at least a few basic [[French phrasebook|French phrases]], or some equivalent polite form in English, goes a long way to convince them to try and help you.\n\n* \"Excusez-moi Monsieur/Madame\":  Excuse me (ex-COO-zay-mwah mih-SYOOR/muh-DAM)\n\n* \"S'il vous pla\u00eet Monsieur/Madame\" : Please (SEEL-voo-PLAY)\n\n* \"Merci Monsieur/Madame\" : Thank you (mare-SEE)\n\n* \"Au revoir Monsieur/Madame\" : Good Bye (Ore-vwar)\n\nAvoid \"Salut\" (Hi); it is reserved for friends and relatives, and to use it with people you are not acquainted with is considered quite impolite.\n\nSome travel phrases:\n\n* O\u00f9 est l'h\u00f4tel? - Where is the hotel?\n\n* O\u00f9 sont les toilettes? - Where can I find a restroom?\n\n* O\u00f9 est la gare? Where is the train station\n\n* Parlez-vous fran\u00e7ais? Do you speak French?\n\n* Parlez-vous anglais? Do you speak English?\n\nNote that French spoken with a hard English accent or an American accent can be very difficult for the average French person to understand.  In such circumstances, it may be best to write down what you are trying to say. But tales of waiters refusing to serve tourists because their pronunciation doesn't meet French standards are highly exaggerated. A good-faith effort will usually be appreciated, but don't be offended if a waiter responds to your fractured French, or even fluent but accented, in English (If you are a fluent French speaker and the waiter speaks to you in English when you'd prefer to speak French, continue to respond in French and the waiter will usually switch back - this is a common occurrence in the more tourist-orientated areas, especially in Paris).\n\nPlease note that some parts of France (such as [[Paris]]) are at times overrun by tourists. The locals there may have some blas\u00e9 feelings about helping for the umpteenth time foreign tourists who speak in an unintelligible language and ask for directions to the other side of the city. Be courteous and understanding.\n\nIf you will be in France for any length of time, it is advisable to learn more than just the basic phrases.  You will be much more favorably received if you are at least making the best effort you can.  The Paul Noble audio course is one of the fastest ways to get a 'fast and dirty' improvement to your French, within a few days.\n\nAs France is a very multicultural society, many African languages, Arabic, Chinese dialects, Vietnamese or Cambodian could be spoken. [[Spanish]], [[Italian]], [[Portuguese]] and even [[Romanian]] are comprehensible to a French speaker to a reasonably wide extent, as they are all mutually intelligible through most words and come from the same family tree, but you should stick to French unless you're in a large city.\n\nThe standard sign language in France is '''French Sign Language''', locally abbreviated '''LSF'''. Whenever an interpreter for the hearing-impaired is present at a public event, LSF will be used. Whether a user of a foreign sign language will be able to communicate in France depends on the user's specific language. For example, users of American Sign Language (also used in Anglophone Canada), Irish Sign Language, and Quebec Sign Language may be able to communicate to some degree. These languages are derived from LSF to a significant extent, and share a good deal of vocabulary and syntax. Languages in the LSF family also have one-handed manual alphabets that differ slightly from language to language. On the other hand, users of British Sign Language, New Zealand Sign Language, and Auslan will have great difficulty. These languages differ significantly in vocabulary and syntax from LSF, and also use the same two-handed manual alphabet.\n\nFinally, foreign TV programmes shown on local or national TV networks are dubbed into French.  Similarly, the audio of news interviews where the interviewee gives a response in another language is superimposed with a French translation.  For foreign films shown in a cinema however, audiences, particularly in larger cities, usually have an option to watch the film in its original language (with French subtitles) or whose audio is dubbed into French.\n\n==See==\nThinking of France, you might imagine the iconic '''Eiffel Tower''', the '''Arc de Triomphe''' or the famous smile of '''Mona Lisa'''. You might think of drinking coffee in the lively '''Paris caf\u00e9s''' where great intellectuals lingered in past times, or of eating croissants in a local bistro of a sleepy but gorgeous '''village''' in the countryside. Probably, images of splendid '''ch\u00e2teaux''' will spring to your mind, of '''lavender fields''' or perhaps of '''vineyards''' as far as the eye can see. Or perhaps, you'd envisage the chic resorts of the '''Cote D'Azur'''. And you wouldn't be wrong. However, they are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to France's many sights and attractions.\n\n===Cities===\n'''[[Paris]]'''. the \"City of Light\" and the capital of romance has been a travellers' magnet for centuries and a real must-see. Of course, no visit would be complete without a glance at its world famous landmarks. The Eiffel Tower is hard to miss, especially when it is lit beautifully at night, but the Arc de Triomphe, '''Notre Dame''' and '''Sacr\u00e9 Coeur''' are both famous and stunning sights too. With no less than '''3,800 national monuments''' in and around Paris, history is literally around every corner. Stroll through the city's spacious green parks, with the '''Luxembourg Gardens''' as one of the favourites, and make sure to spend some time on the famous banks of the '''river Seine'''. Also, don't miss the magnificent '''[[Versailles|Palace of Versailles]]''', the most grand reminder of the Ancient Regime located just 20km away from the capital.\n\n'''[[Bordeaux]]''' is famous for its wine but is also a bustling city with lots of historic sights to discover. It is listed as a World Heritage Site for being ''\"an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble\"''. '''[[Lyon]]''', the country's second largest city, is listed too, and boasts a beautiful '''old centre''' as well as a number of '''Roman ruins'''. '''[[Strasbourg]]''', one of the EU headquarters, has a character of its own, with clear [[Germany|German]] influences. '''[[Montpellier]]''' is one of the best places in the south, with lots of monumental buildings and nice caf\u00e9s. In the west there's the beautiful historic city of [[Nantes]], home to the '''Ch\u00e2teau des ducs de Bretagne''' and many other monuments. The '''Capitole de [[Toulouse]]''' is situated right at the heart that famous university city's street plan. Last but not least, don't overlook '''[[Arles]]''', with its World Heritage Listed '''Roman and Romanesque Monuments'''.\n\n===French Riviera===\nAnd then there are the magnificent cities of the '''[[C\u00f4te d'Azur]]''', once the place to be for the rich and famous but now equally popular with a general crowd. Its sandy beaches, beautiful bays, rocky cliffs and lovely towns has made it one of the main yachting and cruising areas in the world as well as popular destination for land-bound travellers. There's bustling '''[[Nice]]''', where some 4 million tourists a year enjoy the stony beaches and stroll over the '''Promenade des Anglais'''. '''[[Avignon]]''' with its splendid ramparts and '''Palais-des-Papes''' was once the seat of popes. Although '''[[Saint-Tropez]]''' gets overcrowded in summer, it's a delightful place in any other season. The same goes for '''[[Cannes]]''', where the jet-set of the film industry gathers each year for the famous '''Cannes Film Festival'''. From there, you can hop on a boat to the much more peaceful '''[[\u00celes de L\u00e9rins]]'''. \n\nMuch smaller in size but just as gorgeous (and popular) are the perched villages of '''[[Gourdon]]''' and '''[[\u00c8ze]]''', which is located on a 427 meter high cliff, much like an \u201ceagle's nest\u201d. Both offer some stunning panoramic views. From \u00c8ze, its a very short trip to the glitter and glamour of '''[[Monaco]]'''. For the world's millionaires and aristocracy, the green peninsula of '''[[Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat]]''' is an old time favourite with the impressive '''Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild''' full of impressionist art as its main sight. A bit more inland but well-worth a visit are the towns of '''[[Grasse]]''', famous for its '''perfumeries''', and '''[[Biot]]''', known for its glass blowers. The huge city and arts-hub '''[[Marseille]]''' is usually not considered part of the Cote D'Azur, but is very close. It has plenty of historic sights and nearby are the stunning '''Calanques''', a series of miniature fjords it shares with [[Cassis]].\n\n===Countryside & villages===\nYou haven't seen the best of France if you haven't had at least a taste of its amazing countryside, dotted with wonderful '''medieval villages and castles'''. There are great examples in any part of the country, but some [http://www.les-plus-beaux-villages-de-france.org/en 156 have been identified as the most beautiful villages] in France . The country's landscapes vary from the snow-covered peaks of the '''[[Alps]]''' and the '''[[Pyrenees]]''' with their many winter sports resorts to lush river valleys, dense forests and huge stretches of farmland and vineyards. The '''[[Provence]]''', backing a good part of the C\u00f4te d'Azur, is one of the most beloved regions. It has a typical Mediterranean atmosphere and is famous for its lavender fields and ros\u00e9 wines. It's also home to the stunning '''[[Verdon Gorge]]''', one of the most beautiful gorges in [[Europe]]. The rolling riverine landscape of the '''[[Loire Valley]]''' is home to many great castles, of which [[Amboise|Ch\u00e2teaux Amboise]], [[Ch\u00e2teau de Villandry]], [[Azay-le-Rideau]], [[Chambord]] and [[Ch\u00e2teaux du Pin]] are some of the finest examples. The western region of '''[[Brittany]]''' reaches far into the Atlantic and boasts many '''megalith monuments''' such as those near [[Carnac]]. The beaches of '''[[Normandy]]''', also on the Atlantic coast, are famed for the D-Day Allied invasion on 6 June 1944. Although the humbling '''Normandy American Cemetery''' and countless museums, memorials and war time remains keep memory of those dark days alive, the region is now a pleasant and popular destination. Its picturesque coast line includes both long stretches of beach and steep limestone cliffs, such as those near [[\u00c9tretat]]). The region is also home to the splendid and World Heritage listed '''[[Mont-Saint-Michel]] and its Bay'''. The lush hills of the '''[[Dordogne]]''' form another region famous for its '''castles''', with over 1500 of them on its 9000km\u00b2 area.\n\n===Art museums===\nAs the French have a real taste for art, the country has numerous art galleries and museums. Several of them are widely considered to be among the finest museums in the world of art, art-history, and culture. The grandeur and fame of the '''Mus\u00e9e du Louvre''' in [[Paris]] can hardly be matched by any other museum in the world. It boasts a fabulous collection of art from antiquity to the 19th century and is home of the Mona Lisa and many other renowned works. At just a 15 minute walk from there is the '''Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay''', another world class museum that picks up roughly where the Louvre's collections ends. It's located in an old railway station and houses the national collection of art works from the 1848 to 1914 period. Its excellent collection includes some of the best French Impressionist, post-Impressionist and Art Nouveau works, including Degas' ballerinas and Monet's waterlillies. The '''Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne''' in '''Centre Pompidou''', still in France's capital, is the largest museum for modern art in Europe. The '''Museum of Fine Arts''' in [[Lyon]] has an excellent collection varying from ancient Egypt antiquities to Modern art paintings and sculptures. In [[Lille]] you'll find the '''Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille''', one of the country's largest museums. Its varied collection is second in size after the Louvre and boasts anything from antiquities to modern art. Smaller but still outstanding are the collections of the '''Mus\u00e9e Fabre''' in [[Montpellier]], '''Mus\u00e9e Toulouse-Lautrec''' in [[Albi]] and the '''Picasso Museum''' in Paris. [[Marseille]] has many galleries and its '''Mus\u00e9e Cantini''' has a good collection of modern art associated with Marseille as well as several works by Picasso. '''Fondation Maeght''' houses modern art too and is situated in [[Saint-Paul de Vence]].\n\n===Parks & natural attractions===\n'''[[Disneyland Resort Paris]]''' is by far France's most popular park, visited by families from all over Europe. The country's national parks have quite some visitors too though, due to their splendid scenery and great opportunities for outdoor sports. '''[[Vanoise National Park]]''' is the oldest and one of the largest parks, named after the Vanoise massif. Its highest peak is the '''Grande Casse''' at 3,855 m. The impressive natural landscapes of '''[[Parc national des Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]]''' are right on the southern border of France and extend well into [[Spain]], where they are part of the '''Parc National Ordesa y Monte Perdido''' The whole area is listed as UNESCO World Heritage. In the French part, the glacial '''cirques of Gavarnie, Estaub\u00e9 and Troumouse''' are some of the best sights, as is the '''wall of Barroud'''. The again mountainous '''C\u00e9vennes National Park''' covers parts of the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] (including te popular '''[[Ard\u00e8che]]'''), [[Midi-Pyrenees|Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es]] and the [[Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes]] regions. Its headquarters is in the castle of [[Florac]], but there are towns all over the park. Donkey rides are available and the '''Cave formation of Aven Armand''' is one of the parks' best sights.\n\nNot yet under a protective status but highly popular is '''[[Mont Blanc]]''', the highest peak in Europe and attractive for climbing, hiking and skiing. From the French side, it is mostly explored from '''[[Chamonix]]''', a well known resort on the foot of the mountain.\n\n==Do==\n*Go to the top of the '''Eiffel Tower''' in [[Paris]]\n\n*Stroll grand Parisian Boulevards\n\n*Climb '''Montmartre''' Hill in [[Paris]]\n\n*See a managable amount of art in the Louvre, or see the art in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay (Orsay Museum), in a former train station\n\n*See the modern architecture in the business district of [[Paris/La Defense|La Defense]]\n\n*See the Science Museum in Villette Park, and the other odd attractions assembled there\n\n*Stroll an old train viaduct on the Promenade Plantee in [[Paris]]\n\n*See the stunning, but crowded, [[Versailles|Versailles Palace]]\n\n*Ride the '''TGV''', one of the fastest trains in the world, from [[Paris]] to [[Lyon]]\n\n*See the \"[[D-Day beaches]]\" of [[Normandy]]\n\n*Cross the beach at low tide and then climb to the top of [[Mont Saint Michel]]\n\n*Explore [[Chartres]] Cathedral\n\n*See the quaintness of the [[Alsace]]\n\n*Sunbathe on the beaches of the [[French Riviera]]\n\n*Ride a bike along a section of Tour De France\n\n*Go to [[Camargue]]-a large beautiful river that occasionally turns red\n\n*Walk through the memorial of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]]\n\n==Buy==\n===Vacations===\nMany of the French take their vacations in August. As a result, outside of touristic areas, many of the smaller stores (butcher shops, bakeries...) will be closed in parts of August. This also applies to many corporations as well as physicians. Obviously, in touristy areas, stores will tend to be open when the tourists come, especially July and August. In contrast, many attractions will be awfully crowded during those months, and during Easter week-end.\n\nSome attractions, especially in rural areas, close or have reduced opening hours outside the touristic season.\n\nMountain areas tend to have two touristic seasons: in the winter, for skiing, snowshoeing and other snow-related activities, and in the summer for sightseeing and hiking.\n\n===Money===\n{{Euro}}\n\nSome foreign currencies such as the US dollar and the British Pound are occasionally accepted, especially in touristic areas and in higher-end places, but one should not count on it; furthermore, the merchant may apply some unfavourable rate. In general, shops will refuse transactions in foreign currency.\n\nIt is compulsory, for the large majority of businesses, to post prices in windows. Hotels and restaurants must have their rates visible from outside (note, however, that many hotels propose lower prices than the posted ones if they feel they will have a hard time filling up their rooms; the posted price is only a maximum).\n\nAlmost all stores, restaurants and hotels take the CB French debit card, and its foreign affiliations, Visa and Mastercard. American Express tends to be accepted only in high-end shops. Check with your bank for applicable fees (typically, banks apply the wholesale inter-bank exchange rate, which is the best available, but may slap a proportional and/or a fixed fee).  If ever the merchant requires a minimum amount before purchasing, then they will post it in writing at the till or the shop's entrance.  \n\nFrench CB cards (and CB/Visa and CB/Mastercard cards) have a \"smart chip\" on them allowing PIN authentication of transactions. This system, initiated in France, has now evolved to an international standard and newer British cards are compatible. Some automatic retail machines (such as those vending tickets) may be compatible only with cards with the microchip. In addition, cashiers unaccustomed to foreign cards possibly do not know that foreign Visa or Mastercard cards have to be swiped and a signature obtained, while French customers systematically use PIN and don't sign the transactions.\n\nThere is (practically) no way to get a cash advance from a credit card without a PIN in France.\n\nAutomatic teller machines (ATM) are by far the best way to get money in France. They all take CB, Visa, Mastercard, Cirrus and Plus and are plentiful throughout France. They may accept other kinds of card; check for the logos on the ATM and on your card (on the back, generally) if at least one matches. It is possible that some machines do not handle 6-digit PIN codes (only 4-digit ones), or that they do not offer the choice between different accounts (defaulting on the checking account). Check with your bank about applicable fees, which may vary greatly (typically, banks apply the wholesale inter-bank exchange rate, which is the best available, but may slap a proportional and/or a fixed fee; because of the fixed fee it is generally better to withdraw money in big chunks rather than \u20ac20 at a time). Also, check about applicable maximal withdrawal limits.\n\nTraveller's cheques are difficult to use &mdash; most merchants will not accept them, and exchanging them may involve finding a bank that accepts to exchange them and possibly paying a fee.\n\nNote that the postal service doubles as a bank, so often post offices will have an ATM. As a result, even minor towns will have ATMs usable with foreign cards.\n\nExchange offices (''bureaux de change'') are now rarer with the advent of the Euro - they will in general only be found in towns with a significant foreign tourist presence, such as Paris. Some banks exchange money, often with high fees. The Bank of France no longer does foreign exchange.\n\n'''Do's''' Put money into your checking account, carry an ATM card with a Cirrus or Plus logo on it and a 4-digit pin that does not start with '0' and withdraw cash from ATMs. Pay larger transactions (hotel, restaurants...) with Visa or Mastercard. Always carry some \u20ac cash for emergencies.\n\n'''Don't's''' Carry foreign currency (USD, GBP...) or traveller's cheques, and exchange them on the go, or expect them to be accepted by shops.\n\n===Stores===\nInside city centres, you will find smaller stores, chain grocery stores (''Monoprix'', ''Carrefour City'') as well as, occasionally, department stores and small shopping malls. Residential areas will often have small supermarkets (''Auchan'', ''Intermarch\u00e9''). Large supermarkets (''hypermarch\u00e9s'' such as ''E. Leclerc'' or ''Carrefour'') are mostly located on the outskirts of towns and are probably not useful unless you have a car.\n\nPrices are indicated with all taxes (namely, the TVA, or value-added tax) included. It is possible for non-EU residents aged 16 or over spending less than 6 months in France to get a partial refund of TVA upon departure from the EU when shopping at certain stores that have a \"tax-free shopping\" sticker (in French, 'la d\u00e9taxe'); inquire within. A refund of TVA is only possible in you spend over \u20ac175 (inclusive of TVA) from a single shop in one day. TVA is 20.0% (as of January 2014) on most merchandise, but 10.0% on some things such as books, restaurant meals, and public transport and 5.0% on food purchased from grocery stores (except for sweets and candies!). Alcoholic beverages are always taxed at 20%, regardless of where they're purchased. For more information, see this [http://www.douane.gouv.fr/Portals/0/fichiers/particulier/voyage/detaxe-pablo-%28en%29-vat-refund-process-in-france.pdf French Customs webpage].\n\nAlways keep your receipt after purchasing an item in a shop, because if it turns out to be defective, you have the right to return it and get a refund/exchange.\n\nStarting from 1 January 2015, shops in France will only be allowed to run sales for a maximum of 10 weeks per year (in 2015, the legal winter sales period runs between Wednesday 7 January and Tuesday 17 February and the summer sales period between Wednesday 24 June and Tuesday 4 August - outside these two periods, sales are forbidden, but shops are allowed to sell their products at reduced prices). For more information, see this [http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgccrf/Publications/Vie-pratique/Fiches-pratiques/Soldes French Government webpage].\n\nAlthough it is not common to bargain/haggle on prices, especially in bigger/chain stores, more and more French people are starting to negotiate prices and ask for discounts when considering making a purchase, particularly in markets and in smaller, independent shops (in 2008, over half of French people admitted in a survey to negotiating prices). You are more likely to be successful if you smile when you bargain, purchase several products, and compare the price with that offered in other shops.\n\nIf you are still satisfied with the product which you purchased or the service you received in a shop, you should first try to resolve the problem with the shop staff/manager. If you are still dissatisfied, you can contact the responsible consumer protection authority if the shop has violated the law (e.g. it sold you a product at a higher price to the one advertised, it refused to refund/exchange a defective product, it gave you an inferior level of service on the basis of your race/sex/religion/beliefs/disability/family situation). In Paris, the relevant authority is the Direction d\u00e9partementale de la protection des populations (DDPP) (<listing name=\"\" alt=\"\" address=\"8 rue Froissart, 75153 PARIS Cedex 03\" directions=\"\" phone=\"01 40 27 16 00\" email=\"ddpp@paris.gouv.fr\" fax=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" tags=\"\"></listing>). Outside Paris, you can find a list of consumer protection authorities by ''d\u00e9partement'' at [http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgccrf/coordonnees-des-DDPP-et-DDCSPP].\n\n===Internet===\nDon't forget about the internet. There are various solutions available on the market. The best are eSim based connectivity hubs, such as Nommi. It provides internet in over150 countries at a nearly local price and gives free access to over 4 million Wi-Fi networks around the world which are available via Nommi App as a Wi-Fi map. Additionally, the device functions as a power bank, able to charge a smartphone a few times. Nommi also has a built-in VPN that works in China.\n\n==Eat==\n[[File:Woodsoup.jpg|thumb|250px|Onion soup]]\nWith its international reputation for fine dining, few people would be surprised to hear that French cuisine can certainly be very good.  Unfortunately, it can also be quite disappointing; many restaurants serve very ordinary fare, and some in touristy areas are rip-offs.  Finding the right restaurant is therefore very important - try asking locals, hotel staff or even browsing restaurant guides for recommendations as simply walking in off the street can be a hit and miss affair.  \n\nThere are many places to try French food in France, from three-star Michelin restaurants to French \"brasseries\" or \"bistros\" that you can find at almost every corner, especially in big cities.  These usually offer a relatively consistent and virtually standardised menu of relatively inexpensive cuisine.  To obtain a greater variety of dishes, a larger outlay of money is often necessary.  In general, one should try to eat where the locals do for the best chance of a memorable meal.  Most small cities or even villages have local restaurants which are sometimes listed in the most reliable guides. There are also specific local restaurants, like \"bouchons lyonnais\" in Lyon, \"cr\u00eaperies\" in Brittany (or in the Montparnasse area of Paris), etc.\n\nChinese, Vietnamese, even Thai eateries are readily available in Paris, either as regular restaurants or \"traiteurs\" (fast-food). They are not so common, and are more expensive, in smaller French cities. Many places have \"Italian\" restaurants though these are often little more than unimaginative pizza and pasta parlors. You will also find North African (Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian) as well as Greek and Lebanese food. The ubiquitous hamburger eateries (US original or their French copies) are also available; note that McDonalds is more upmarket in France than in the US.\n\nIn France, taxes (10 per cent of the total in restaurants) and service (usually 15 per cent) are always included in the bill (the menu/bill will state 'prix service compris'), so anything patrons add to the bill amount is an \"extra-tip\" ('pourboire'). French people usually leave one or two coins if they are happy with the service.\n\nFixed price menus seldom include beverages (if drinks are included, the menu will state 'boisson comprise'). If you want water, waiters will often try to sell you still mineral water (\u00c9vian, Thonon) or sparkling water (Badoit, Perrier), at a premium; ask for a ''carafe d'eau'' (bottle of tap water), which is safe to drink (and, by law, must be provided free of charge when you order food at a restaurant). Water ''never'' comes with ice in it unless so requested (and water with ice may not be available).\n\nAs in other countries, restaurants tend to make a large profit off beverages. Expect wine to cost much more than it would in a supermarket. Some restaurants allow you to bring your own bottle of wine to drink with a corkage/BYOB fee (''droit de bouchon'').\n\nYou can order either from a fixed price menu (''prix fixe'') or ''\u00e0 la carte''. Many restaurants/eateries also offer a cheaper lunchtime fixed price menu (''menu du midi'' or ''menu du jour'').\n\nA typical fixed price menu will comprise:\n\n* appetizer, called ''entr\u00e9es'' or ''hors d'\u0153uvres''\n* main dish, called ''plat''\n* dessert (''dessert'') or cheese (''fromage'')\n\nSometimes, restaurants offer the option to take only two of the three courses, at a reduced price.\n\nWhen you order food at a restaurant, by law the price includes bread ('du pain'). Feel free to ask for more bread if you want.\n\nIf you order a steak/piece of meat (such as liver), you may be asked how you want it cooked ('Quelle cuisson?'):\n* very rare/blue rare (''bleu'')\n* rare (''saignant'')\n* medium (''\u00e0 point'')\n* well done (''bien cuit'')\n* very well done (''tr\u00e8s bien cuit'')\n\nCoffee is always served as a final step (though it may be followed by liquors). A request for coffee during the meal will be considered strange.\n\nNot all restaurants are open for lunch and dinner, nor are they open all year around. It is therefore advisable to check carefully the opening times and days. A restaurant open for lunch will usually start service at noon and accept patrons until 13:30. Dinner begins at around 19:30 and patrons are accepted until 21:30. Restaurants with longer service hours are usually found only in the larger cities and in the downtown area. Finding a restaurant open on Saturday and especially Sunday can be a challenge unless you stay close to the tourist areas. \n\nIn a reasonable number of restaurants, especially outside tourist areas, booking a table is compulsory and people may be turned away without one, even if the restaurant is clearly not filled to capacity.  For this reason, it can be worthwhile to research potential eateries in advance and make the necessary reservations to avoid disappointment, especially if the restaurant you're considering is specially advised in guide books.\n\nIt is illegal for a restaurant to turn you away unless there is an objectively justifiable and legitimate reason (for example, the restaurant is about to close, or you are clearly inebriated). The restaurant must not turn you away simply because you have children with you, or because you are alone/in a small group and the only table left can sit more people. The restaurant is permitted to turn you away if you have a pet animal with you (unless it is a guide dog). If the restaurant turns you away without a legitimate reason, the restaurateur will be liable for a minimum fine of \u20ac1500. If the restaurant turns you away based on your race, family situation (e.g. you have brought your children with you), disability, religion and/or beliefs/opinions, the restaurateur will be liable for a fine of \u20ac30000 and a 2 year prison sentence. If you are the victim of illegal treatment by a restaurant, you should report the incident to the responsible consumer protection authority (see below).\n\nIf you are a patron at a restaurant, by law the restaurant cannot charge you to use the toilet.\n\nA lunch or dinner for two on the \"menu\" including wine and coffee will cost you (as of 2004) \u20ac70 to \u20ac100 in a listed restaurant in Paris. The same with beer in a local \"bistro\" or a \"cr\u00eaperie\" around \u20ac50. A lunch or dinner for one person in a decent Chinese restaurant in Paris can cost as little as \u20ac8 if one looks carefully.\n\nOutside of Paris and the main cities, prices are not always lower but the menu will include a fourth course, usually cheese. As everywhere beware of the tourist traps which are numerous around the heavy travelled spots and may offer a nice view but not much to remember in your plate. \n\nIf you are dissatisfied with the food and/or service you receive at a restaurant, you should speak to the waiter/manager. By law, the restaurant is obliged to provide a new plate of food if the one which has been served to you is not fresh, sufficiently hot, or inconsistent with the menu description. (However, if the plate served is merely not to your taste, the restaurant is not legally obliged to provide a new plate of food, and you are still obliged to pay for what you have ordered even if you do not consume it.) If you are still dissatisfied with the food/service, you can complain to the responsible consumer protection authority. In Paris, the relevant authority is the Direction d\u00e9partementale de la protection des populations (DDPP) (<listing name=\"\" alt=\"\" address=\"8 rue Froissart, 75153 PARIS Cedex 03\" directions=\"\" phone=\"01 40 27 16 00\" email=\"ddpp@paris.gouv.fr\" fax=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" tags=\"\"></listing>). Outside Paris, you can find a list of consumer protection authorities by ''d\u00e9partement'' at [http://www.economie.gouv.fr/dgccrf/coordonnees-des-DDPP-et-DDCSPP]. If, following your meal at a restaurant, you become unwell and suspect that it was because of the poor hygiene conditions at the restaurant, you should alert the relevant health protection authorities as soon as possible: in Paris, the consumer protection authority (DDPP) also acts as the regulator of hygiene conditions at restaurants, but outside Paris, it is the Direction r\u00e9gionale de l'Alimentation, de l'Agriculture et de la For\u00eat (DRAAF) which is responsible for monitoring hygiene conditions at restaurants (contact details by region can be found at [http://agriculture.gouv.fr/services-deconcentres]).\n\n===Bread===\n\nAll white bread variants keep for only a short time and must be eaten the same day.  Hence bakers bake at least twice a day.\n\n*The famous '''baguette''': a long, thin loaf\n\n*'''Baguette de tradition fran\u00e7aise''': made from wheat flour, water, yeast and salt (not frozen dough), and may also contain broad bean flour (max 2%), soya flour (max 0.5%) and/or wheat malt flour (max 0.3%); by law, it must be prepared and baked in the same place where it is sold (usually sold for \u20ac1 to \u20ac1.20) - arguably the best type of baguette\n\n*Variants of the baguette : la ficelle (even thinner), la fl\u00fbte\n\n*''Pain de campagne'' or ''Pain complet'': made from whole grain which keeps relatively well.\n\n*''Boule'': round loaf\n\n===Pastries===\n\nPastries are a large part of French cooking. Hotel breakfasts tend to be light, consisting of ''tartines'' (pieces of bread with butter or jam) or the famous ''croissants'' and ''pain au chocolat''/\"chocolatine\", not dissimilar to a  chocolate filled croissant (but square rather than crescent shaped).\n\nPastries can be found in a ''p\u00e2tisserie'' but also in most boulangeries. Within the culture of French pastries, we can also find traditional ''macarons'', the most coveted cookie in France, particularly in Paris but born in Italy in 1533. Originated were simple cookies, made of almond powder, sugar and egg whites, now you can find them in almost all the bakeries in France as a \u201cdouble-decker\u201d affair with different kinds of cream flavors inside that stick two cookies together.\n\n===Regional dishes===\n\nEvery French region has dishes all its own. These dishes follow the resources (game, fish, agriculture, etc) of the region, the vegetables (cabbage, turnip, endives, etc) which they grow there. Here is a small list of regional dishes which you can find easily in France. Generally each region has a unique and widespread dish (usually because it was poor people's food):\n\n*'''Cassoulet''' (in south west) : Beans, duck, pork &amp; sausages\n\n*'''Choucroute''', or sauerkraut (in Alsace) : stripped fermented cabbage + pork\n\n*'''Flammekueche''' (Alsace) : thin-crust pizza with cheese, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, onions and bacon\n\n*'''Baeckeoffe''' (Alsace) : sliced potatoes, sliced onions, cubed mutton, beef and pork stew\n\n*'''Quiche Lorraine''' (Lorraine) : pie with custard, bacon and cheese\n\n*'''Fondue Savoyarde''' (central Alps) : Melted/hot cheese with alcohol\n\n*'''Fondue Bourguignonne''' (in Burgundy) : Pieces of beef (in boiled oil), usually served with a selection of various sauces.\n\n*'''Raclette''' (central Alps) : melted cheese & potatoes/meat\n\n*'''Pot-au-feu''' : boiled beef with vegetables\n\n*'''Tournedos Rossini''' : beef tenderloin pan-fried in butter, topped with a slice of pan-fried foie gras, garnished with slices of black truffle and finished in a rich Madeira sauce\n\n*'''Boeuf Bourguignon''' (Burgundy) : slow cooked beef with gravy\n\n*'''Navarin d'agneau''' : lamb version of boeuf bourguignon\n\n*'''Coq au vin''' : chicken stew with wine, lardons and mushrooms\n\n*'''Gratin dauphinois''' (Rhone-Alpes) : oven roasted slices of potatoes\n\n*'''Aligot''' (Auvergne) : melted cheese mixed with a puree of potatoes\n\n*'''Bouillabaisse''' (fish + saffron) (Marseille and French Riviera) : Don't be fooled. A real bouillabaisse is a really expensive dish due to the amount of fresh fish it requires. Be prepared to pay at least \u20ac30/persons. If you find restaurants claiming serving bouillabaisse for something like \u20ac15/persons, you'll get a very poor quality.\n\n*'''Soupe de poisson \u00e0 la rouille''' (Marseille and French Riviera) : tomato and saffron fish soup, served with 'rouille' (saffron mayonnaise)\n\n*'''Pissaladi\u00e8re''' (French Riviera) : pizza with onion, olives and anchovies\n\n*'''Soupe au pistou''' (French Riviera) : soup with pesto\n\n*'''Ratatouille''' (Provence) : vegetable stew (tomatoes, onion, courgettes, aubergines, peppers)\n\n*'''Gigot D\u2019Agneau Pleureur''' (Provence) : leg of lamb cooked slowly on top of potatoes\n\n*'''Tartiflette''' (Savoie) Reblochon cheese, potatoes and pork or bacon.\n\n*'''Confit de Canard''' (Landes) : Duck Confit, consists of legs and wings bathing in grease. That grease is actually very healthy and, with red wine, is one of the identified sources of the so-called \"French Paradox\" (eat richly, live long).\n\n*'''Foie Gras''' (Landes) : The liver of a duck or goose. Although usually quite expensive, foie gras can be found in supermarkets for a lower price (because of their purchasing power) around the holiday season. It is the time of year when most of foie gras is consumed in France. It goes very well with Champagne.\n\n*'''Magret de canard''' : Pan-fried duck breast\n\n*'''Confit de canard''' : Duck leg which is cured in salt and then cooked in its own fat\n\n*'''Garbure''' (Aquitaine) : Soup/stew of ham and cabbage\n\n*'''Quenelle de brochet''' (Lyon) : Pike fish combined with breadcrumbs and a light egg binding, served in an oval shape\n\n*'''Piperade''' (Basque country) : Stew made of tomatoes, onions and peppers with some eggs on top\n\n*'''Poulet basquaise''' (Basque country) : Stew made of chicken, tomatoes, onions and peppers\n\n*'''Accras de morue''' (Guadeloupe and Martinique) : deep-fried balls of cod\n \nCooking and drinking is a notable part of the French culture, take time to eat and discover new dishes...\n\n===Unusual foods===\n[[File:Escargots 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|if you are served ''escargots'' or snails, you will usually also get a slim and specialised fork to eat them with.]]\nContrary to stereotype, snails and frog legs are quite infrequent foods in France, with many French people enjoying neither, or sometimes never having even tasted them. Quality restaurants sometimes have them on their menu: if you're curious about trying new foods, go ahead.\n*'''Frogs' legs''' have a very fine and delicate taste with flesh that is not unlike chicken. They are often served in a garlic dressing and are no weirder to eat than, say, crab. \n*Most of the taste of '''Bourgogne snails''' (''escargots de bourgogne'') comes from the generous amount of butter, garlic and parsley in which they are cooked. They have a very particular spongy-leathery texture that is the characteristic that is liked by people who like snails. Catalan style snails (\"cargols\") are made a completely different way, and taste much weirder.\n\nLet us also cite:\n* '''Rillettes sarthoises''' also known as Rillettes du Mans.  A sort of potted meat, made from finely shredded and spiced pork. A delicious speciality of the Sarthe area in the north of the Pays de la Loire and not to be confused with rillettes from other areas, which are more like a rough pate.\n* '''Beef bone marrow''' (os \u00e0 moelle). Generally served in small quantities, with a large side. So go ahead: If you don't like it, you'll have something else to eat in your plate.\n* '''Veal sweetbread''' (ris de Veau), is a very fine (and generally expensive) delicacy, often served with morels, or in more elaborates dishes like \"bouchees a la reine\".\n* '''Beef bowels''' (''tripes'') is served either \"A la mode de Caen\" (with a white wine sauce, named after the town in Normandy) or \"A la catalane\" (with a slightly spiced tomato sauce)\n* '''Blood sausage''' (''boudin noir'') often served with potatoes and apples\n* '''Andouillettes''' are sausages made from tripe, a speciality of Lyon\n* '''Tricandilles''' are seasoned and grilled pork tripe from the Bordeaux region\n* '''Beef tongue''' (''langue de b\u0153uf'') and '''beef nose'''(museau) and  Veal head (t\u00eate de veau) are generally eaten cold (but thoroughly cooked!) as an appetizer.\n* '''Canard \u00e0 la presse''' (pressed duck) the duck is asphyxiated to retain the blood, the meat is then roasted and the carcass is put through a press to extract the blood and juices. The extract is thickened and flavoured with butter, cognac and duck liver, and the sauce is then served on pan-fried duck breast.\n* '''Lamprey \u00e0 la Bordelaise''' lamprey fish cooked in a stew with leeks, red wine, onions and ham\n* '''Oysters''' (Hu\u00eetres) are most commonly served raw in a half shell. They are often graded by size, No1 being the largest (and most expensive).\n* '''Oursins''' (sea urchins) For those who like concentrated iodine.\n* '''Steak tartare''' a big patty of ground beef cured in acid as opposed to cooked, frequently served with a raw egg. Good steak tartare will be prepared to order at your table. A similar dish is '''boeuf carpaccio''', which is thin slices or strips of raw steak drizzled with olive oil and herbs. \n* '''Cervelle''' (pronounced ser-VELL), lamb brain.\n\n===Cheese===\nFrance is certainly THE country of cheese, with nearly 400 different kinds. Indeed, former president General Charles De Gaulle was quoted as saying \"How can you govern a country which has 365 varieties of cheese?\".\n\nHere is a far from exhaustive list of what one can find:\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\"\n|-\n| Bleu des Causses || Livarot || Roquefort\n|-\n| Bleu du Vercors || Morbier || Saint Nectaire \n|-\n| Boulette d'Avesnes || Maroilles || Salers\n|-\n| Brie de Meaux || Munster || Sainte Maure de Touraine\n|-\n| Brie de Melun || Murol || Selles-sur-Cher\n|-\n| Broccio || Neufch\u00e2tel || Saint Marcellin\n|-\n| Camembert || Ossau-Iraty || Sainte Maure de Touraine\n|-\n| Cantal || Pelardon || Tomme de ch\u00e8vre\n|-\n| Chaource || P\u00e9rail || Tomme des C\u00e9vennes\n|-\n| Comt\u00e9 || Picodon  ||Valen\u00e7ay\n|-\n| ... ||\n|-\n|}\n\n===Dietary restrictions===\nVegetarianism is more common than it used to be, especially in larger cities. Still, very few restaurants offer vegetarian menus, thus if you ask for something vegetarian the only things they may have available are salad and vegetable side dishes.\n\nThere may still be confusions between vegetarianism and pesce/pollotarianism. Vegetarian/organic food restaurants are starting to appear. However, \"traditional\" French restaurants may not have anything vegetarian on the menu, so you may have to pick something \"\u00e0 la carte\", which is usually more expensive.\nVeganism is still very uncommon and it may be difficult to find vegan eateries.\n\n===Breakfast===\nBreakfast in France isn't the most important meal of the day and is usually very light. The most typical breakfast consists of a coffee and a croissant or some other \"viennoiserie\" (pastry), but since it implies going to the patisserie early in the morning to buy a fresh croissant, it's typically reserved for somewhat special occasions. On normal days most people have a drink (coffee, tea, hot chocolate, orange juice) and either toast (\"tartines\" made of baguette or toast bread with butter and jam/honey/Nutella) that can be dipped in the hot drink, or cereal with milk. People who eat healthy may go for fruits and yoghurt. As a general rule, the French breakfast is mostly sweet, but everything changes and an increasing number of places are starting to serve savoury breakfasts.\n\n==Drink==\nChampagne, Burgundy, Bordeaux, Rhone, the Loire Valley... France is the home of wine.\n\nBeer (lager) is also extremely popular, in particular in northern France, where \"[[Biere de Garde]]\" can be found. \n\nThe alcohol ''purchase'' age was recently raised to '''18''' for all drinks, but this is not always strictly enforced; however, laws against drunk driving are strictly enforced, with stiff penalties.\n\nWine and liquors may be purchased from supermarkets, or from specialized stores such as the Nicolas chain. Nicolas offers good advice on what to buy (specify the kind of wine and the price range you desire). In general, only French wines are available unless a foreign wine is a \"speciality\" with no equivalent in France (such as port), and they are classified by region of origin, not by grape.\n\nPrices of food and beverages will vary according to whether they're served to you at the bar or sitting at a table - the same cup of espresso might cost \u20ac0.50 more if served at a table than at the bar, and \u20ac0.50 more again if served out on the terrace. Really, you're not paying so much for the beverage as for the table spot. Do consider the bar, though - while you will have to stand, caf\u00e9 bars are often where a great deal of public discourse and interaction happens. In any event, caf\u00e9s are required by law to post their prices somewhere in the establishment, usually either in the window or on the wall by the bar. Note also that caf\u00e9s in touristy areas, especially in Paris, tend to serve very expensive food of rather average quality. Unless you are dying of hunger or thirst, avoid the places that have menus in multiple languages or are near heavily-trafficked attractions. Instead, consider buying snacks and beverages from a grocery store and enjoying them in a nearby park.\n\nThere are a couple of mixed drinks which seem to be more or less unique to France, and nearby francophone countries.\n*'''Panach\u00e9''' is a mix of beer and lemonade, basically a beer shandy. (Same as \"Radler\" in Central Europe.)\n*'''Monaco''' is a Panach\u00e9 with some grenadine syrup added.\n*'''Kir''' is a pleasant aperitif of white wine (in theory, ''Bourgogne Aligot\u00e9'') or, less frequently, of champagne (then named ''kir royal'' and about twice the price of regular kir) and cassis (blackcurrant liqueur), or peche (peach), or ''m\u00fbre'' (blackberry).\n*'''Pastis''' is an anise-based (licorice-flavoured) spirit, similar in taste to Sambuca or Ouzo, that is served with a few lumps of sugar and a small pitcher of cold water to dilute the liquor.  It is traditionally enjoyed on very hot days, and as such is more popular in the south of the country but available more or less everywhere.\n\nThere is a variety of bottled water, including:\n* \u00c9vian, Thonon, Contrex, Volvic: mineral water\n* Perrier: fizzy water\n* Badoit: slightly fizzy and salty water.\n\n==Sleep==\n\n===Short term rentals===\nTravellers should definitely consider short term villa/apartment/studio rentals as an alternative to other accommodations options.  Short term can be as few as several days up to months at a stretch.  Summer rentals are usually from Saturday to Saturday only (July & August). This type accommodation belongs to a private party, and can range from basic to luxurious.  A particular advantage, aside from competitive prices, is that the accommodations come with fully fitted kitchens. \n\nHundreds of agencies offer accommodation for short term rentals on behalf of the owner, and can guide you into finding the best property, at the best price in the most suitable location for you. An internet search for the location and type of property you're looking for will usually return the names of several listing sites, each of which may have hundreds or thousands of properties for you to choose from. There are plenty of sites in both English and French, and the rental properties may be owned by people of any nationality. \n\nFrance is a diverse and colourful country, and you'll find everything from stunning log chalets in the Alps, Chateaux in the countryside and beach front villas on the Riviera...plus everything in between!\n\n===Hotels===\nHotels come in 5 categories from 1 to 5 stars. This is the official rating given by the Ministry of Tourism, and it is posted at the entrance on a blue shield. Stars are awarded according to objective yet somewhat outdated administrative criteria (area of the reception hall, percentage of rooms with en suite bathroom...).\n\nRates vary according to accommodation, location and sometimes high or low season or special events.\n\nAs of 2004, the rate for a *** hotel listed in a reliable guidebook falls between \u20ac70 (cheap) and \u20ac110 (expensive) for a double without breakfast.\n\nAll hotels, by law, must have their rates posted outside (or visible from outside). Note that these are maximal rates: a hotel can always propose a lower rate in order to fill up its rooms. Bargaining is not the norm but you can always ask for a discount.\n\nHotels located in city centres or near train stations are often very small (15-30 rooms) which means that you should book ahead. Many newer hotels, business oriented, are found in the outskirts of cities and are sometimes larger structures (100 rooms or more); they may not be easy to reach with public transportation. The newer hotels are often part of national or international chains and have high standards. Many older hotels are now part of chains and provide standardized service but they retain their own atmosphere.\n\nWhen visiting Paris, it is essential to stay in the city; there are cheaper tourism hotels in the suburbs, but these cater to groups in motor coaches; they will be hard to reach by public transportation.\n\nAlong the highways, at the entrance of cities, you find US-like motels ; they are very often reachable only by car.  Some motels (e.g. ''Formule 1'') have minimal service, if you come in late you find an ATM-like machine, using credit cards, which will deliver a code in order to reach your assigned room.\n\n===B &amp; Bs and G\u00eetes ===\nThroughout France, mainly in rural areas but also in towns and cities, you can find '''[[Bed and breakfasts|B&Bs]]''' and '''g\u00eetes'''. \n\n'''B&B's''' are known in French as \"Chambres d'h\u00f4tes\" and are generally available on a nightly basis.  By law, breakfast MUST be included in the advertised price for a \"chambre d'h\u00f4te\". Bear this in mind when comparing prices with hotels, where breakfast is NOT included in the room price.\n\n'''Gites''' or '''gites ruraux''' are holiday cottages, and generally rented out as a complete accommodation unit including a kitchen, mostly on a weekly basis. There are very few near or in the cities. Finding them requires buying a guide or, for greater choice, using the internet, as you will not find a lot of signposts on the road.\n\nTraditionally, gites provided basic good value accommodation, typically adjacent to the owners household or in a nearby outbuilding. More recently the term has been extended, and can now be used to describe most country-based self-catering accommodation in France. Hence it includes accommodation as varied as small cottages villas with private swimming pools.\n\nDuring peak summer months the best self-catering gites require booking several months in advance.\n\nThere are thousands of B&Bs and gites in France rented out by foreign owners, particularly British and Dutch, and these tend to be listed, sometimes exclusively, with English-language or international organisations and websites that can be found by keying the words \"chambres d'hotes\", \"gites\" or \"gites de france\" into any of the major search engines. \n\nThere is a large number of organisations and websites offering \"gites\". Literally the French word gite just means a place to spend the night; however it now largely used to describe rental cottages or self-catering holiday homes, usually in rural parts of France.\n\n====G\u00eetes de France====\nA France-wide cooperative organisation, '''Gites de France''' regroups on a voluntary basis more than 50,000 rural accommodations and was the first in France to offer a consistent rating system with comprehensive descriptions. \n\nDespite the name, Gites de France offers B&B as well as holiday rental (gite) accommodation.  \n\nThe \"Gites de France\" rating system uses wheat stalks called ''Epis'' (equivalent to stars), based on amenities rather than quality - though generally the two go together. \n\nThrough its website, bookings can be done directly with owners or through the local G\u00eetes de France booking agency (no extra fee for the traveler). Although an English language version is available for many of the website pages, for some departments the pages giving details of an individual gite are only in French. \n\nThere is no particular advantage in using Gites de France rather than one of the other online gites sites, or booking directly with a gite. The procedure is pretty standard for all gite booking sites, whether French or foreign - with the advantage that absolutely all the booking process can be done in English if you use an English-language portal, which is not always the case with Gites de France.\n\nAfter making a gite booking you will receive, by post, a contract to sign (gites only). Sign and return one copy. When signing write the words \"Read and approved\", and the name of your home town, before signing and dating the contract. You will normally be asked to pay a deposit of a quarter to a third of the booking fee. The rest will be required one month before the start of your holiday. When you arrive at the gite a security deposit, specified in the contact, should be given to the owner in cash. This will be returned at the end of your stay, less any fuel charges and breakages.\n\nAnother great resource for booking Gites and Villas in France is Holiday France Direct, It enables you to deal directly with the property owners and offers customers discounted ferry travel with Brittany Ferries. \n\n====G\u00eetes d'\u00e9tape====\nAnother possibility is ''g\u00eetes d'\u00e9tape''. These are more like overnight stays for hikers, like a mountain hut. They are mostly cheaper than the ''G\u00eetes de France'' but also much more basic.\n\n===Camping===\nCamping is very common in France. Most campsite are a little way out of the city centre and virtually all cater not just for tents but for Camper Vans/Caravans also. While all campsites have the basic facilities of Shower/toilet blocks, larger sites tend to offer a range of additional facilities such as bars and restaurants, self-service laundries, swimming pools or bicycle hire.\nAll campsites except for very small \"farm camping\" establishments must be registered with the authorities, and are officially graded  using a system of stars. \n\nIn coastal areas, three-star and four-star campgrounds must generally be booked in advance during the months of July and August, and many people book from one year to the next. In rural areas, outside of popular tourist spots, it is usually possible to show up unannounced, and find a place; this is particularly true with the municipal campsites that can be found in most small towns; though even then it may be advisable to ring up or email in advance to make sure. There are always exceptions.\n\nIn France it's forbidden to camp:\n*in woods, natural, regional and national parks\n*on public roads and streets\n*on the seaside\n*less than 200m from watering place used for human consumption\n*on natural protected sites\n*less than 500m from a protected monument\n*everywhere where it's forbidden by local laws\n*on private properties without the owner's consent.\n\n==Learn==\n\nFrance, of course, is the best place to acquire, maintain and develop your French. A number of institutions offer a variety of courses for travellers.\nSOFI 64 in Biarritz (South West) offers a special program for adults: French & Surf. Students can [http://www.sofi64.com learn French] and enjoy surfing in one of the most beautiful regions in France.\n\n==Work==\n\nIf you are by law required to obtain a visa or other type of authorisation to work and fail to do so, you risk possible arrest, prosecution, expulsion and prohibition from reentering France and the Schengen area.\n\nCitizens of EU and EEA countries (save from some Eastern European countries, for a temporary period) and Switzerland can work in France without having to secure a work permit. Most non-EU citizens will need a work permit - however, some non-EU citizens (such as Canadians, New Zealanders, etc) do '''not''' require a visa or work permit to work during their 90 day visa-free period of stay in France (see the 'Get in' section above for more information).\n\nIf you are an EU citizen or from an EEA country and  want to earn money to continue travelling, Interim agencies (e.g. Adecco, Manpower) are a good source of temporary jobs. You can also consider working in bars, restaurants, and/or nightclubs (they are often looking for English-speaking workers, particularly those restaurants in tourist areas - fast-food restaurants such as McDonald's and Quick are also always looking for people).\n\nA lot of \"student jobs\", if you happen to be in a big city, are also available for younger travelers, and foreigners are often very welcome. Such jobs include, for example, [[Teaching English|giving private English lessons]], taking care of young children or many other things...check out the university buildings, they often have a lot of advertisements. An easy way to find job offers in France is to use the [https://fr.jobted.com/ Jobted France] search engine.\n\nDon't forget that being an English speaker is a big advantage when you're looking for a job - French employers really have a problem finding English-speaking workers. Do note, however, that it will be much easier for you if you know a bit of French, for the same reason (your colleagues are not likely to speak English). However, don't overestimate your chances of finding work; there are a lot more people looking for jobs than there are jobs - except those unattractive jobs that no-one wants to do.\n\nThe French work market tends to operate through personal contacts - if you know someone that works somewhere, you can probably figure out quite an easy way to work at that place too. It always helps to know people living in the area you wish to work.\n\n==Stay safe==\n===Crimes===\nCrime-related emergencies can be reported to the toll-free number 17. Law enforcement forces are the National Police (''Police Nationale'') in urban area and the Gendarmerie in rural area, though for limited issues such as parking and traffic offenses some towns and villages also have a municipal police.\n\nEven if France is a low-crime area, the murder rate is about the double of the surrounding countries and large cities are plagued with the usual woes. Violent crime against tourists or strangers is rare, but there is pickpocketing and purse-snatching.\n\nThe inner city areas and a few select suburbs are usually safe at all hours. In large cities, especially Paris, there are a few areas which are better to avoid. Parts of the suburban are sometimes grounds for youth gang violent activities and drug dealing; however these are almost always far from touristic points and you should have no reason to visit them. Common sense applies: it is very easy to spot derelict areas.\n\nThe subject of crime in the poorer suburbs is very touchy as it may easily have racist overtones, since many people associate it with working-class youth of North African origin. You should probably not express any opinion on the issue.\n\nUsual caution apply for tourists flocking around sights as they may become targets for pickpockets. A usual trick is to ask tourists to sign fake petitions and give some money, which is a way to put pressure on the victim. Stay away from people requesting money without any organization badge.\n\nWhile it is not compulsory for French citizens to carry identification, they usually do so. Foreigners should carry some kind of official identity document. Although random checks are not the norm you may be asked for an ID in some kinds of situations, for example if you cannot show a valid ticket when using public transportation; not having one in such cases will result in you being taken to a police station for further checks. Even if you feel that law enforcement officers have no right to check your identity (they can do so only in certain circumstances), it is a bad idea to enter a legal discussion with them; it is better to put up with it and show ID. Again, the subject is touchy as the police have often been accused of targeting people according to criteria of ethnicity (e.g. ''d\u00e9lit de sale gueule'' = literally \"crime of a dirty face\" but perhaps equivalent to the American \"driving while black.\")\n\nDue to the terrorist factor, police, with the help of military units, are patrolling monuments, the Paris subway, train stations and airports. Depending on the status of the \"Vigipirate\" plan (anti terrorist units) it is not uncommon to see armed patrols in those areas. The presence of police is of help for tourists, as it also deters pickpockets and the like. However, suspicious behaviour, public disturbances etc., may result in policemen asking to see an ID.\n\nIn France, failing to offer assistance to 'a person in danger' is illegal. This means that if you fail to stop upon witnessing a motor accident, fail to report such an accident to emergency services, or ignore appeals for help or urgent assistance, you may be charged. Penalties include suspended prison sentence and fines. The law does not apply in situations where to answer an appeal for help might endanger your life or the lives of others.\n\nGay marriage is legal in France and members of the LGBT community are generally met with great acceptance throughout the country, including smaller towns. In fact, France regularly ranks among the very most tolerant countries in the EU regarding same-sex couples. Comme sense should apply, however, and in some specific areas - such as disenfrenchised outstirts of big cities, or in the most conservative and isolated parts of the French countryside - LGBT couples should keep a fairly low profile in order to avoid possible derogatory remarks.\n\n===Controlled substances===\nCarrying or using narcotic substances, from marijuana to hard drugs, is illegal whatever the quantity. The penalty can be severe especially if you are suspected of dealing. Trains and cars coming from countries which have a more lenient attitude (like the Netherlands) are especially targeted. Police have often been known to stop entire coaches and search every passenger and their bags thouroughly just because they're coming from Amsterdam.\n\nFrance has a liberal policy with respect to alcohol (except when it come to driving under influence); there are usually no ID checks for purchasing alcohol (unless you look much younger than 18). However, causing problems due to public drunkenness is a misdemeanor and may result in a night in a police station. Drunk driving is a severe offense and may result in heavy fines and jail sentences.\n\nA little etiquette note: while it is common to drink beer straight from the bottle at informal meetings, doing the same with wine is normally only done by tramps (''clochards'').\n\n==Stay healthy==\n\n===Tap water===\nTap water (''Eau du robinet'') is drinkable, except in rare cases such as rural rest areas and sinks in train bathrooms, in which case it will be clearly signposted as ''Eau non potable''. ''Eau potable'' is potable water. (You may, however, not like the taste which may be chlorinated, bottled water is common.)\n\n===Medical help===\nThe health care in France is of a very high standard.\n\nPharmacies in France are denoted by a green cross, usually in neon. They sell medicines, contraceptives, and often beauty and related products (though these can be very expensive). Medicines must be ordered from the counter, even non-prescription medicines. The pharmacist is able to help you about various medicines and propose you generic drugs.\n\nSince drug brand names vary across countries even though the effective ingredients stay the same, it is better to carry prescriptions using the international nomenclature in addition to the commercial brand name. Prescription drugs, including oral contraceptives (aka \"the pill\"), will only be delivered if a doctor's prescription is shown.\n\nIn addition, supermarkets sell condoms (''pr\u00e9servatifs'') and also often personal lubricant, bandages, disinfectant and other minor medical item.  Condom machines are often found in bar toilets, etc.\n\nMedical treatment can be obtained from self-employed physicians, clinics and hospitals. Most general practitioners, specialists (e.g. gynecologists), and dentists are self-employed; look for signs saying ''Docteur'' (''m\u00e9decine g\u00e9n\u00e9rale'' is general practitioner). The normal price for a consultation with a general practitioner is \u20ac23, though some physicians charge more (this is the full price and not a co-payment). Physicians may also do home calls, but these are more expensive.\n\nResidents of the European Union are covered by the French social security system, which will reimburse or directly pay for 70% of health expenses (30% co-payment) in general, though many physicians and surgeons apply surcharges. Other travellers are ''not'' covered and will be billed the full price, even if at a public hospital; non-EU travellers should have travel insurance covering medical costs.\n\n===Emergencies===\nHospitals will have an emergency room signposted ''Urgences''.\n\nThe following numbers are toll-free:\n* '''15''' Medical emergencies\n* '''17''' Law enforcement emergencies (for e.g. reporting a crime)\n* '''18''' Firefighters\n* '''112''' European standard emergency numbers.\nOperators at these numbers can transfer requests to other services if needed (e.g. some medical emergencies may be answered by firefighter groups).\n\n===Smoking===\nSmoking is prohibited by law in all enclosed spaces accessible to the public (this includes train and subway cars, train and subway station enclosures, workplaces, restaurants and caf\u00e9s) unless in areas specifically designated for smoking, and there are few of these. There was an exception for restaurants and caf\u00e9s, but since the 1st January 2008, the smoking ban law is also enforced there. You may face a fine of \u20ac68 if you are found smoking in these places.\n \nSmoking is banned in m\u00e9tro and trains, as well as enclosed stations. Subway and train conductors do enforce the law and will fine you for smoking in non-designated places; if you encounter problems with a smoker in train, you may go find the conductor.\n\nAs hotels are not considered as public places, some offer smoking vs non-smoking rooms.\n\nOnly people over the age 18 may purchase tobacco products. Shopkeepers may request a photo ID.\n\n==Respect==\nThe French adhere to a strong set of values. They cherish their culture, history, language and cuisine, which is considered an art. Once gained acquaintance, the French become warm, sincere and welcoming.\n\nThe French are often criticised by many visitors and tourists alike for being \"rude\" and/or \"arrogant\", but this is infact a very common misunderstanding. Communication, like in many parts of Europe, tends to be direct, and small-talk is widely ignored unless there is an absolutely necessity for it. It's very uncommon for strangers to communicate with one another, especially on public transportation.\n\nIt's worth noting that France is one of very few countries in the world where offering assistance or a helping hand is almost non-existent, and the French in general have very little patience with those that do. For instance, it's common to be  dismissed for asking someone on the streets to take a photograph of you. Do not try and take this personally as this is simply a cornerstone of French culture.\n\n=== Social Etiquette ===\n* '''The French in general are straightforward'''. The French are more direct with giving criticism, and in many cases you can expect to be given straight answer if you've done something inappropriate. In the business world, there's no such thing as a \"perfect\" or \"very good\" idea. Although it may seem like you're in the company of people that are constantly dissatisfied with almost everything, perhaps yourself, do not take this personally in any way as it is not intended to make you feel bad about yourself. Exigency is so deeply embedded into French society, that some may not even think about what they say. Remember that they are just as critical of themselves. A visitor can be fairly certain that if someone criticises them, it's a sign that someone takes them seriously and cares about their well-being. \n\n* '''The French value their privacy'''. Asking about someone's age, salary and other personal questions is considered quite rude, especially if you're not very close to them. It's worth noting that the French like to separate their personal and business lives. For this reason, never call a French person at home unless it is an urgent matter. \n\n* '''The French are reserved with those they do not know very well'''. For this reason, one may assume that the French are a grumpy and grim folk, but it's largely because the desire to engage in small talk and niceties is seldom engaged in. Smiling at a stranger, especially if it's someone you don't know, is often perceived as superficial and invasive. Once you do get to know someone, you'll find them to be more open and candid. \n\n* '''The French do not like to tell punchline jokes'''. One may share interesting, humorous life experiences, but telling punchline jokes isn't very well received in France. \n\n* '''Never be loud in a public place'''. The French have a marvellous and intimately quiet way of communicating with one another, and it is best to follow suit with this to avoid standing out like a sore thumb. It's not unheard of for people to tell others off for being loud.\n\n* '''Always exchange pleasantries wherever you go'''. It is prudent to exchange greetings wherever you go in public, wait for them to reply and make your request for anything that you may need. Not doing so can cause offence. In a shop, it's good form to always ask the shopkeeper(s) to take items from the shelf as opposed to picking something up yourself, and always have them guide you around if you're just exploring. It's best to follow suit with this to avoid standing out like a sore thumb. It's not unheard of for people to be dismissed for having poor etiquette in the service industry. \n\n* '''Make an attempt to speak in French before speaking in English'''. The French are very proud of their diverse language, and in many cases you'll find that people will become noticeably aloof if you approach them speaking English instead of French. Start a conversation in French, and then ask if someone speaks English. The French know their language is a difficult one to learn, and they don't expect you to be fluent in it. Whatever efforts you make will be warmly and genuinely appreciated. \n\n* '''Always be punctual for any meeting and appointment'''. As in many other countries in Europe, The French pride themselves on punctuality. Being late to any meeting or appointment is considered impolite and unprofessional. If you're going to be late to something, be sure to apologise and explain the situation. This said, the further you go south in the country, the more flexible time is.\n\n=== Home Etiquette ===\n* '''If you are invited to somebody's home, bring them a small gift as a form of respect'''. Take some biscuits for coffee, some cake or desserts, and you\u2019ll be warmly and genuinely received. A gift should be of high quality. Avoid giving gifts with your company logo stamped on them as it considered garish. \n\n* '''Never ask your hosts to give you a tour of their home'''. It's considered rude manners, even if it is not your intention.\n\n=== Dining Etiquette ===\n\n* '''Never leave your phone on the table'''. It's considered very rude manners.\n\n* '''Never be impatient with waiters at restaurants'''. It's important to bear in mind that waiting is a revered profession in France, and people have to go through lots of training to become one. You're not obligated to tip waiters, but you can if you wish.\n\n* '''Never ask your food to be separated into individual parts'''. In France, people strive to deliver the best experience wherever possible, and asking your food to be separated may offend or upset some. \n\n* '''Never discuss business when eating out'''. The French dislike to talk about work and business when eating out, and it's more of a time to enjoy good food, wine and discussion. \n\n* '''Never eat unless everyone has been asked to'''. Eating immediately is seen as impolite.\n\n===M\u00e9tro Etiquette ===\nThe M\u00e9tro subway system is a great way to get around Paris (or Lyon, Marseille, et al.), which is readily apparent in the throngs of people that use it to go to work, school, and the like.  If you do not ride the train  at home, or if you come from a place that doesn't have a subway system, there are certain points of etiquette that you may not be aware of. \n \n* '''When boarding at the station, let those exiting the train step off onto the platform before boarding, and once aboard move to the centre of the car'''.  If you have luggage, move it as far out of the path of others as possible (on the RER B to Charles de Gaulle airport, use the luggage racks above the seats instead). Certain stations have moving sidewalks to cover the distances between platforms - '''walk on the left and stand on the right'''.  \n\n* Do note that the doors on French subway cars don't generally open automatically once the train has stopped at the station; rather, most cars have a small button or lever on the doors that opens them.  If you should happen to be standing near the door in a crowded car you might hear someone behind you say \"la porte, s'il vous plait,\" which means that person would like to get off the train and is asking you to open the door for him/her.  Pop the door open and step aside (or down onto the platform) while that person exits the train - the driver will wait for you to get back on.\n\n===Dressing Etiquette===\nDress codes are fast disappearing, but if you want to avoid looking like a tourist, then  avoid white sneakers, baseball caps, tracksuit pants, shorts and flip-flops (except at the beach).  Generally speaking, business casual dress code is sufficient in cities and in all but the most formal occasions.\n\n* When it comes to women's urban wear, very short skirts, largely open cleavage, or ostensibly sexy clothing in general, is considered poor taste in France, especially in the colder climates of northern France (including Paris). Women dressing this way taking public transportation or walking in the street to a club, may be heckled on the way, or get looks of disapproval.\n\n* Usual courtesy applies when entering churches, and although you may not be asked to leave, it is better to avoid short pants and halter tops.\n\n* Some restaurants will frown if you come in dressed for trekking but very few will insist upon a jacket and tie. You may be surprised by the number of French twenty-somethings who show up at a grungy bar in jacket and tie, even if obviously from a thrift-shop.\n\n* Beaches and swimming pools (in hotels) are used for getting a tan. Taking off your bra will not usually create a stir if you don't mind a bevy of oglers. Taking off the bottom part is reserved to designated nude beaches. People on beaches are usually not offended by a young boy or girl undressed. Most resort cities insist on your wearing a shirt when leaving the beach area. Many pools will not allow baggy or \"board\" swim trunks, insisting on snug fitting speedo type trunks.\n\n===Things to Avoid===\n\n'''Politics:'''\n* '''Unless you really follow French news closely, you should probably steer clear of discussing internal French politics''' as you may come across as judgemental and uninformed. Don't be discouraged from engaging in political discussions with French people, just be aware of the position that being a foreigner puts you in. It is also considered rude to ask a person point-blank about which candidate he/she voted for in the last election (or will vote for in the next); instead, talk about the issues and take it from there.\n\n'''Religion:''' \n* '''The French seldom advertise their religious feelings''', however, and expect you to avoid doing so as well. Doing so might make people feel uneasy and/or uncomfortable. It is also generally considered impolite to inquire about religious or other personal issues. While France has barred religious symbols from public places including Sikh turban, Islamic hijab and Jewish kippah on grounds of secularism, this controversial topic is best avoided in polite conversations. People practicing those faiths need to be aware of the unfriendly attitudes that some in France hold to expression of religion in public places.\n\n'''Money:''' \n* '''You should also avoid presenting yourself through what you own''', as it may make the French lose their respect and appreciation of you. It is also considered to rude to discuss your salary, or to ask someone else directly about theirs. Finances are a strictly private matter.\n\n==Contact==\n\n===Phone===\nThe pan-European emergency number is <big>'''''112'''''</big><br />\nand this is probably a better choice than  the numbers listed below if you don't speak French.\n\nOther emergency numbers are\n*'''15''' for medical aid \n*'''17''' for the police\n*'''18''' for fire and rescue\nThese calls are free and accessible from virtually any phone, including locked cellphones. In case of a ''serious'' emergency, if you find a code-protected cellphone, enter a random code three times: the phone will lock, but you will be able to dial emergency numbers.\n\nTo call a French number from abroad, dial: international prefix + ''33'' + local number ''without the leading 0''.\nFor example: +33 247 664 118\n\nAll French numbers have 10 digits. The first two digits are: \n\n* '''01''' for the Parisian region \n* '''02''' for the Northwest \n* '''03''' for the Northeast \n* '''04''' for the Southeast \n* '''05''' for the Southwest \n* '''06''' for cellphones \n* '''07''' for cellphones since 2010.\n* '''08''' have special prices (infuriatingly, from free of charge to very costly indeed - Skype numbers start with ''08''). A rule of thumb to know the price is as follow: the lower the next 2 numbers are, the cheaper the price is (a number beginning with '''0800''' is free from a landline, while a number beginning with '''0892''' will cost extra).\n* '''09''' if they are attached to Voice over IP telephones connected to DSL modems from French DSL providers that integrate such functions. \n\nYou cannot drop the first two digits even if your call remains within the same area. The initial '0' may be replaced by some other digit or longer code indicating a choice of long-distance operator. Don't use this unless explicitly told to.\n\nWhen speaking phone numbers, people will usually group the digits by sets of two.  For example, ''02 47 66 41 18'' will be said as \"zero two, forty-seven, sixty-six, forty-one, eighteen\" (but in French, of course). The two-digit pair ''00'' is said as \"zero zero\", not \"double zero\". for example if your phone number is 02 47 66 41 18 in France, it would be said as \"z\u00e9ro deux, quarante-sept, soixante-six, quarante et un, dix-huit.\" Difficulties can arise when numbers between 60 and 99 exist in the phone number, as the French word for seventy, \"soixante dix\" literally means \"sixty ten\", the word for eighty, \"quatre-vingt\" means \"four-twenty\" and ninety, \"quatre-vingt-dix\" means \"four-twenty-ten\". So when giving a number such as \"72\", you might hear \"soixante\", start writing a 6, and have to correct yourself when the number turns out to be \"soixante-douze\".\n\nIf you find it too hard to follow, you may ask the person to say the number digit-by-digit (\"chiffre par chiffre\"). It would then be \"zero, two, four, seven, \nsix, six, four, one, one, eight\" (\"z\u00e9ro, deux, quatre, sept, six, six, quatre, un, un, huit\").\n\nYou can to visit [http://www.callersmart.com/articles/8/International-Dial-Code-Directory International Dial Code Directory] to find instructions about the nationals and internationals calls.\n\n====Toll-free====\nThere are few companies that provide toll-free numbers (starting with ''08 00'') but many have numbers starting with ''081'', for which you pay the cost of a local call regardless of where you are in the country.\n\nNumbers starting with ''089'' are heavily surcharged. They provide service to some legitimate businesses but the ones you see advertised all over the country are usually for adult services.\n\n====Cheap international calls====\nDial-around services are directly available from any landline in France. No contract, no registration is required. Most dial-around services allows you to call USA, Canada, Western Europe and many other countries at local rate (''tarif local'') so you can easily save on your phone bill. They also work from payphones, though the first minute is surcharged by France Telecom.\n\nYou can also use Viber, WhatsApp, FaceTime using your phone and a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot. This is probably one of the cheapest solutions for travellers in France.\n\n====Fixed line====\nTo find out how to get a landline (''ligne fixe'') in France [http://www.justlanded.com/francais/france/tools/just_landed_guide/telephone/fixed_lines/ Just Landed] gives more information on the subject of French landline providers. Another method, if you are staying for a long period, is to use VoIP over DSL, such as the Livebox or Freebox service (free long distance calls within France and to a number of countries).\n\n====Public call boxes====\nPhone booths are available in train or subway stations, bus stops, near tourist attractions, etc.  There is at least one phone booth in every village (look on the main plaza). Due to the widespread use of mobile phones, there are now fewer booths than a few years ago.  Most use a card (no coins). France T\u00e9l\u00e9com public phones accept CB/Visa/MasterCard cards but almost always only with a microchip.  Otherwise, post offices, caf\u00e9-tabacs (recognizable by a red sign hanging outside), and stores that sell magazines sell phone cards.  Ask for a \"carte telephonique\"; these come with differing units of credit, so you may want to specify \"petit\" if you just want to make a short local call or two. If you get the kind with a computer chip in it, you just have to slide it into the phone, listen for the dial tone, and dial. The US-style cards require you to dial a number and then enter a code (but with spoken instructions in French).\n\n====Mobile====\nFrance uses the GSM standard of cellular phones (900MHz and 1800MHz bands) used in most of the world outside of the US. There are 4 'physical' network operators in France: Orange, SFR, Bouygues T\u00e9lecom and Free Mobile. Other providers are mobile virtual operators based on Orange, SFR or Bouygues T\u00e9l\u00e9com. France is almost totally covered but you may have difficulties using your mobile phone in rural or mountainous areas. However, for emergency numbers, the four companies are required by law to accept your call if they technically can, even if you are not one of their customers, thus maximizing your chance of being helped even in areas with spotty service.\n\nIf you are staying for some time in France it is advisable to buy a prepaid SIM card for your phone so that incoming calls are free. Additionally, French businesses and individuals are unlikely to want to call an international number to get hold of you as there will be a surcharge to them. \nMost service providers such as (Orange, SFR and Bouygues Telecom) supply SIM cards in shops; for instance Orange promotes Orange holiday, which allows you to use 120 international minutes and 1000 texts within all Europe + 1GB data in France for about \u20ac40. The plan can be purchased quite easily in Orange shops.\nBut be aware that the credit expires when you do not top-up. \n\nIf you want to sort out your phone before you leave, [http://www.lefrenchmobile.com LeFrenchMobile] provides a prepaid service for foreigners coming to France.  You do not always need identification at the point-of-purchase but you need to be have your personal details (including an address: your hotel address will do) in-hand to activate the service, even on prepaid lines. Another company that can help you efficiently sort out your international sim card needs is [http://www.travelsim.com/ TravelSim]. Their prepaid sim card is one of the cheapest on the market and, since it is a callback service, your can save up to 85% on your roaming charges. Additionally, all incoming sms and Skype calls are free on TravelSim numbers. With this sim card you can easily make phone calls in France and when you go outside of the country.\n\n[http://lebara.fr Lebara] offer relatively cheap pre-pay data plans. (\u20ac8 for 1GB) If your phone doesn't access the internet correctly you may need to manually set your phones' \"access point name\" username/pass to web/web.\n\n===Internet===\n\n====Internet cafes====\nInternet access is available at cyber cafes in large and medium-sized cities all over. Service is usually around \u20ac4 per hour. However, with most homes now wired for the internet, cyber cafes are increasingly hard to find, especially outside the major cities.  \n\n====Residential broadband====\nIn all major cities, there are multiple companies offering residential broadband service. Typical prices are \u20ac30  a month for unmetered ADSL (in speeds up to 24 megabits per second), digital HDTV over DSL and free unlimited voice-over-IP phone calls to land lines within France and about twenty other countries (EU,US,...) with external SIP access too (the price includes a modem/routeur/switch with integrated Wi-Fi MiMo access point). Broadband services are very common in France, all over the country.\nFor long-term stays, getting internet access without contract is vital and CCTechnician is a popular choice with ExPats.\n\n====Wi-Fi====\nYou'll also find Wi-Fi access in a lot of caf\u00e9s usually those labelled a bit \"trendy\". There will be a sign on the door or on the wall. Also look for the ''@'' symbol prominently displayed, which indicates internet availability. In Paris, one popular Wi-Fi free spot is the Pompidou Centre. There is talk that the city intends to become the first major European capital providing free Wi-Fi coverage for the whole city. Public parks and libraries in Paris are also covered.\n\n====Mobile Internet Access====\n\n*'''[http://moxx.fr MOXX.fr]''' provides secure high quality internet network via pocket Wi-Fi rental on a short term basis for affordable prices. This service is powered by a main French internet provider.\n\n===Post===\nPost offices are found in all cities and villages but their time of operation vary. In the main cities the downtown office may be open during lunchtime, typically 09:00-18:00. Most offices are only open on Saturday morning and there is only one office in Paris which is open 24/7 (in rue du Louvre).\n\nLetter boxes are yellow.\n\n===Parcels===\nInternational delivery services like FedEx, UPS, are available in cities, however you generally have to call them for them to come to you as they have very few physical locations.\n\nAnother option is to simply use ''La Poste'' with a wide network around the country and the same services as its competitors.\n\n==Cope==\n'''Toilets''' are available in restaurants, caf\u00e9s; there are also public facilities, which generally charge a fee. Note that American euphemisms such as \"restroom\", \"washroom\" etc. will often not be understood; ask for \"toilets\". In older public facilities, particularly those that do not charge or isolated rest areas, you may encounter squat toilets.\n\n<!--Some images from Shared and En: for possible use here:\nNormandy:\nImage:P1040767.JPG (in En:, Open fishing boats pulled up on a pebble beach)\nImage:P1040695.JPG (in En:, not very good quality, pictureque buildings below cliffs)\n\nTransport:\nImage:Chunnel.JPG|Tour Bus, in train, in the Chunnel\n-->\n\n{{isPartOf|Europe}}\n{{outline}}\n{{countryguide}}\n\n[[ca:Fran\u00e7a]]\n[[de:Frankreich]]\n[[eo:Francio]]\n[[es:Francia]]\n[[fi:Ranska]]\n[[fr:France]]\n[[he:\u05e6\u05e8\u05e4\u05ea]]\n[[hu:Franciaorsz\u00e1g]]\n[[it:Francia]]\n[[ja:\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9]]\n[[nl:Frankrijk]]\n[[pl:Francja]]\n[[pt:Fran\u00e7a]]\n[[ro:Fran\u0163a]]\n[[ru:\u0424\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u044f]]\n[[sv:Frankrike]]\n[[zh:\u6cd5\u570b]]\n\n[[wts:Category:France]]\n[[WikiPedia:France]]\n[[Dmoz:Europe/France/]]\n[[World66:europe/france]]\n\n{{related|Driving in France}}\n\n{{hasDocent|Hrcolyer}}"

It lies just northeast of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and southwest of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. It is famous for spices and is known as the \"Spice Isle\", being a major source of nutmeg, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and cocoa.\n\nFor a tourist introduction, try '''The Grenada Board of Tourism''' [http://www.grenadagrenadines.com], PO Box 293, St. George\u2019s, Grenada. Tel: 473 440-2279, fax: 473 440-6637, [mailto:gbt@spiceisle.com gbt@spiceisle.com].\n\n\n==Understand==\n===History===\nChristopher Columbus discovered Grenada in 1498. The island was already inhabited by the Carib Indians, who had migrated from the South American mainland, killing or enslaving the peaceful Arawaks who were already inhabitants there. The Amerindians called their island Camerhogue, but Columbus renamed it Concepci\u00f3n. However, passing Spanish sailors found its lush green hills so evocative of Andalusia that they rejected this name in favor of ''Granada''.\n\nOver the centuries, although control of the island passed from France to Britain (and briefly back to France again), the name endured with just the slightest of alterations, changing from \"Granada\" to \"La Grenade\" to \"Grenada\".\n\nThe French were the first to settle Grenada. Legend holds that in 1652 the last of the defending Caribs rather than be ruled by the French, threw themselves into the sea from a spot that was christened Le Morne des Sauteurs, and is known today as Leapers' Hill and Carib's Leap. \n\nExploited first for indigo (hence the name of an area \"True Blue\"), and later for sugar production, the island prospered and, like many others in the Caribbean, attracted the attention of the British. Captured by Admiral George Rodney in 1762, near the end of the European Seven Years' War (1756-63), Grenada reverted to French rule from 1779 until 1783 when the island was restored to Britain by the Treaty of Versailles. \n\nThe inhabitants' loyalties remained divided between the two European powers for many years, as illustrated by Fedon's Rebellion of 1795. In the course of this violent episode, a group of rebels under the command of the mulatto General Julien Fedon, and inspired by the rhetoric of the French Revolution wreaked havoc on the island and its British settlers in an unsuccessful attempt to reunite with France.\n\nFrom 1784 until its independence in 1974, Grenada remained a member of the British Empire, passing through various stages of colonial status and multiple associations with other regional states. In 1967, Grenada became an \"Associated State of Great Britain\" within the British Commonwealth. With this, the island nation gained control of its internal affairs, while the government of Britain continued to control external matters.\n\nEarly in the twentieth century, it produced one of the region's outstanding leaders, T. Albert Marryshow. His Representative Government Association, which inspired similar movements in other Windward Islands states and in Trinidad, did much to encourage the liberalization of British rule in the Caribbean. \n\nIt is ironic that the achievement in 1950 of universal adult suffrage, long a goal of Marryshow's, led directly to his displacement in Grenadian political life by a new figure, Eric Matthew Gairy. Whereas Marryshow had been a man of the middle class, Gairy and his Grenada United Labour Party (GULP) appealed to the lower class, the peasantry. Suddenly empowered by the vote, Gairy's supporters swept him to the leadership of the Legislative Council in 1951; he dominated the island's politics for almost three decades.\n\nThe most successful electoral challenge to Gairy between 1951 and 1979 was posed by Herbert Blaize's Grenada National Party (GNP) in 1961, mainly on the issue of union with Trinidad and Tobago (the \"unitary state\" proposal). Again reflecting the Grenadian penchant for looking outward for support and viability, the GNP campaigned on a platform urging acceptance of the Trinidadian offer of union. Although Blaize's party won the election, it subsequently lost a large measure of prestige and credibility when Trinidad failed to follow through on the proposal. The GNP's fall from grace paved the way for the return of Gairy, who has never tired of the role of political savior of his country. Complete independence was achieved in 1974, with significant opposition, under the leadership of the late Sir Eric Gairy -- a charismatic and controversial figure who had been in the public eye since the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1979, after a Coup d'etat, an attempt was made to set up a socialist/communist state in Grenada. Four years later, at the request of the Governor General, the United States, Jamaica, and the Eastern Caribbean States intervened militarily. Launching their now famous \"rescue mission\", the allied forces restored order, and in December of 1984 a general election re-established democratic government.\n\nThe last 31 years have been a peaceful, democratic and fruitful back to normal existence, which has included many new building structures and vastly improved infrastructure.\n\n===Climate===\nAverage temperatures range from 24&deg;C/ 75&deg;F to 30&deg;C/ 87&deg;F, tempered by the steady and cooling trade winds. The lowest temperatures occur between January and April. The driest season is between January and May. The rainy season is from June to December, where several days out of the week may see rain at some point in the day. Generally when it rains it doesn't last for more than an hour at a time.\n\n==Islands==\n[[Image:Grenada Regions map.png|thumb|375px|Map of Grenada]]\n{{Regionlist\n\n| region1name=[[Grenada (island)|Grenada]]  \n| region1color=#71b37b\n| region1items=\n| region1description=By far the largest island, where most of the nation's people live\n\n| region2name=[[Carriacou]]\n| region2color=#4f93c0\n| region2items= \n| region2description=The second largest island, home to the town of [[Hillsborough (Grenada)|Hillsborough]]\n\n| region3name=[[Petit Martinique]]\n| region3color=#d56d76\n| region3items= \n| region3description=A distant third-largest island, limited tourist facilities.\n\n\n}}\n\n==Cities==\n\n* [[St. George's]] - national capital\n* [[Grand Anse Bay]] - main tourist area\n* [[Gouyave]] - capital of the St. John district - Home of the 'Fish Friday' weekly event\n* [[Sauteurs]] - capital of the St. Patrick district\n* [[Grenville]] - capital of the St. Andrew district\n* [[Hillsborough (Grenada)|Hillsborough]] - main town of Carriacou\n\n==Other destinations==\n\n\n\n==Get in==\nA valid [[passport]] and return or onward ticket is required.

A large cruise ship terminal was completed in 2005, allowing up to 4 ships to be docked at once. The terminal \"mall\" houses numerous shops, some typical for Caribbean cruises, a few unique to the island.\n\nPrivate moorings for yachts are available all around the island.\n\n*''' Osprey Lines Limited''', Tel: (473) 440-8126, [http://www.ospreylines.com]. Ferry service between the islands of  Granada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique. \n\n*Charters of various sizes and crews can be found by inquiring at hotels or the Grenada Yacht Club in [[St. George]] or the island's official tourism website: www.grenadagrenadines.com.\n\n==Get around==\n\nThe town centre has several hilly, narrow streets.  Drivers are very careful but personal care must be taken as some streets have very narrow or no sidewalks.\n\nThe town also has the most picturesque horse-shoe harbour in the Caribbean with restaurants, shops and supermarkets. \n\nTravel in and around the city [[St. George's]] is by taxis, minibuses or hired cars.  Hailing a taxi is similar to other parts of the world - hold out a hand and beckon to the driver.  Taxis carry an 'H' on their licence plates.  The independently owned, but government licensed, cars and vans will stop and ask if one wants a ride.  Some standard fares include EC$30 from the airport to St. George's and EC$25-$40 for trips from most hotels to the various dining spots around the city.\n\n'''Buses''' in Grenada are the standardized form of transportation. They are mini-vans that hold between 15-19 people, and they have route numbers and signs on them. In the centre of town (Melville Street), there is a bus terminal and in and around the town there are designated bus stops, however, once you leave town, you can signal a stop by either knocking on the side of the bus or pressing the stop button. Conductors and drivers are always very friendly, so do not hesitate to ask them where you should stop. Bus fares vary between EC$2.50-10.00 depending on the distance. They are lively trips, with great music and a nice breeze.\n\n[[Renting a car|Car rentals]] are available, with rates of US$50-75 per day.  With a valid license from your home country you will qualify for a temporary Grenada license which can be obtained from any police station for a fee of EC$30. '''Drive on the left''' and make frequent use of the car's horn when coming around the numerous blind corners in the mountains.\n\n'''Water taxis''' are another means of getting around - between the Cruise Terminal, Grand Anse Beach and the Carenage.\n\n==Talk==\n\nStandard (British) English is the official language of Grenada and is widely spoken. However an English-based Creole language (not referred to as such by locals) is the dominant tongue of most Grenadian people and can be difficult for people outside of the Caribbean region to understand. French Patois used to be the dialect language spoken within Grenada, but it only remains within the older generations and in scattered pockets. Most Grenadians only know a few words.\n\n==See==\nThere is so much to see in Grenada ... historic forts, lakes, waterfalls, spice estates - some of them still operational today, spice gardens, floral gardens (Grenada won its 7th Gold Medal at the Chelsea Flower Show in London in 2009), rum distilleries (with generous samples), plantation houses, Amerindian petroglyphs, etc.\n\nNote:  Some of the sites noted below may be closed on Saturdays and Sundays.

Gouyave is regarded as the town that never sleeps. It is a great evening out with a nice drive to this West Coast fishing village. Don't be afraid to venture out.  It is perfectly safe and frequented by tourists and international students from the Medical School.  The food is fresh, inexpensive, and prepared before your eyes. There is festive music, lots of kids milling about, and the night ends in a party at various night clubs.  One can have a great meal and a couple of beers for less than $10 US. Lobster, shrimp, and fresh fish, right out of the water is prepared in various forms.  Dress casual with comfortable waking shoes and check out all the stalls and offerings before deciding on what to eat. It is actually possible to take a bus to Gouyave from the tourist areas for about $2 US, but if you plan to hang late, there is no guarantee of getting back to town after 8 pm.  So taxi or \"on demand\" vehicle may be your best bet. Some hotels and ground tour operators also offer tours that will take you to/and from Fish Friday.  Gouyave is full of \"characters' who would do no more than entertain you. No need to be alarmed if they are overly friendly.  You are not likely to be accosted by hustlers as the locals are very protective of guests who patronize their showpiece event. \n \n*'''Diving & Snorkeling'''. The island has an abundance of marine sites (both Grenada & Carriacou) and the first Underwater Sculpture Park in the world.  The island is known as the Diving Capital of the Eastern Caribbean.  It has the largest shipwreck in the Caribbean - the Bianca C - a 600ft cruise ship which sunk in 1961, now lying in 167 feet of water.  There are more than 50 sites, including reefs, wrecks and walls most within 5-15 minutes boat ride from the dive shops.\n\n* River Tubing; Hiking; Mountain Biking; Sporting and family activities. \n\n*'''Get Married!'''

Support the local economy when on the island and buy local goodies to bring back home.\n\n[[Image:Nutmeg.jpeg|thumb|250px|Nutmeg]]\n\n'''Nutmeg''' is Grenada's cash crop, so be sure to bring some home in some form - whole, jam, jelly, syrup, Nutmed (medicinal ointment). In addition, you can purchase nutmeg flavored ice cream, which has an unusual flavor that is difficult to find elsewhere. Due to Hurricane Ivan in September of 2004, over 90% of Grenada's nutmeg crop was destroyed, but thankfully, you'll now see an abundance around the market, town, and tourist shops.  Other fine spices include mace, cinnamon, ginger cloves, vanilla, tumeric....\n\nTo bring herbs/spices back to the U.S. (and several other countries), they need to be within properly sealed containers.  Most responsible sellers offer them packaged - check to be sure.\n\nReal '''vanilla''' is a steal in the markets, sometimes it can be found for as little as $1US for a 1/2 litre bottle.  The concentration of the fluid does vary, but in its pure form there is a noticeable (and very pleasant) difference from the vanilla extract that most North Americans are used to.  You might also look for dried vanilla beans (in pod)...an essential to a full range of kitchen herbs/spices.\n\nLocally grown and produced chocolate is gaining a good reputation.  You can find excellent bars of varying cocoa percentage at the cooperative store, nearby Belmont Plantation, grocers, and the cruise terminal.\n\n'''Rum''' Grenada makes some of the best Rum.  You will understand what 'good' rum is when you try Rum made in Grenada, and may even become a convert when you 'sip a good rum'!\n\n'''Grenada Chocolate'''  one of the best in the world.  Dark, organic chocolate. Look for it's beautiful, brightly colored packaging.\n\nThe large cruise ship pier outside the main harbor offers a small, enclosed, \"duty-free\" mall.  It has several shops (and food outlets) offering both local items and those typically for cruise passengers.  Prices on local products may be at a premium to stores elsewhere on the island.  Just a block away, you'll find the spice market with stalls run by families and growers.\n\nYou might also consider <buy name=\"Grenada Discovery Train\" alt=\"\" address=\"cruise terminal St. Georges\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"www.grenadadiscoverytrain.com\" hours=\"0,45\" price=\"15$-20$\" lat=\"\" long=\"\">Unique narrated city sightseeing trips in St. Georges on-board the only trackless tourist train in Grenada.

It's 75% alcohol content makes it illegal to take home to many countries, at least on flights.  They make a version with 69% intended for \"exporting\" that ''may'' be legal.\n* At all the distilleries you can buy at least small bottles, and you'll find normal sizes  in most grocery stores and rum shops.\n\nIn many bars, take care with drinks made with \"under the counter\" ingredients, e.g., highly-overproof rums for \"locals\" often used in \"Pain Killers\".  They can overwhelm the most experienced drinkers.  Fruit juices they use are made from locally grown fruits such as mango, papaya, carambola (five fingers fruit).  A few \"watering holes\" (often with food service) include...\n* '''Pirate's Cove Restaurant and Jolly Roger Sports Bar'''\" \n* '''Grand View Inn''', Grand Anse - phone \"473.444.2342/4984\" [http://www.grenadagrandview.com/index.htm] Open for \"B- 7-10, L- 11-2, D- 7-9, offering local fare at modest prices, to include banquets, catering, and parties.

However, the high humidity and glaring sun in the summer means you should drink plenty of water. Take bottled water on outings. There may be more danger for pedestrians on the narrow sidewalks and streets than from crime.\n\nJan2019: Be aware of boat/yacht customs entrance fee scams BY THE LOCAL OFFICIALS!!! Before paying and handing in the money, mention that you will need a receipt for all payments IN THE CURRENCY YOU PAYED, PARTICULARLY IF THE OFFICER IS ALONE in the office. This issue has been observed at the customs/immigration office located (but not affiliated with) Le Phare Bleu Marina, but this may take place at other entrance points as well.\n\n==Stay healthy==\n\nThere is a General Hospital in St.George's, a smaller hospital at Mirabeau on the east coast and one in Carriacou.

If regularly dependent on dialysis, ensure in-advance that the type(s) offered meet your needs.\n\nHave fun, but use a condom! Local slogan - \"Don't be a fool, wrap your tool!\"\n\n==Respect==\n\nAlthough Grenada is a West Indian island in the Caribbean, Grenadians do not spend the majority of their time \"liming\" on the beach. They are very serious about their jobs and many workplaces require specially-tailored suits.  Though work remains, they rightly take well-deserved pride in widespread repairs to massive damage from hurricane Ivan.\n\nSt. George's Town is a place of commerce with the many banks, businesses, and governmental offices. Do not confuse it for the beach. It is often seen as rude or disrespectful for people to walk around Grenada inappropriately dressed, especially if you are dressed for the beach and you are not on it (Grenada just recently passed and is starting to enforce an indecent exposure law that bans bathing suits in non-beach areas as well as saggy pants that reveal underwear).  Do not confuse the laid-back attitude for lazy, as Grenadians have a very formal and conservative attitude about their lifestyle and workplace.\n\n==Contact==\n\n[[de:Grenada]]\n[[eo:Grenado]]\n[[fi:Grenada]]\n[[fr:Grenade]]\n[[hu:Grenada]]\n[[it:Grenada]]\n[[ja:\u30b0\u30ec\u30ca\u30c0]]\n[[nl:Grenada]]\n[[pl:Grenada]]\n[[pt:Granada]]\n[[ru:\u0413\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0430]]\n[[sv:Grenada]]\n[[wts:Category:Grenada]]\n\n\n[[WikiPedia:Grenada]]\n[[Dmoz:Caribbean/Grenada/]]\n[[World66:centralamericathecaribbean/thecaribbean/grenada]]\n\n{{isPartOf|Caribbean}}\n{{outline}}\n{{countryguide}}"

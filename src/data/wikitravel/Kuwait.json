It is located at the head of the Persian Gulf, with [[Iraq]] to the north and west, and [[Saudi Arabia]] to the southwest.\n\n==Cities==\n[[Image:Kuwait towers.jpg|thumb|240px|Kuwait Towers, Kuwait City]]\nKuwait City, Salmiya, Jahra and Wafrah are the main destinations in Kuwait.\n\n[[Image:Map of Kuwait.png|thumb|400px|Map of Kuwait]]\n*[[Kuwait City]] - the capital\n*[[Jahrah]] - 30 minutes - A town north of Kuwait City with great historic importance. Fires caused by faulty wiring well-known.\n*Ahmadi- 30 minutes - Many of Kuwait's oil refineries are located here.\n*Hawalli - 20 minutes - Important residential area\n*Farwaniyah - 20 minutes - Important port in Kuwait\n*Mubarak Al Kaber - 25 minutes\n*[[Salmiya]]- 15 minutes - Known for its beaches and host high-end real estate. Inner blocks are residential areas of lower cost.\n* Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh - 25 minutes - Very cheap housing. Residents are mostly Indian blue-collar and semi-blue collar workers. Poor sanitation and plumbing.\n* Riggae: A quiet and cleaner alternative to Jleeb.\n\n==Other destinations==\nWafrah and chalets are common getaways for Kuwaitis and residents. Wafrah (113km away from Kuwait City) is basically farmland. Chalets are beach houses in Khairan and Bnaider, where Kuwaitis enjoy beach culture, yachts and participate in water sport activities like scuba-diving. Most Kuwaitis own chalets although some chalets can be rented. Failaka Island has a diverse climate from the rest of Kuwait. Before the war, Az-Zawr, the town on the island was heavily inhabited but after the war the town was destroyed and very few people live there. There is a heritage hotel there now. Ferries can be taken from Kuwait City and Salmiya.\n\n==Understand==\n\n===History===\nKuwaiti people originate from Arabia, Iran and Iraq, although a small minority of Kuwaitis trace their origins back to Africa and India. \n\nBy 1752, the long term residents of Kuwait called for the establishment of a stable government. Kuwait soon rapidly became the principal centre of commerce in the region, attracting merchants. Kuwait was established as a harbour city for merchants. \n\nMubarak I signed an agreement with the British making Kuwait a British Protectorate in 1899. The British were in Kuwait for quite a while by then, and as early as the 1770's Abdullah I had a contract with the British to deliver mail for them up to [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]]. The agreement gave the British control of the Kuwaiti foreign policy in exchange for military protection. \n\nIn 1938, oil was first struck at the Burgan oil field in Kuwait, and by 1946, they started exporting it. \n\nIn 1961, Kuwait nullified the treaty of 1899, and became an independent nation. \n\nThe Kuwait Governorate (Arabic: \u0645\u062d\u0627\u0641\u0638\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0648\u064a\u062a\u200e) was the 19th governorate of Iraq established in the aftermath of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August 1990. It was preceded by the brief puppet state of the Republic of Kuwait. Following several weeks of aerial bombardment, a US-led UN coalition began a ground assault on 23 Feb 1991 that completely liberated Kuwait in four days; 26 February is celebrated as Liberation Day. Kuwait spent more than USD5 billion to repair oil infrastructure damaged during 1990-91.\n\n===Climate===\nThe whole of Kuwait is a dry desert with intensely hot summers and chilly and windy winters;\n\n===Terrain===\nFlat to slightly undulating desert plain. Highest point is 306m.\n\n==Get in==\n{{VisaRestriction|*Entry will be refused to citizens of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Israel]] and to those who show stamps and/or visas from Israel.}}\n\nCitizens of other GCC countries ([[Bahrain]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]) do not require a visa to enter Kuwait, and may use National ID Cards to enter the country. Residents of those countries who have certain job titles and meet other criteria are eligible for a visa on arrival as well.\n\nCitizens of [[Andorra]], [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Bhutan]], [[Brunei]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Cambodia]], [[Canada]], [[Cyprus]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Laos]], [[Latvia]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Malaysia]], [[Malta]], [[Monaco]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[San Marino]], [[Singapore]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[South Korea]], [[Spain]], [[Swaziland]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States of America]], [[Vatican]], and [[Vietnam]] may obtain a tourist visa on arrival to Kuwait if arriving by air. The visa duration and fee depends on the country of citizenship; for most countries the visa is valid for 3 months with a KWD3 fee, for other countries (including the United States) the visa is valid for 1 month but is free as of January 2019.\n\nTourist visas can either be obtained at the airport or applied for online in advance (an \"e-Visa\") at the [https://evisa.moi.gov.kw/ Ministry of Interior's e-Visa website]. For citizens of eligible countries, it is generally advisable to apply for the e-Visa if possible, if for no other reason than to skip the line at the visa issuing office at the airport.\n\nAll other nationals need advance visas, which require an invitation from a sponsor in Kuwait. Kuwait Airways offices and major hotels can provide invitations, but the process can take up to a week and may require a fee. The Embassy of Kuwait in [[Japan]] [http://kuwait-embassy.or.jp/english/k-j/visa.html] has some information.\n\nAlcohol is illegal and may not be imported into the country. \n\n===By plane===\n[http://www.kuwait-airport.com.kw/Index_e.htm '''Kuwait International Airport'''] ({{IATA|KWI}}) is served by several airlines, mostly flying within the Middle East.\n\nThe national airline, [http://www.kuwaitairways.com/ '''Kuwait Airways'''], serves [[Frankfurt]], [[Geneva]], [[Rome]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[London]], [[New York]] and [[Paris]] as well as several other European, Asian, African and Middle Eastern destinations, but is best avoided: a flag carrier with a poor reputation, its planes are old, delays are frequent, and customer service is weak. Although in recent years the Kuwait Airways management has introduced new planes such as the Airbus A320 along certain routes, the customer service is still lacking. During Ramadan, check-in meant to open during Iftar prayers will not open, and employees will not be at the check-in counter. Even if the ticket says it is open, check-in will open only 1 hour before departure. Because of this, flights become delayed, and return flights will be even more delayed.  In 2005 the Kuwaiti government supported two new airlines as part of its liberalisation programme: premium airline [http://www.wataniyaairways.com/ '''Wataniya Airways'''], and semi-low-cost carrier [http://www.jazeeraairways.com/ '''Jazeera Airways'''], which provides a popular alternative for regional flights. \n\nInternational airlines serving Kuwait include British Airways  from [[London]], Lufthansa from [[Frankfurt]], KLM from [[Amsterdam]], Singapore Airlines from [[Singapore]], Thai Air from [[Bangkok]] and Turkish Airlines from [[Istanbul]], plus connections through other large Gulf hubs ([[Dubai]], [[Doha]], [[Abu Dhabi]], etc) are accessible through Emirates Airlines, Qatar Airways, Etihad Airlines, Gulf Air and many other airlines, There are also some airlines that operate seasonal flights to Kuwait, including Malaysia Airlines, Ukraine International Airlines, Bulgaria Air and Czech Airlines. \n\n====Visa on Arrival====\nIf you need a '''visa''' on arrival at the airport, do ''not'' head down to immigration, instead look for the \"Visa Issuing\" desks, to your right opposite the Dasman Lounge. \n\nIf you have already been approved for an e-visa, use the kiosk to take a number for the \"evisa\" line. \n\nOtherwise, use the kiosk to take a number (use the \"visa\" button at the bottom), fill out a visa entry form, have your passport photocopied (either there will be an assistant there or you will have to do it yourself), and if you need to pay the KWD3 fee, get a stamp from the kiosks to your left. Payment for the stamp machines is accepted only in Kuwaiti dinar; there is an ATM next to the machines that will dispense KWD1 bills, and there are a number of bureaux de change in the arrivals area (the best rates appear to be for US dollars, Australian dollars and Euros). \n\nOnce you have gotten your visa issued from the desks, you will get an A4-sized sheet in Arabic and English, '''which you must keep''' -- this is your visa and will be checked upon leaving Kuwait. After going through the biometric scanning process, proceed downstairs to the normal immigration area. '''You do not have to queue at immigration.''' Just show your visa form at any desk and they'll let you through. Generally, you can pass through the open gate in the middle between the GCC Citizens line and the All Other Citizens line.\n\n====Getting into Town====\nAirport taxis can be found outside arrivals, with the fare to most points in Kuwait city being KWD5.  Most hotels can arrange a transfer for the same price if not free of charge, which is probably a safer and more comfortable option. When in operation, you can also use the \"limousine\" service which is located to the right of the outside exit for KWD6. These generally have a reputation as having much safer drivers than the airport taxis (driven by Kuwaiti nationals who usually do not observe posted speed limits and will even drive on the verge/shoulder at 140km/h). It is illegal for a regular taxi to pick up arrivals passengers at the airport so most will refuse to do so because of the fear of hefty fines and possible imprisonment or deportation.\n\nThere are also airport buses X1, X2, X3, and X4, run by Citybus, which run every 30-60 minutes between the airport and various parts of greater Kuwait City for KWD1. Information about the Kuwait City bus system is notoriously hard to come by, the best way to find route information might be [https://www.facebook.com/citybuskw/photos/a.168841303516613/444638022603605 a post on Citybus Kuwait's Facebook Page]. Additionally, Jazeera Airways [https://www.jazeeraairways.com/ride-and-fly.aspx offers a bus connection for its flights].\n\n\n[https://www.flydubai.com/en/destinations/airports/kuwait-airport '''Sheikh Saad Al Abdallah \u0650Airport''']\nSheikh Saad Al Abdallah \u0650Airport is situated in Farwaniyah, 16 km south of Kuwait City. Travel time is around 20 minutes by car from the city centre. Access is via the Airport Road and is well signposted.\n\n===By car===\nThe legal driving age in Kuwait is ''18''.\n\nKuwait shares its borders with only 2 nations - Iraq and Saudi Arabia. The political situation in Iraq is volatile currently, so it's advisable not to see that route. One can take King Fahad Bin Abdul Road (40) from Saudi to reach Kuwait.\n\n===By bus===\nThere are 3 bus lines in Kuwait: KPTC, City Bus, and KGL.\nKGL is the only one of the three that provides routes to other GCC countries, but visas will probably be an issue for non-GCC citizens. There are other long-distance bus services to [[Dammam]] and other points in Saudi, but you will of course need to have a valid Saudi visa.\n\n===By boat===\nScheduled ferries to and from [[Iran]] are handled in Kuwait by United Arab Group Services Co (UAG), phone +965 2245 8116. You will find the office inside the same building as the Kuwait Ports Authority in Ash Shuwayk. The ferries go twice a week from [[Ash Shuwayk]] in Kuwait City to Khorramsharh in Iran. Departure from Kuwait on Thursdays and Sundays. One-way tickets from KD33 (2018). Departure between 10-11am and the voyage across takes 5-6 hours.\n\nYou are requested to have your luggage weighed the day before departure. Although they do not mind if you just show up on the morning of departure.\n\nPorts and harbours:\n*Ash Shu'aybah\n*Ash Shuwaykh\n*[[Kuwait City]]\n*Mina' 'Abd Allah\n*Mina' al Ahmadi\n*Mina' Su'ud\n\n==Get around==\nKuwait has a good road system. All signs are in English and Arabic. The major north-south roads are effectively freeways numbered Expressway 30, 40, etc. These are traversed by increasingly widely spaced ring roads named First, Second, etc, making navigation fairly easy.\n\n'''Public Transport''': Kuwait's public transport is adequate with three companies (KPTC, City Bus and KGL) running dozens of routes in every major city. Waiting times for buses range from one minute for most frequent routes to fifteen minutes for less used routes. All buses are equipped with air-conditioners and usually one can find a seat without much trouble. Although, during peak hours (7-9AM, 2-4PM, 8-9PM) most routes are packed and public transport should be avoided for those seeking comfortable travelling. It must also be noted that although areas with expatriates majority are covered with many routes, Kuwaiti residence areas are scarcely connected with public transport buses and are reachable mostly by taxis only.\n\n'''Taxi''': These are recognisable by yellow licence plates and may be hired by the day, in which case fares should be agreed beforehand. Although most taxis have meters these are rarely used and one needs to negotiate a fare beforehand. Share-taxis are also available. Hailing taxis from the road is the most practical approach. However some sources have reported it was not advisable, particularly for females, and they recommend that taxis are booked in advance by telephone from a reputable taxi company. The cream coloured taxis are the cheapest, but also likely to be poorly maintained and possibly dangerously so, considering the general speed and size of the rest of the vehicles on Kuwaiti roads. Orange coloured taxis which used to be the most common type of taxis in till the 1970's, have completely disappeared from roads.\n\nA standard rate is applicable in most taxis, but those at hotel ranks are more expensive. Naive westerners routinely pay 2 to 5 times more than the standard rates which are typically KWD0.500 (500 fils) for up to a 5 minute ride plus about 100 fils (KWD0.100) per minute thereafter. The only exception being airport departures which are approximately KWD3. Tipping is not expected, however you should negotiate fares before boarding the taxi. It is customary to collect all baggage and exit the taxi before offering payment to avoid conflicts or loss of personal property should a taxi driver demand more than the agreed price after arriving at the destination. This way, the passenger can drop the money in the seat and walk away if necessary.\n\n'''Car hire''': Self-drive is available. If you produce an International Driving Permit, the rental company will, at the customer's expense, be able to arrange the statutory temporary insurance, which is drawn on the driver's visa.  If you arrive at Kuwait International Airport, you will find the car hiring companies located at your left after you exit from the baggage claiming area.  You can find international companies such as Avis and Budget among others.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that driving in Kuwait, especially when new to driving in the country, can be extremely chaotic and frightening.  Turn signals and lane divisions are effectively optional, speeding and aggressive driving is commonplace, and there is little active enforcement of traffic laws. Recently a law was passed to disallow the use of cell phones while driving (including but not limited to voice calls and text messaging or SMS.) If driving, ensure you keep out of the left hand emergency lane (often used as a fast lane) unless you are very relaxed about large 4-wheel drive vehicles tailgating you. \n\nIf involved in a car accident, do not attempt to move your car until police arrive and have made a report or you will be arrested.\n\n==Talk==\nArabic is the official language. In schools, the classical version of Arabic is taught, but the Kuwaiti dialect in everyday conversation. English is widely used and spoken and is taught at all of the schools and universities in Kuwait. All traffic signs in Kuwait are bilingual (English and Arabic). English is taught as a second language in schools in Kuwait from the first grade. Many Kuwaitis speak English fluently, as there are numerous private English and American schools and universities, where all subjects are taught in English, and Arabic is taken only as a subject.\n\n==See==\nSee [[Kuwait City]] for listings of attractions in the city.\n\nNote there has been a lot of tank graveyard/highway of death pictures floating around the internet recently, but those pictures are from 2006 and earlier and the place is now cleaned up. It is not possible to see the tank graveyard anymore.\n\nIf on a business trip, there are some sites worth seeing:\n* <see name=\"Al-Mubarakiya\" alt=\"\" address=\"middle of Kuwait City\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"latitude\" long=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" tags=\"\">Traditional-style Shops, Really need to visit.</see>\n\n* <see name=\"Sadu House\" alt=\"\" address=\"middle of Kuwait City\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"latitude\" long=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" tags=\"\">Historic house which turned into a museum.</see>\n\n* <see name=\"Bait al-Othman Museum\" alt=\"\" address=\"Hawalli\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"latitude\" long=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" tags=\"\">Museum about Kuwait's history, the museum was established through a historical house of Al Othman family.</see>\n\n* <see name=\"Kuwait Scientific Center\" alt=\"\" address=\"Kuwait City\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"latitude\" long=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" tags=\"\">Scientific center, includes IMAX cinema and museum.</see>\n\n* <see name=\"Museum of Modern Art\" alt=\"\" address=\"Kuwait City\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"latitude\" long=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" tags=\"\">Art museum housed in a historic pre-oil school, includes preserved classrooms.</see>\n\n* <see name=\"Failaka Heritage Village\" alt=\"\" address=\"knetmalou@hotmail.com\" directions=\"take KPTC ferry from Ras Al Salmiya (Ras al Ardh) near scientific center or private speedboat near Marina Mall\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"3 KD\" lat=\"29.430592\" long=\"48.270764\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" tags=\"\">A port with many old dhows, Failaka Island can be reached by regular ferry services.</see>\n\n* <see name=\"Mina Al Ahmadi\" alt=\"\" address=\"\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"latitude\" long=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" tags=\"\">Mina Al Ahmadi, lying 19km (12 miles) south of Kuwait City, is an oil port with immense jetties for supertanker traffic.

The best beach front hotels are the Hilton Resort, Movenpick Resort, Marina Hotel and the Radisson SAS. Hiring a boat should be done with caution and the boat should be inspected carefully for signs of neglect before agreeing on a rental. Many unwary tourists have been stranded at sea for hours while the coastguard ineptly attempts a rescue because like automobiles in Kuwait, mechanical maintenance is generally not a high priority for most boat owners.</do>\n\n* <do name=\"Shopping in Malls\" alt=\"\" address=\"\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\">The largest mall in Kuwait is The Avenues on 5th ring road behind road 60. It is one of the largest malls in whole middle-east and features a lot of clothing and electronics stores as well as a Carrefour and an Ikea. Furthermore it offers the best cinematic experience in Kuwait with VIP theatres with massaging reclining seats and a personal butler. Other popular malls include Marina Mall (Salmiya), Fanar Mall (Salmiya), Souq Sharq (Sharq), 360 mall (includes a 3D IMax cinema, located in Jinoob al Surra between 6th ring road and road 50) and Al-Kout Mall (Fahaheel) which is famous for its orchestra musical fountains. Hamra Tower has some restaurants. Clothing shops here are costly with prices exceeding KWD10,000.

See the buy section in the Kuwait City article.</do>\n\n==Buy==\nThe national currency is the ''Kuwaiti dinar'' symbolised as '''KWD''' placed before the amount with no intervening space.\n\nThe dinar is divided into 1000 fils.  Notes are available in denominations of KWD20, 10, 5, 1, \u00bd and \u00bc, while 100, 50, 20, 10 and 5 fils coins are also available.  While notes have Latin numerals on one side, the coins are entirely in Arabic.\n\nNotes issued '''before 1994''', many of which were stolen during the Iraqi occupation, are not considered legal tender.  You're unlikely to see these in Kuwait (the designs are clearly different), but unscrupulous dealers elsewhere have been known to try to pass them off.  See the [http://www.cbk.gov.kw/www/gallery_issues.html '''Central Bank of Kuwait'''] for pictures.\n\nExchanging money can be difficult, and exchanging travellers cheques even more so.  Stick to ATMs, which are ubiquitous and work fine.  Higher-end establishments accept credit cards. Many money changers can be found in the Safat market, who offer very competitive rates.\n\nNew notes have been issued on 29 June 2014. You can not deposit these notes in ATMs, and if you want to deposit them, it can only be done in banks.\n\n===Costs===\nAlthough Kuwait is a tax haven 0% VAT and 0% income tax  It would be hard to manage on under USD100 per day, and you can very easily spend USD200 just on an ordinary hotel room.\n\nTipping is generally not necessary.  A 12% service charge is tacked onto your bill in expensive hotels and restaurants, but if you want some of the money to actually go to the staff, leave a little extra.  \n\nPrices on common expenses:\n* Burger combo meal:  KWD1.50-2.00 (Hardee's)\n* Hotel breakfast: KWD6.00-7.50 (depending on how new the hotel is!)\n* Bunch of Bananas (~1 kg): 600 fils\n* Single-tall latte with an add-shot at Starbucks: KWD1.55\n* Falafel sandwhich in Hawally: 100 fils\nPetrol prices are one of the cheapest in the world and most of the time are cheaper than water, literally!\n\n===Shopping===\nKuwait is a tax free country. Custom-made items, imported items, and shipping out of the country can be expensive, so shop wisely.\n\n==Eat==\nThere is a huge array of restaurants in Kuwait. Because the nightlife does not involve drinking, people go out to restaurants and malls. Almost every cuisine is available in high-end restaurants. Kuwait is known for its culinary specialties and catering services.\nRestaurants can be found in food courts in malls, and alternatively many international restaurants are grouped together in certain areas in Kuwait, namely:\nBehind the Roman Catholic Church in Kuwait City\nOutside the Movenpick Resort in Salmiya\nIn the Marina Crescent\nJust ask any local where the \"Restaurants Road\" is and they will guide you to a road in Salmiya packed end-to-end with local restaurants serving a wide array of specialty sandwiches, juices and snacks.\nThere are few restaurants that serve traditional Kuwaiti food. Al-Marsa restaurant in Le Meridien Hotel (Bneid Al Gar location) has some traditional Kuwaiti seafood but with a relatively high price tag. A better option is the quaint Shati Alwatia restaurant at the Behbehani Villa compound in the Qibla area of Kuwait City (behind the Mosques)and another Kuwaiti restaurant is Ferij Suwailih in salmiya area.\n\n*<eat name=\"Chocolate Bar\" alt=\"\" address=\"Salmiya\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\"></eat>\n*<eat name=\"Dhaba Express\" alt=\"\" address=\"Salmiya\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"https://www.facebook.com/dhabaexpresskw/\" hours=\"11am-11pm\" price=\"Reasonable Price\" lat=\"\" long=\"\">Authentic Indian & Chinese cuisines</eat>\n*<eat name=\"Oriental restaurants & confectionaries\" alt=\"\" address=\"\" directions=\"\" phone=\"\" url=\"http://www.orientalkuwait.com/index.html\" hours=\"\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\">Indian, Arabic & Chinese cuisines.

Most of the large companies have high quality office facilities however expect to see a great portion of Kuwaiti businesses operating out of small 3 to 4 people offices. These businesses are normally owned by a Kuwaiti and staffed by Middle Eastern or Asian staff and don't normally hire nationals of western descent. If you plan to work in Kuwait be sure to check the academic requirements of desired positions as in most cases the Kuwaiti government insists on degrees from accredited universities.\n\nExpect to be paid anywhere from KWD250-600 for average middle range positions to KWD1000-1500 for higher positions such as teaching or consulting. Kuwait is heavily saturated with IT workers (mostly from India) and so wages in the IT industry are very low. If you are looking at accepting a job offer before coming to Kuwait be sure to check carefully how much you will be paid and if your employer will assist you with accommodation. It is commonplace for workers of Asian nationality to fall victim to promises of good pay and provision of accommodation only to find themselves having their passport confiscated and falling under the control of their sponsor. Be sure to check the reputation and credibility of any potential employer before accepting a position.\n\nAny foreign national wishing to work in Kuwait MUST have a working visa under a Kuwaiti sponsor. There is little provision for freelance work and foreign nationals found working without a working visa will be promptly apprehended and asked to leave resulting in a possible ban from returning. Freelance work(such as private tuition)is possible if you have acquaintance with an independent Kuwaiti sponsor which is unlikely if you are new to Kuwait.\n\n==Stay safe==\nThe crime threat in Kuwait is assessed as low. Beware of young Arabs pretending to be the police. They often ask for documents like passports or civil IDs, though they usually aim for resident Asians especially Asian woman. Homosexual sexual intercourse is prohibited and may lead to jail, cross dressing is illegal since 2010. Heterosexual intercourse outside marriage is also illegal and can be lead to a 6 months to 5 years (if the woman is above 21).\n\n==Respect==\n{{ramadandates}}\nKuwait adopts a live-and-let-live policy for clothing, and you'll see a wide range of styles: women wear anything ranging from daring designer fashions like tank tops and shorts to abayas, while men can be seen both in T-shirts and shorts or the traditional dazzling white ''dishdashah''. Bikinis are fine at the hotel pool and beach resorts.\n\nAlthough Kuwait is a democratic country with some of the best freedom of speech laws in the Middle East, the topic of overthrowing the Emir is beyond the red line. \n\nAlcohol is illegal in Kuwait and possessing or making alcohol for own use will result in a fine and if done in numerous times, you may go to jail. \n\nLike in all Gulf countries, do not eat in public during the month of Ramadan, you may be fined or imprisoned for a month. The fine is KWD100 ($350).\n\n==Stay healthy==\nPublic health is entirely supported by the government at local clinics and hospitals, with a KWD5(c. USD17.88) fee paid by foreigners visiting Kuwait and KWD1 (c. USD3.57) for expats with a resident visa, or a visitor's visa. Private non-governmental clinics are available as well, but charge much more at KWD30 (c. USD$107.31) and upwards. You will be entitled to free treatment in case of an accident or an emergency. In case of an emergency, call '''112'''.\n\n==Contact==\n\n===Phone===\nThe country code for Kuwait is '''965'''.\nLocal phone numbers are 8 digits long.  The numbering system is as follows:\nNumbers starting with 2 are landline telephones.\nNumbers starting with 5 are mobile telephones for the VIVA Mobile Operator.\nNumbers starting with 6 are mobile telephones for the OOREDOO (previously Wataniya) Mobile Operator.\nNumbers starting with 9 are mobile telephones for the ZAIN Mobile Operator.\nNumbers starting with 1 are service numbers.\n\n===Mobile===\nKuwait uses GSM/3G/3.5G/4G/LTE and mobile phones are widely available.  Major operators include '''Zain''', '''Ooredoo''', and '''Viva'''.  As roaming charges can be very steep, it makes sense to get a local SIM card: prepaid starter kits are available for around KWD2(c. USD7.00), including at least KWD 5 worth of call time. Access to VOIP services (e.g., WhatsApp call, Viber, etc.) is available in Kuwait and not banned like in the UAE or Saudi Arabia, so it's a practical options to stay in touch while in the country.\n\n===Internet===\nInternet kiosks are everywhere. The biggest ISPs in Kuwait are QualityNet, Fasttelco and KEMS. High speed internet is available via DSL subscription (upto 48Mbps)\n2mbps internet connection is free in Kuwait, anyone can sign up for it.\nInternet costs about KWD50 (c. USD176) for a year at 4mbps. This is in addition to the money you must pay to the MoC for a telephone landline.\n\nAnother recommendation is to try a relatively new service \"Mada\". This service is Wimax, up to 10mbps download speed, and no capping. the cost is KWD40 (c. USD140) for the main router and KWD20 (c. USD70) per month after the first 3 month period.\n\n===Telephone===\nCalls made from landlines to any other phone is free. Kuwait has high international call rates. Although calling overseas is also very cheap if you use the many booths that advertise 'Net2Phone' service, which is illegal. Basically it is calling over the Internet. For home usage, Phoneserve cards are available (mostly in Hawally) that can be used for cheap calls worldwide. Users with credit cards use Skype and Yahoo Voice for communication as well, but Skype website was banned now. \n\nSome traditional corner-shops commonly referred to as \"Bakalat\" sell an international calling card called Big Boss which offers good rates to Europe but only when calling landlines. For the rest of continents the rates are decent even when calling mobile phones. \n\n\n{{outline}}\n{{isPartOf|Middle_East}}\n{{Countryguide}}\n\n\n[[WikiPedia:Kuwait]]\n[[Dmoz:Middle East/Kuwait/]]\n[[World66:asia/middleeast/kuwait]]\n\n[[ca:Kuwait]]\n[[de:Kuwait]]\n[[eo:Kuvajto]]\n[[es:Kuwait]]\n[[fi:Kuwait]]\n[[fr:Kowe\u00eft]]\n[[hi:\u0915\u0941\u0935\u0948\u0924]]\n[[hu:Kuvait]]\n[[it:Kuwait]]\n[[ja:\u30af\u30a6\u30a7\u30fc\u30c8]]\n[[nl:Koeweit]]\n[[pl:Kuwejt]]\n[[pt:Kuwait]]\n[[ru:\u041a\u0443\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0442]]\n[[sv:Kuwait]]\n[[zh:\u79d1\u5a01\u7279]]\n[[wts:Category:Kuwait]]"

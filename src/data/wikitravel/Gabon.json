It lies on the Equator, on the Atlantic Ocean coast, between the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south and east, [[Equatorial Guinea]] to the northwest and [[Cameroon]] to the north.\n\nA small population, as well as oil and mineral reserves have helped Gabon become one of Africa's wealthier countries. The country has generally been able to maintain and conserve its pristine rain forest and rich biodiversity.\n\n==Understand==\n\n===History===\nThe earliest inhabitants of the area were Pygmy peoples. They were largely replaced and absorbed by Bantu tribes as they migrated.\n\nIn the 15th century, the first Europeans arrived. The nation's present name originates from \"Gab\u00e3o\", Portuguese for \"cloak\", which is roughly the shape of the estuary of the Komo River close to the capital of [[Libreville]]. French explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza led his first mission to the Gabon-Congo area in 1875. He founded the town of Franceville, and was later colonial governor. Several Bantu groups lived in the area that is now Gabon when France officially occupied it in 1885.\n\nIn 1910, Gabon became one of the four territories of French Equatorial Africa, a federation that survived until 1959. These territories became independent on August 17, 1960. \n\nSince independence, Gabon has been one of the more stable African countries. Autocratic President Omar Bongo was in power from 1967 until his death in 2009. Gabon introduced a multiparty system and a new constitution in the early 1990s that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and for reforms of governmental institutions. A small population, abundant natural resources, and considerable foreign support have helped make Gabon one of the more prosperous sub-Saharan African countries.  Despite being made up of more than 40 ethnic groups, Gabon has escaped the strife afflicting other West African states.\n\n===Climate===\nTropical; always hot, humid. During the months of June to September, the climate is a little cooler (20-25\u00b0C).\n\n===Terrain===\nNarrow coastal plain; hilly interior; savannah in east and south. Highest point is Mont Iboundji at 1,575 metres.\n\n===Important holidays===\n'''Independence Day''': 17 August 1960 (from France)\n\n'''National holiday''': Founding of the Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG), 12 March (1968)\n\n==Regions==\n[[Image:Gabon Regions map.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Map of Gabon with regions colour-coded]]\n\n{{Regionlist\n\n| region1name=[[Coastal Plain (Gabon)|Coastal Plain]]  \n| region1color=#b5d29f\n| region1items=[[Libreville]], [[Gamba]], [[Loango National Park]], [[Kango]], [[Mayumba]], [[Tchibanga]]\n| region1description=flat riverplains and lagoons with dense rainforest on the Atlantic coast as well the capital city and majority of the population\n\n| region2name=[[Central Highlands (Gabon)|Central Highlands]]\n| region2color=#71b37b\n| region2items=\n| region2description=the Cristal Mountains and Chaillou Massif with huge tracts of highland rainforest \n\n| region3name=[[Jungle Interior (Gabon)|Jungle Interior]] \n| region3color=#7e9a5b\n| region3items=[[Franceville]]\n| region3description=the eastern region mostly bordering Republic of the Congo; more rainforest.\n}}\n\n==Cities==\n*[[Libreville]] - Capital\n\n*[[Cap Lopez]]\n*[[Franceville]]\n*[[Gamba]]\n*[[Kango]]\n*[[Lambarene]]\n*[[Mayumba]]\n*[[Owendo]]\n*[[Port-Gentil]]\n\n\n==Other destinations==\n*[[Akanda National Park]] &mdash; mangroves & tidal flats are home to migratory birds and turtles.\n*[[Banteke Plateau National Park]] &mdash; savannah crossed by rivers with rope bridges for the locals; home to forest elephants, buffalo and antelope.\n*[[Crystal Mountains National Park]] &mdash; misty forests rich in orchids, begonias, & other flora.\n*[[Ivindo National Park]] &mdash; two of Central Africa's most magnificent waterfalls; gorillas, chimpanzees, & forest elephants gather around its rivers and waterholes.\n*[[Loango National Park]] &mdash; a 100km stretch of virgin beaches and adjacent rainforest, both scenic and a place to view leopards, elephants, gorillas, & monkeys on the beach.\n*[[Lope National Park]] &mdash; mix of savanna & dense forest along the Ogooue River; float along the river in pirogue, view ancient rock engravings, or track gorillas or mandrill monkeys with a pygmy guide.\n*[[Mayumba National Park]] &mdash; sandy peninsula home to the world's largest population of nesting leatherback turtles.\n*[[Minkebe National Park]] &mdash; highland forest with large sandstone domes, home to elephants and forest-dwelling antelope and giant hogs.\n\n==Get in==\n\nNationals of [[Morocco]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Tunisia]] may enter Gabon visa-free. Nationals of [[South Africa]] may obtain a visa on arrival. All other nationals must apply for a visa before travel.\n\nThe fee for a visa to enter the country is typically \u20ac70 via the e-Visa [https://evisa.dgdi.ga/ website] from one (1) to three (3) months single entry, \u20ac185 for six (6) months with multiple entries. Both have a \u20ac15 processing fee. Fees can also be paid in XAF. Payments are made on arrival at the delivery of the e-visa sticker. The visa usually takes 72 hours to be issued. This can only be issued when visit Gabon by air via Leon Mba International Airport in Libreville.\n\n===By plane===\nAir France and Gabon Airlines fly from [[Paris]] to [[Libreville]], and Royal Air Maroc flies from [[Casablanca]] to Gabon.

If you plan on venturing onto some of the unpaved roads outside the major cities a 4x4 is recommended. There are less than 800km of tarred roads in Gabon - some of them in a bad condition. During the rainy season it is difficult to travel outside the major city areas even in a 4x4 vehicle.\n\n===By train===\nThe Trans-Gabon railroad goes from Owendo (Libreville) to Franceville.

Hotel Olako arranges weekly boat transfers between Port Gentil and Ombou\u00e9 (close to Loango National Park), transfers take between 3 and 4.5 hours (depending on the type of boat and engine).\n\n==Talk==\n\nThe official language is '''[[French phrasebook|French]]'''. Around 80% of the population speak fluent French, and one-third of the population of Libreville speak French as their native language.\n\nOther than French, the three most common languages are Fang, Mbere, and Sira. Other languages are spoken by much smaller numbers.\n\nVery few people speak English in Gabon, so some knowledge of French is an asset.\n\n==See==\nTourist attractions in Gabon include beaches, waterfalls, national parks, ocean and inland fishing facilities and the Crystal Mountains.\n\n==Do==\nChez Beti - a small seaside safari camp near the village of Nyonie owned and operated by a French ex-pat.

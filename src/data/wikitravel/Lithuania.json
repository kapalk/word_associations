It has a Baltic Sea coastline in the west and is surrounded by [[Latvia]] to the north, [[Belarus]] to the east, [[Poland]] to the southwest, and [[Russia]]'s exclave, the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], to the west.\n\n==Understand==\n[[Image:Guard Of Honor in front of President Palace in Vilnius, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|240px|Honour Guard dressed in 11th century armour in front of President's Palace in Vilnius]]\nLithuania has been an active member of the European Union since 1&nbsp;May&nbsp;2004 and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 29&nbsp;March in that same year. \n\nLithuania is the only Baltic country with more than eight hundred years of statehood tradition and its name was first mentioned one thousand years ago, in 1009. Wedged at the dividing line of Western and Eastern civilizations, Lithuania battled dramatically for its independence and survival. Once in the Middle Ages (15th century), Lithuania was the largest state in the entire continent of Europe, where crafts and overseas trade prospered.\n\nIn 1579, Vilnius University, an important scientific and education centre of the European scale, was opened. In the 16th century, Lithuania adopted its First, Second and Third Statutes. The Statutes were not only the backbone of the legislative system, they also had a major impact on the legislation of other European states of the time. Despite losing its independence, Lithuania managed to retain its Third Statute in force for as many as 250 years, which was instrumental in the preservation of national and civic self-awareness. The Constitution of Poland-Lithuania together with the French Constitution, both adopted in 1791, were the first constitutions in Europe (The Polish-Lithuanian constitution was adopted a few months earlier than the French).\n\n===Climate===\nTransitional, between maritime and continental with wet, moderate winters and summers.\n\n===Terrain===\nLowland, many scattered small lakes, fertile soil. The fertile central plains are separated by hilly uplands that are ancient glacial deposits. 30% is covered in forest. The highest point is[http://www.virtualmountains.co.uk/esc/Lithuania/LI_Info.html Auk\u0161tojas Hill] at only 294m (967&nbsp;ft), about 24km southeast of [[Vilnius]] and lying just off the main highway to [[Minsk]] and within sight of the [[Belarus]] borders.\n\n===History===\n[[Image: Aerial view of Medininkai Castle.jpeg|thumb|Medininkai Castle: the upper construction of the walls was wooden and it was badly damaged by a major fire in the late 15th century.]]\nLithuania, first formed in the middle of the 13th century, was a huge feudal country stretching from the Baltic to the Black sea in the middle ages and in 1569 entered into a union with Poland to form a commonwealth.\n\nLithuania was part of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth until the Polish Partitions in the 18th century when it became part of the Russian Empire.\n\n===Independence===\nModern Lithuania gained its independence from Russia in 1918 following World War I and the dissolution of the Czarist monarchy. However, in 1940 Lithuania was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. On 11 March 1990, Lithuania became the first of the Soviet republics to declare its independence, but this proclamation was not generally recognized until September 1991, following the abortive coup in Moscow. The Soviet Union recognized Lithuania's independence on 6 September 1991. A constitution was adopted on 25 October 1992. The last Russian troops withdrew in 1993. Lithuania subsequently has restructured its economy for integration into Western European institutions.\n\n===National Holidays===\nThere are State Holidays which all are days off by law, and there are red letter days which usually are regular weekdays honored or celebrated in different ways.\n\n====State Holidays====\n*'''New Year's Day''' (1 Jan) \u2014 typically starts in the evening of previous day (the last day of a year) like a private party; then, closer to a midnight, people go to the street or square to \"meet the New Year\" in a crowd. Depending on whether the winter is cold or mild, celebration is either enthusiastic or rather formal. The rest of day is spent like a regular weekend.\n*'''Independence Day''' (16 Feb) - independence from Russian Empire in 1918 following World War I. Officially celebrated with all the ceremonies.\n*'''Restitution of Independence''' (11 Mar) - restoration of independence from the Soviet Union. Focus on national consciousness and both national and universal values emphasis. Usually various political and cultural debate are organized at various levels and broadcast live across the country. Some official ceremonies take place as well.\n*'''Easter''' (Sunday and Monday in March or April) \u2014 Catholic religious holiday.\n*'''International Labor Day''' (1 May) \u2014 political holiday, mostly spent like a regular weekend.

Despite its Christian name, celebrated mostly according to Pagan traditions (Midsummer's Day), thus often is called by its ancient name ''Rasos'' (Dew Time).\n* '''Statehood Day''' (6 Jul) - commemorates the coronation in 1253 of ''Mindaugas'' as the first and only King of Lithuania (later rulers of Lithuania were called Grand Dukes). Officially celebrated with all the ceremonies. Additionally, various events with the historical trend are organized and enthusiastically attended: reenactments, jousting, live archaeology events, various concerts. If weather is good there may be traffic jams on all highways closer to the coast. \n*'''Assumption Day''' (15 Aug) \u2014 superposed and virtually merged with the Pagan holiday called ''\u017dolin\u0117'' (Flower Time). It is harvest time when medical herbs, flowers, vegetables and cereals used to be processed through the special rituals during Pagan times, and later they used to be sanctified in churches by Catholic priests. Various Christian and Pagan events are organized in tradicional locations.\n*'''All Saints' Day''' (1 Nov) \u2014 time to remember loved ones. Although it is a Christian holiday, traditionally it is perceived as an Eve of All Souls' Day and superposed with customs of ancestor veneration, often in Pagan manner. May be traffic jams everywhere near any cemetery.\n*'''Christmas Eve''' (24 Dec) \u2014 considered main holiday of a year. Celebrated at home, families and close friends exchange gifts; Pagan-style observances. Almost everything (business and offices) is closed. \n*'''Christmas''' (25, 26 Dec) \u2014 smooth continuation of the Christmas Eve. Almost everything (business and offices) is still closed. Religious people attend churches.  \n\n====Red Letter Days====\n*'''Day of Freedom Defenders''' (13 Jan) \u2014 commemoration of January Events in 1991.\n*'''Shrovetide''' (46 days before Easter, usually in February) - celebrated the closest weekend before the actual Shrovetide Tuesday, then the Tuesday is commemorated by eating pancakes.\n*'''(Saint) Valentine's Day''' (14 Feb) \u2014 a popular commercial holiday of romance and love. Most restaurants are crowded; advance reservations usually are required.\n*'''Saint Casimir's Day''' (4 Mar) \u2014 anniversary of the death of Saint Casimir, the patron saint of Lithuania. Time for the biggest fairs all over country and especially in Vilnius. Central streets of city are closed for all kinds of transport, everything alloted for vendors.\n* '''Mourning and Hope Day''' (14 Jun) - for remembrance of whose who were exiled to Siberia by Soviet authorities. Remarks the anniversary of the first June deportation in 1941. Some official events and ceremonies usually take place.\n* '''Black Ribbon Day''' (23 Aug) - commemoration of the victims of totalitarian regimes. Political events and debates often are organized in a manner that attract public interest.\n* '''Balts Unity Day''' (22 Sep) - commemorates 22 Sep 1236 when the Samogitians and the Semigallians defeated the Knights Of Sword. Various events are organized, especially in Semigallia and eastern Samogitia. Most of events take place near and on the hill forts which are common places alloted for such kind of events all over the country.\n\n==Regions==\nRegional differences of Lithuanian culture reflect the complicated historical development of the country. Since the thirteenth century five ethnographic areas, or regions, have historically formed in the current territory of Lithuania:\n\n{{Regionlist\n| regionmap=Lithuania regions map for article.png\n| regionmaptext=\n| regionmapsize=upright=1.7\n\n| region1name=[[Auk\u0161taitija]]\n| region1color=#e0979d\n| region1items=\n| region1description=Literally Highlands, northeastern and eastern region.\n\n| region2name=[[\u017demaitija]]\n| region2color=#9ac8a1\n| region2items=\n| region2description=Samogitia, literally Lowlands, north-western region.\n\n| region3name=[[Dz\u016bkija]]\n| region3color=#94b6ba\n| region3items=Dainava\n| region3description=Southeastern region.\n\n| region4name=[[Suvalkija]]\n| region4color=#dcb278\n| region4items=S\u016bduva\n| region4description=South-western region.\n\n| region5name=[[Lithuania Minor]]\n| region5color=#e0e59d\n| region5items=\n| region5description=Sea-coast region.\n\n}}\n\nThese ethnographic regions even today differ by dialects, ways of life and behaviour styles, while until the turn of the last century there were pronounced differences in dress and homestead styles as well as village planning.\n\nLithuania is justly proud of its unfailing treasures of folklore: colorful clothing, meandering songs, an abundance of tales and stories, sonorous dialects and voluble language. This ethnographic heritage is nourished by ethnographic and folklore companies and barn theatres. Recent years have witnessed the revival of ethnographic crafts and culinary traditions. Folk craft fairs and live craft days are organized during many events and festivals.\n\n==Cities==\n[[Image:Inside the train in Vilnius, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|Passenger train interior, there also are older type and compartment-type cars in the same train.

Kaunas airport also has a direct link with [[Warsaw]] by LOT. \n\nFor destinations in Northern Lithuania, [[Riga]] Airport is an attractive option.\n\n===By train===\nThere are train connections to [[Vilnius]] from [[Minsk]], [[Moscow]] and [[Kaliningrad]]. \n\nThere are weekend trains from [[Kaunas]] to [[Bia\u0142ystok]] that are also connected with trains to [[Vilnius]] and [[Warsaw]].\n\n[[Image:Via Baltika Kaunas.jpeg|thumb|Via Baltica passing Kaunas' suburbs]]\n\n===By car===\nMajor \"[[Via Baltica]]\" road links [[Kaunas]] to [[Warsaw]] and [[Riga]]/[[Tallinn]]. The Baltic road, which links Vilnius to Tallinn, was just reconstructed. It is a very easy and pleasant route.\nOverall, the major roads between the cities are of decent quality. Be extremely cautious when getting off the main roads in rural areas, as some of them may contain pot holes and general blemishes which could damage a regular car if you go too fast.\nWhile driving between cities there are usually cafes and gas stations with bathrooms and snacks.\n\n===By bus===\n* [http://www.busturas.lt Busturas]\n* [https://ecolines.lt ECOLINES]\n* [http://www.eurolines.lt Eurolines]\n* [http://www.kautra.lt/ Kautra]\n* [http://www.luxexpress.eu/lt Lux Express ''and'' Simple Express]\n* [http://www.polskibus.com/ Polski Bus]\n\n===By boat===\nThere are several passenger/car ferries from [[Klaipeda]] to [[Sweden]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]]. See [http://www.dfdsseaways.lt/ DFDS Seaways]\n\n==Get around==\n[[Image:Lazdenai railway stop.jpeg|thumb|Lazd\u0117nai train stop at the edge of Neris Regional Park, an outdoor recreation area]]\n\n===By train===\n[http://www.litrail.lt/ Litrail] has services to major cities in Lithuania as well as to some small towns and villages which are difficult to reach by other public transport (eg popular holiday/weekend destinations in Dz\u016bkija and Auk\u0161taitija National Parks, Neris Regional Park and, [[Kretinga]] town, a final stop for those who are travelling to [[Palanga]] seaside resort by train). Fares are low compared to Western Europe: Vilnius-Kaunas costs about \u20ac5.20, with Vilnius-Klaip\u0117da at approximately \u20ac15.\n\n[[Image:Marijampole railway station.jpeg|thumb|Marijampol\u0117 railway station (built in 1924)]]\nMany of the long distance trains have compartments which can accommodate six seated passengers or four sleeping passengers. The headrest can be lifted up to form a very comfortable bunk bed, which can be used while people are seated below. The seats themselves form the other pair of beds. As some journeys are quite long (about 5h in the case of [[Vilnius]]-[[Klaip\u0117da]]), it is common to see people sleeping on the upper bunks during daytime journeys as well.\n\nGenerally the railway network is not considered as an alternative to the road network as it does not exactly duplicates the roads. As a result some places are more convenient to reach by train, some other places by bus, even if the railway and the highway are not far apart. Examples of the destinations which are more convenient to reach by train: Ignalina, a main point where the trip to Auk\u0161taitija National Park begins; Kaunas' eastern part around the dam where several recreation areas and tourist objects are situated (one have to get off at Palemonas suburb). This makes the question \"which one is better, train or bus?\" rather hard to answer because it depends on the specifics.\n\n[http://www.siaurukas.eu/ Narrow Gauge Railway] in Anyk\u0161\u010diai offers short trips to a near-by lake. In summer it runs on  regular schedule, rest of the time tours must be booked in advance.\n\n===By thumb===\n[[Hitchhiking]] in Lithuania is generally good. Get to the outskirts of the city, but before cars speed up to the highway speeds.  The middle letter on the older licence plates (with Lithuanian flag) of the three letter code usually corresponds with the city of registration (V for Vilnius, K for Kaunas, L for Klaipeda, etc.). Newer licence plates (with EU flag) are not bound to city of registration in any way.\n\n===By bus===\n[[Image:Lithuania bus stop road signs.jpeg|thumb|Bus stop road signs for the three types of buses that provide passenger transport services between cities.]]\nIn Lithuania it is easy to move by buses and in practice, all the bigger even a little places can be reached with buses. The buses usually run more slowly than where a Western has got used due to if it is not a question of Ekspresas, the bus stops at every stop exactly. To be more precise, there are two types of bus lines (see below) and three types of the bus stops: \"red\" stops for \"Ekspresas\" buses (very few, the journey with \"Ekspresas\" is quick), \"yellow\" stops for the regular intercity buses, and the \"blank\" stops for suburban buses (very frequent, the journey is slow). The color is a color of a road sign for the bus stop. For example 40km the trip by suburban bus can last thus an hour. Some buses are old cars that have mainly been brought from the Nordic countries, some are new ones, it is not predictable which one you will get. Practically, when you travel the time is most important factor and the best decision is to take the closest bus which runs in the right direction. \n\nThere is usually its own bus company on every town (district centre) and more than one company in the largest towns. Just to name few, [http://www.toks.lt/ TOKS] (long distance routes) and mini bus company [http://www.minibus.lt/tarpmiestiniai-marsrutai/ Transrevis] which will drive turns between [[Kaunas]] and [[Vilnius]], are based in [[Vilnius]]; [http://www.kautra.lt/ KauTra] (Kaunas Transport) additionally specializes in bicycle transfer service, though luggage compartments vary in size and not all types of bicycles always can fit in. The company offers the option to transport the bike to the agreed stop by the next bus with capacious compartment, informing you about the delivery by the short message to your cell phone. However, during the high season in summer popularity of this service is enormous, one should have that in mind if planning the trip by bicycle. [[\u0160iauliai]] company [http://www.busturas.lt/ Busturas], in addition to the regular routes, offers the tours to and from [[Riga]] ([[Latvia]]) via [http://rundale.net/en Rundale] which otherwise is inconvenient to visit from Lithuania. [http://www.klap.lt/ Klaip\u0117da Bus Fleet ''(Klaip\u0117dos autobus\u0173 parkas)''] is based in [[Klaip\u0117da]] and serves mostly the routes in the Western part of the country as well as some international routes. There are also several smaller intercity and suburban bus companies in all the cities mentioned above.\n\nFor university and college students with Lithuanian student ID or EU ISIC (international student card), bus companies grant 50% discount.\n\nThe bulk of Lithuania's [http://www.autobusubilietai.lt  bus routes] and turns have been listed in an address from which you also can reserve the tickets for certain routes. However, pay attention to the fact that the payment system supports only some of the Lithuanian banks for the present and the credit card at the moment does not suit. \n\nThe list above is only for the intercity buses, which generally is sufficient. There are two types of bus lines in Lithuania: intercity (''tarpmiestiniai'') buses and suburban (''priemiestiniai'') buses. This is reflected in the structure of the bigger bus stations, for example [[Vilnius]] bus station has two sections, a suburban \"blue\" one (blue color dominates in the timetables, destination plates on buses are written in blue) and a intercity \"red\" one (red colour dominates in the timetables, destination plates on buses are written in either blue or red). Thus, for example, \"Trakai\" direction has two platforms, a \"red\" one where intercity buses leave directly towards [[Trakai]], and a \"blue\" one where suburban buses leave to Trakai but run different routes, zig-zagging from village to village and finally arrive to Trakai. Similarly, at the Trakai bus station there are two platforms for \"Vilnius\" direction: blue one and red one. It is important to know that the \"red\" (intercity) bus always is faster. At the same time, intercity bus does not stop everywhere, for example the bus stop near the Hill of Crosses is for suburban buses only, if you wait there you can see many buses passing by but they won't stop there, you have to wait for a \"blue\" (suburban) bus. Schedules for suburban buses usually are put up separately from the schedules for intercity buses.     \n\nFor buses and trolley-buses on routes within towns and cities it is usual to buy the ticket from the driver. Recently the electronic ticketing has been introduced in major cities, but still the ticket can be obtained from the driver, though the types of tickets vary from town to town, for example in [[Vilnius]] you have to validate (stamp using one of the punches for paper tickets) the ticket obtained from the driver (thus you can buy several tickets and use them later), in other cities you get a one-ride ticket which already is valid for this particular ride. Inspectors periodically check tickets and will issue a fine if you cannot produce a correctly punched ticket or your electronic ticket is not valid. The bus is exited by the middle door and it is important to head for the door ''before'' the bus has stopped - it can be impossible to leave once people have started boarding; and if the driver sees that the bus stop outside is empty and nobody waits to leave the bus, the bus can skip the stop.\n\nIn addition to common buses run by municipality, many towns have private minibuses which usually operate express routes.\n\n===By taxi===\nTaxis run on a meter and can be booked by the phone numbers shown on the door of the taxi. Taxis are relatively cheap compared to western Europe. Some companies may not be as honest as others, common sense will keep you safe in this regard. It is common to ask about the approximate price to your destination in advance before boarding the taxi. If the answer does not satisfy you, you are not obliged to board this vehicle. Therefore, Lithuanians prefer to call the taxi by phone in order to know the price and the time of journey, and at the same time to be sure that the driver who will take them is aware of destination and the agreed price. However not all operators speak fluent English, nor drivers. On the other hand, people typically know more than one or two languages and know how to explain the relevant information without being fluent, this applies to drivers and passengers as only a minority of travellers from abroad are native English speakers.  \n\nTaxi can also be booked online. Be aware that some inaccuracies may occur as the infrastructure construction and renovation works are carried out in all largest cities, the works affect the traffic. Depending on your destination there may be a necessity to choose a longer way, compared to that which was calculated. If you suspect some dishonesty you must know all circumstances for sure before starting the dispute with company or driver, otherwise it is common that you will be simply ignored as unreliable customer.\n\nEach company has different prices, but roughly expect to pay around 30-75 cents/km. All taxis have also a fixed boarding fee in addition, so one should have that in mind before reaching any final conclusions.  \n\nTaxi prices are highly dependent on fuel price which is constantly increasing recently, therefore all the figures above should be interpreted as approximate.\n\n===By bicycle===\n[[File:Bicycle path along the old road to Trakai, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|Bicycle path along the \"Old Road\" to Trakai.]]\nCycling in Lithuania is quite popular, however it depends on the exact location as in major cities pavements usually will have a bicycle pathways with numerous signs, although getting around by bicycle in rural areas might become a bit of a challenge. Two international [[EuroVelo cycling routes]] across the country, [http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-10/countries/lithuania EuroVelo No&nbsp;10] and [http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-11/countries/Lithuania EuroVelo No&nbsp;11], the former one equipped with quality signs and is of excellent quality, the latter one requires to have a map. \n* '''EuroVelo-10''' leads along the coast from [[Curonian Spit]] in the south to [[Latvia]]n border in the north. Keep in mind that only on several occasion you are able to see the sea from the bikepath: usually you have to do a short detour to the beach itself in order to see the water. The beach is sandy, the sand is very fine and often powdery that makes riding the bicycle rather difficult or impossible. There are no roads or paths on the beach, the coast itself is a natural value and under the State protection, there are various restrictions on the development of infrastructure. Therefore the beach all along the sea retains its natural, sometimes genuinely pristine characteristics and appearance. The bike path is constructed slightly away from the sea, softly winds across the dunes and forests allowing to see the most interesting corners of the area.\n* '''EuroVelo-11''' crosses eastern part of the country from south to north, with the capital city [[Vilnius]] in the middle. The southern end is at Lazdijai border crossing point (N54\u00b09'25.88\" E23\u00b028'21.84\"); after entering the country you soon have to make a sharp turn to the south (before the lake, N54\u00b010'5.67\" E23\u00b028'39.13\") and ride along the border down the unpaved border track. This one was a part of Soviet Union external border zone infrastructure, now not in use for its intended purposes. There is a possibility to make a shortcut using a recently recreated ancient connection between Ber\u017cniki (PL) and Kap\u010diamiestis (LT) villages, border crossing point at N54\u00b02'46.49\" E23\u00b031'31.32\" (road No 2505) in the middle of a large Dzukian forest . You soon cross the same border track and proceed to ride to Kap\u010diamiestis.\n\nNorthern end of EuroVelo-11 bikepath crosses Latvian border at N55\u00b040'30.59\" E26\u00b034'59.98\" just before ''Grivo\u010dka'' hamlet on Latvian side.  Before the border the path is meaningfully winding across the pleasant environment among the lakes and hills and leads you through the town of ''Visaginas'' and village of ''Til\u017e\u0117'', both of unusual history, towards Latvian city [[Daugavpils]]. \n\nKeep in mind, that although it is possible to get from Vilnius to, say, [[Riga]], taking a road A2 which leads directly from Vilnius towards Riga, there hardly can be worse and more senseless decision as the road is designed specifically for cars across the flat and boring environment, away from any object that can distract the driver. It is equally true about all the other main roads.\n\nWhen staying in the country it is more common and reasonable to get to the certain region or area and explore it in more detail, rather than cycling across from one end to another. In the latter case, the most of time would be spent on roads that are friendly for cars and not very healthy for cyclists; distances between the outdoor recreation areas are rather long and not too scenic, whilst recreation areas, in contrast, are quite diverse and often puzzling. This adds attractiveness to recreation areas, but requires more time and flexibility, also some basic knowledge about the place itself.\n\nState Department of Tourism has issued a booklet for domestic needs with a description of 16 most attractive cycling routes all along the country. A downloadable [http://www.lithuania.travel/uploads/files/dir35/dir1/3_0.php English version of a booklet] introduce you to them and also supply with the maps of all of them. \n\n''Essential tip: don't leave your bicycle outside without locking it in, unless you are riding outside the settlements. Within any city or a smallest village always lock your bicycle, even if you are going to the store for cigarettes, even if you know for sure that your bike will constantly be in a field of view.''\n\nMore detailed information and help can be provided by the international bicycle project [http://www.balticcycle.eu BaltiCCycle]. It also can give you ideas about the other and more sophisticated routes in different regions of the country or within the cities that are not described in the booklet or elsewhere. Lithuanian version of this website, [http://velovilnius.lt/veloland/marsrutai/ Veloland.Lt], can be investigated using online translator \u2013 what you need to find there is the detailed maps of the routes (you have to select the region first from a drop-down menu ''\u201cMar\u0161rutai\u201d''). Many of the routes are remote but, surprisingly, often accessible quite easily and are no less attractive than more popular ones. For example, [http://velovilnius.lt/veloland/files/2013/02/3trasa.pdf this downloadable map] describes a 35km/5h route in a very attractive area of Dz\u016bkija forest: the starting/ending point is in Marcinkonys village which can be reached from Vilnius by train, the bikes can be brought with you or hired in advance at Marcinkonys itself.\n\n===By car===\n[[Image:2009-01-08 Blizzard on the A1 road.jpeg|thumb|Blizzard on the A1 road between Vilnius and Kaunas]]\n[[Image:Road No 130 in October 2011.jpeg|thumb|Road Kaunas-Prienai in October]]\nLithuanian traffic moves on the right and, as with most of the world, all distances are posted in km.\n\nHeadlights are mandatory and must be kept on at all times when driving.\n\nWearing the seat-belt is mandatory for both driver and passengers.\n\nA vehicle is required by law to stop at a zebra crossing if there is a pedestrian who obviously is going to cross the street but still didn't step from a sidewalk.\n\nThe alcohol limit is up to 0.4\u2030 for the drivers who have at least 2 years of driving experience of category B vehicle; 0.0\u2030 for others.\n\nThe road network in Lithuania is fairly good, especially the motorways. The quality of road surface on minor roads can vary. The improvement work hampers traffic in many places. The [[Via Baltica]] road goes through Lithuania from south ([[Poland]]) to north ([[Latvia]]). Other important roads are the A1 (Vilnius-Klaip\u0117da) and the A2 (Vilnius-Panev\u0117\u017eys).\n\nThe A2 (European route code E272) road has motorway status with 130km/h speed limit during summer and 110km/h during winter, the road length is 136km. There are 6 spots along the road where the speed is reduced from 130 to 110 km/h: the U-turns with separate deceleration lanes are constructed there. These are needed for sparse local inhabitants and emergency services, while regular traffic is not supposed to use them.\n\nThe A1 (European route code E85) is the longest (311km) highway in the country, completed in 1987. Its western section between Klaip\u0117da and Kaunas has motorway status with 130km/h speed limit during summer and 110km/h during winter, and its eastern section between Kaunas and Vilnius has expressway status with 120km/h speed limit during summer and 110km/h during winter. It is planned that this section too will be given the status of the motorway in c. 2018, when the installation of connecting roads and overpasses and the reconstruction of individual stretches of this section will be fully completed. There are two relevant U-turns left on this road: one at the western edge of Vilnius, another one at the western edge of Kaunas.\n\nMost of the other highways and regional roads have 1+1 lanes and a 90km/h speed limit outside settlement limits. Within settlement the speed limit usually is 50km/h.\n\nMoving domestic animals and roe animals may cause dangerous situations on the rural roads. The motorways are almost entirely fenced up to protect from wild animals, secondary roads have the signs warning about possibilities of such collisions. Drivers who are not used to that must be ''very'' alert as collisions with elks, although rare, may be lethal. Potentially the most dangerous time, when even the fence can succumb, is in May and October, between 18:00 and 01:00.\n\n[[File:U turn lane on motorway A2, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|Deceleration lane before the U-turn on the A2 motorway near ''Raguva'' village.]]\n\nFixed speed cameras are frequent along country roads and motorways, usually near crossroads or pedestrian crossings, and in cities. These are usually announced by a sign. Many of them appear to be designed to be turned around from time to time, watching the opposite direction.\n\nRoundabouts are a feature of the Lithuanian road network, particularly in the cities. Recently many small (or \"midi-\") roundabouts were installed at the crossroads of regional roads. Visitors from countries where this type of junction is uncommon or not used at all, may find the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout Wikipedia article on roundabouts] useful.\n\n'''In the cities:''' unlike many European countries, but similar to North American practice, turning right at a red traffic light is allowed ''where indicated by a \"green arrow\"'' (square white sign next to the red light, containing a green arrow indicating the permitted direction), after a full stop and provided that it does not endanger pedestrians and other traffic. Be aware that the absence of such a sign means that turning right on red is not allowed, and the police will stop any driver seen breaking this rule. It is scheduled to remove all \"green arrows\" until 2020, while gradually installing the smart traffic lights. \n\nMany bigger city junctions have a separate green light for traffic turning left, but no red light. The green light for the other directions shows arrows going straight and to the right, but you need to look closely to make them out.\n\nTraffic rules equally apply to both pedestrians and drivers, therefore the pedestrian violator has no advantage over the vehicle driver. This especially is relevant in cities: if you walk on a carriageway part of the street, you have to be alert and leave this part of the street if the car is approaching, otherwise it's your fault if accident happens.\n\n'''Driving:''' on two- or three- lane roads, it is polite to move out of the right-hand lane (if safe to do so) when you intend to travel straight ahead; this keeps the right-hand lane clear for right-turning traffic. When moving back to the right hand lane watch out for fast-moving vehicles approaching from behind.\n\nOn 1+1 lane highways without barrier be careful of the overtaking cars: the driver behind you may suddenly find the oncoming car is coming too close and decided to get back to your lane - you have to predict that. You are supposed to keep the speed and move a bit to the right so that the car behind could see what's in front of him clearly, and he will overtake you when it's feasible. When driver overtakes you, he wants to get back to the lane as fast as possible, and this may seem as if he is tailgating you. Keep calm, it's not hostility.\n\n==Talk==\nThe official language of Lithuania is [[Lithuanian phrasebook|Lithuanian]], making up one of only two languages (along with [[Latvian phrasebook|Latvian]]) on the Baltic branch of the Indo-European family. Despite the kinship of Lithuanian to many other European languages, the archaic nature of its grammar makes it hard for foreigners unfamiliar with the language to form even basic sentences. \n\nEnglish is generally well spoken and preferred foreign language by the younger generations. The older generations might have just the very basic spoken English skills and it be especially difficult for them to understand strong English accents (written English might help). Most people of the older generation know Russian (this is not necessary the case amongst the youth, who might know only very basic Russian), especially in Klaip\u0117da, Vilnius and eastern districts of the country. Polish is somewhat understood in certain areas of Vilnius as well as south-east and southern districts of the country. German is spoken or understood better than elsewhere in Klaip\u0117da, Neringa, Palanga and \u0160ventoji. Keep in mind that all this is just a generalization and should be not applied blindly. For example, if you're in Vilnius and the young person you try to talk to in English language can't understand you and shakes his head, it does not mean that information provided above is inaccurate. You can't know all specifics: this young person may be a student who arrived from the northern district of the country where the French traditionally is taught as a foreign language at schools. He may not know English or can't understand your pronunciation. There may be elderly person just next to you who may be fluent in English only because he or she worked in UK for several years. This applies countrywide: communication skills in foreign languages depend on the person and vary greatly. Differences and specifics by regions and cities are provided above, it means that chances to communicate in one or another language are greater in a corresponding region or city. Whether you will be understood depends on concrete person and your pronunciation. Those travelers who learn a few basic phrases of the local language are always amply awarded with good will and appreciation for their efforts, however sometimes it may be tricky: if your accent makes those local phrases unrecognizable you probably will be awarded blank face and a shy smile. \n\nIn case you managed to master some spoken Lithuanian, it may be extremely beneficial if you have any long-term or deeper interests. Just be prepared, that you will be learning the so called Standard Lithuanian, understood by all. However if local people respond in a local dialect you may understand nothing, especially outside the largest cities. You have then to say: I'm from city, I have only learned the \"city Lithuanian\" - and the wide smile on local person's face will testify that you are on a right way.\n\nIn case you're quite indifferent to national identities, simply remember that you are in Lithuania, not in a Russian colony and no longer in the Soviet Union: Lithuanians won't appreciate your efforts to stress your indifference.\n\nForeigners interested in reading English news can access [http://en.delfi.lt/ the Lithuania Tribune] (which is a part of ''Delfi'', the most successful online news portal in the Baltic states) and [https://www.facebook.com/VilNews VilNews] (photos & short stories related to everything Lithuanian). \n\n==See==\n[[Image:Frozen lake in Trakai.jpeg|thumb|Frozen lake in Trakai]]\nThe most southern of the Baltic countries, Lithuania's historic heritage sets it quite apart from the other two. Visiting this small but colourful country today, few travellers might guess that this was once the largest nation in [[Europe]]. A few monuments remind of those golden ages, when the Grand Duchy of Lithuania stretched out far into modern day [[Russia]], [[Poland]] and [[Moldova]], but even fewer are still inside the Lithuanian borders. The archeologic site of '''[[Kernav\u0117]]''', long ago a medieval capital, is now a World Heritage Site and has historic hillfort mounds as well as a museum. The '''Trakai Island Castle''' in [[Trakai]] is sometimes called \"Little Mari\u00ebnburg\". It's located on an island and was one of the main strongholds in the prime days of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Although it was severely damaged in 17th century wars with Muscovy, the castle was beautifully restored in the 20th century and is now a popular tourist sight. '''Kaunas Castle''' in [[Kaunas]] is even older, but only a fourth of the original building remains.\n\nThe country's lovely capital, '''[[Vilnius]]''', is a small but pleasant place with a UNESCO listed historic centre. It's the perfect place to admire a range of '''architectural styles''', as it boasts a mixture of gothic, renaissance, baroque and neoclassical buildings. Stroll through the narrow streets and cosy courtyards and kick back for a coffee in one of the many caf\u00e9s on Pilies Street. Then, walk down Gediminas Avenue, the town's main street lined with governmental buildings and theatres, towards the old neighbourhood of '''\u017dv\u0117rynas'''. With some 65 churches, the famous '''Gediminas Tower''', the '''Cathedral Square''', the '''Royal Palace''', the '''Presidential Palace''' and many other monuments and museums, you won't run out of things to see in Vilnius any time soon.\n\nFor a day at the sea, the popular seaside resort of '''[[Palanga]]''' is the place to be. Although it gets crowded in summer, it has some great beaches and beautiful sand dunes. Sand dunes overgrown with pine forest is also what you'll find at the almost 100km long '''[[Curonian Spit]]''', which separates the Curonian Lagoon from the Baltic Sea coast. It's a World Heritage Site shared between Lithuania and Russia and is best explored from the large port city '''[[Klaip\u0117da]]''', though there is a possibility to stay on the Spit itself in one of the four fishermen villages. Not far from Klaip\u0117da is the village of Juodkrant\u0117, which is famous for its '''Hill of Witches''', decorated with sculptures from the country's legends and tales. Farthermost on Lithuanian half is the fishermen's town of [[Nida]], it is praised for its shores, ancient ethnographic cemetery and high sand dunes in vicinity. Klaip\u0117da is also a good hub to other seaside resorts on the Baltic Coast, less known but equally cosy, such like Karkl\u0117. Nice bicycle path stretches north and south from Klaip\u0117da, as well as along all Curonian Spit. \n\nA few kilometers from the northern city [[\u0160iauliai]] you'll find the remarkable '''Hill of Crosses''', which is an extraordinary and popular pilgrimage site. Over a 100.000 crosses - small, huge, simple and exuberant - have been placed here by faithful from far and wide. On the other side of the country, in the very south, you'll find the popular and classy spa resort town of [[Druskininkai]], surrounded by largest pine forest in the country.\n\n[[Image:Minija river valley.jpeg|thumb|Forested valley of Minija river in [http://www.salanturp.lt/14526/salantai/zemelapiai.html Salantai Regional Park], Western part of Lithuania]]\n\nLike it's Baltic neighbours, Lithuania has a lot to offer for '''nature''' lovers. Dense forests, hills, beautiful blue lakes and rivers are the main base. The forested '''Auk\u0161taitija National Park''' is perhaps the most popular of the country's national parks for its balanced diversity of natural and cultural values. Its forests are home to elk, deer and wild boar. Some of the pines you'll see here are up to 200 years old and the park is a safe haven for many plants and birds that are endangered in the rest of the country. The 126 lakes and countless streams in between them make the park a great place for water sports activities and the villages in the park have some interesting wooden churches. Southwest from the national park lies a one of the largest forests, famous Labanoras Forest, which is a part of [http://labanoras.am.lt '''Labanoras Regional Park'''] - and there is more rare plants, more rare birds, including Black Stork, Capercailye, Crane and few species of eagles, more rare animals like Lynx and Wolf, 285 lakes (70 of them swimmable), mysterious swamps and numerous rivers and streams suitable for canoeing. No surprise that its popularity among holidaymakers exceeds even popularity of its neighbor Auk\u0161taitija National Park. \nAnother favorite regional park, especially among the birders, is the [http://www.nemunodelta.lt/ '''Nemunas Delta''']. The vast wetlands around the place where Neman River reaches the Baltic Sea are a popular eco-tourism destination and an important bird habitat.\n\n[[Image:Monkey bridge over Dituva rivulet, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|\"Monkey\" bridge over Minija river in Dituva village, south of Klaip\u0117da]]\n\n===Natural scenery===\nLithuanians describe their land with the help of poetry. Poetry and songs are filled with romantic images of gently rolling hills, vast valleys and meandering rivers, somber forests rich of animals, meadows full of butterflies and the birds singing in the sky. This embodies what the Lithuanian is looking for and is happy when he finds it. This is what the Lithuanian is willing to promote and defend. And when Lithuanians abroad begin to feel homesickness \u2013 this is homesickness for all such scenery and everything else related to it. This is, according to many Lithuanians, the highest value of the country. Consequently, if you are after all this, you can experience more than you had expected, however this can be quite a challenging experience. You have to be well prepared and probably to rent a car. You can see, hear and touch everything that is described in Lithuanian poetry and songs, but how you will perceive it depends on you and circumstances, which often are unpredictable. And this is a part of modern Lithuanian myths and urban legends as well: unpredictable circumstances. One of the first things that travelers from the West notice is the lack of infrastructure and facilities in the recreation areas. And there is no reason to expect any improvements or changes in this respect in the future: Lithuanians tend to make the difference between the \"urban habitat\" and the \"visits to the nature\", the latter is supposed to be a rough experience, a visit to the natural, not necessarily pristine or well maintained, but naturally strong and lively environment without the attributes of urban life, it should contrast with the daily routine of the city resident. Visiting the nature is supposed to be a way of gaining vital energy. Therefore you must to \"pave your path\" through the woods as if you were a pathfinder \u2013 each time again and again \u2013 so that ultimately you are affected by elements of nature even against your will or laziness. Locals would tell you that if you don\u2019t want to make any effort you don\u2019t deserve to step outside the city. But if some effort is not a big trouble to you, all those gently rolling hills, vast valleys and meandering rivers, somber forests, meadows full of butterflies and the birds singing in the sky are almost every time guaranteed.\n[[Image:Dainava wood in Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|right|Widely spread inland dunes, mostly forested, cover about 2.61% of the territory of Lithuania.

Traveling down the main roads is dull and boring. The roads, among other features, are treated as the objects that damage and pollute the natural environment; therefore the modern roads are built across the former pastures and agricultural lands, bypassing smaller settlements at \"respectable distance\", which means that you can barely see them from the road. Older roads, with reconstructed pavement, are also in use. For example, the motorway A1 [[Kaunas]]-[[Klaip\u0117da]] loosely duplicates the Samogitian Highway ''(\u017demai\u010di\u0173 plentas)'' which was opened in 1939, and which can be recognized as a winding secondary road connecting all the district centres slightly north of the road A1 on the section that begins before [http://www.ariogala.lt/miestas-2/ Ariogala] (NW of [[Kaunas]]) and ends up after [https://www.facebook.com/gargzdai Garg\u017edai] near [[Klaip\u0117da]]. To some extent such secondary roads are more diverse and more interesting, however the speed is lower and the time costs are higher. Some objects of interest are easy to miss, some others are still away from the road. Traveling by train reduces opportunities of sightseeing to a minimum: the rows of trees are planted along the railway tracks to form a green barrier in order to separate the railway infrastructure from the surrounding space. The rare breaks between the trees let to enjoy the scenery for several seconds or minutes. \n:There are several roads in the country that are scenic and pleasant to drive. Regardless of what objects are or are not on these roads, they can be treated as a separate objects of interest: all you need is just to relax and drive.

Total number of the hill-forts, or ''piliakalniai'' (nominative plural), in Lithuania is 840, the latest one was indentified in 1997.\n:There are several types of early hill-forts that date from the Bronze Age BC to 13th century AD, they all have flattened hilltop defensive positions; and two types of hill-forts built for defensive purposes against the raids of German Crusaders between 13th and 15th centuries, their hilltop defensive positions are irregular. The latter type of two is motte-and-bailey castles, for example the [http://www.piliakalniai.lt/piliakalnis.php?piliakalnis_id=123 Second Hillfort of Veliuona], now partially washed out by Nemunas river. Construction of castles and other elements of the fortifications were made of wood and stone, nothing has survived to date. Later the few brick castles were built, but by that time the firearms and new methods of warfare made such type of castles unsuitable for defensive purposes, they were abandoned and eventually only the hills remained. The scenery of Lithuania has changed: the settlements have \u201cclimbed down\u201d from the hilltops to the foothills and hid in groves. This is what you see driving through the rural areas: the road winding among the scattered groves, several farms here and there in a distance, and eventually you see the steeple of the church above the grove, betraying the presence of town still hidden behind the trees. Somewhere aside an old hill-fort marks its previous location. You can climb it up and the view that unfolds before the eyes often (but not always) is a literal embodiment of Lithuanian songs and poetry.\n:On the country\u2019s and regional maps the hill-forts are marked with an icon resembling the shape of some kind of a mound from the side or from above. The map legends are typically bilingual or multilingual, in Lithuanian language only the one term is used, ''piliakalnis'' (nominative singular), and English translations vary: hill fort, mound or castle hill means one and the same, the hill-fort. \n\n:Several notable hill-forts are widely known throughout the country, their names conclude the names of organizations, schools and companies, and of course they are in the spotlight of vacationists and organized excursions:\n[[Image:Medvegalis hill-fort in Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|right|Medv\u0117galis hill-fort, a highest point in Samogitia region.]]\n::[http://www.piliakalniai.lt/piliakalnis.php?piliakalnis_id=570 '''Kernav\u0117'''] \u2013 a complex of the hill-forts and archaeological sites.

At the top its diameter reaches up to 10m, the depth is about 19m, of which 7m is under the water. In the bottom of the sinkhole at the depth of 9.5m there is an underground cavity opened instead of melted gypsum; this cavity splits up into several caves that were explored by speleologists and cave divers from [[Kaunas]] in 1973 and 1978. There are five caves: ''the Wet Cave (\u0160lapioji ola)'', ''the Narrow Burrow (Siauroji landa)'', ''the Bat Burrow (\u0160ik\u0161nosparni\u0173 landa'' - several bats have been found here), ''the Toad's Cave (Rup\u016b\u017e\u0117s ola)'' with a small underground lake of about 1.5m depth and ''the Lustrous Cave (Blizganti ola)''.

A light fog, supposedly slightly toxic, tends to form early in the morning and in the evening. It is not recommended to stay for a long time at the bottom as you may start to feel yourself a little weird, though there is no official statistics or researches about the consequences of such an effect. Research conducted by Physics PhD's reveal that \"This is especially active place where intersects the structures of strong and diverse geological biofields\".

Oaks, although rather sparse, still grow in the area fulfilling the hearts of Lithuanians with warm feelings and chills\u2026. and probably making foreign guests to wander why.  If you stand on the top of the hill, and coincidentally hear the sound of bells in the D\u016bk\u0161tos church 4km away, you can feel that the hill echoes under your feet as if it was hollow.

It is known about the 600 mythological stones in the country. Their origins, shapes, purposes and associated legends vary. Lithuanian soils are unevenly podzolized, mostly fertile and cultivated, while sandy soils cover about one-fourth of the country\u2019s territory \u2013 you are supposed to make sure that Lithuania has no rocks, and even stones are rather rare birds. Majority of them partially or entirely rest beneath the ground, some protrude outward. And some are quite sizeable. These are well known and held in respect just as a cool natural phenomena, but among them there are stones which are something more than just that. Even in 19th until the middle of 20th century during Christian religious holidays many people used to gather by the mythological stones in large numbers, sacrificing various items and money, praying for health and happiness. Even today you can wing the sacred ''Bradeli\u0161k\u0117s Stone'' in ''Air\u0117nai'', Vilnius district, and you will always find the coins left on it. All regional maps have an icon \u201cmythological\u201d or \u201cprominent stone\u201d in the legend\u2019s section \u201cobjects of interest\u201d; the more detailed is the map, the more of mythological stones are marked on it. During short one or few days trips Lithuanians like to visit country's famous and mysterious places, and stones here go without saying. Such trips are done by combining various modes of transport, also on foot. Some even famous stones are quite remote or just are hard to locate, so attempts alone to find them are quite an adventure. \n\n<br/>'''There are different types of mythological stones'''; all of them have their given names. There are several large stones in different locations, called ''Mokas'', the name\u2019s meaning is a cross between a soothsayer and a scholar. It is supposed that the sorcerers and priests used to gain certain knowledge from them. Stones named ''Mokas'' possess some ancient wisdom, so what Lithuanians do is just visit them, or, like they say, \u201csee them\u201d. You don\u2019t need to do anything, ''Mokas'' will do what must be done, that is, your biofield will be (or will be not) affected in certain way, and whether you gain something entirely depends on your inner self. Apart those large stones there are many slightly smaller ones with attributed healing powers, it is supposed that healing effects can occur when there is a necessity. \n\n<br/>'''There are stones with pits'''. During 14-17 centuries the pagan shrines had in their sites the stones of cylindrical shape with engraved flat-bottomed bowls which gathered sacred water. It is supposed that the stones were also used to stoke a sacred fire. Later were prevailing the midsize flat surface stones with the pointed-bowls, it is believed they had to safeguard the grain, livestock and happiness of home. They now are sparsely scattered everywhere across the country, some can be found in the churchyards.\n\n<br/>'''A separate group is foot-printed stones'''. The truth is that they are lacking of scientifical data. Their origins are usually associated with minor goddesses and gods, such like woodland fairies - the ''Laum\u0117s'' (nom., plur., feminine) and devils - the ''Velniai'' (nom., plur., masculine). Other Baltic deities and elementals also may be involved, depends on particular stone and location. The ''Laum\u0117s Akmuo'' (Woodland Fairy Stone), for example, has several indentations of supposedly not artificial origin: the smaller ones remind the footprints of the fairy and the baby, the largest one, although sometimes is called a \u201ccow\u2019s footprint\u201d, is shaped rather like a devil\u2019s footprint. Here it is worth mentioning that Baltic devils were rather common creatures living in the woods and swamps throughout the country, you should not be mistaken by other definitions. One of the stories tell that the intendation was left by cow who managed to imprint it, another tale tells rather standard story about the devil who carried a stone and lost it. People were witnessing the woodland fairies washing clothes near the stone in the river, not only at night but even in day time. Once a local hireling girl saw a soldier who suddenly disappeared as soon as she crossed herself. Near the ''Laum\u0117s Akmuo'' on the other side of the river there is a Christian site of Lourdes, installed supposedly on the pagan sanctuary. The stone is located approximately 300m to the west of ''Kartena'' hill-fort with archaeological site of the ancient settlement which dates back to 600-1100 AD. Coordinates 55\u00b054\u203238\u2033N, 21\u00b028\u203215\u2033E, easily accessible by the A11 highway.\n\n<br/>'''Finally, there are cursed and turned to stone humans'''. Some of them probably are the echo of romanticized love stories, some others \u2013 who knows now - may be the outcome of the actual curse\u2026 At first the curse causes a sudden death, the next moment an actual sorcery comes into force: the inner self of a man is trapped into something solid that crystallizes and acquires the appearance of something that visually reminds a hard piece of the earth's crust. Lifeless body is buried in the cemetery or outside it, while the fate of trapped soul remains uncertain. Sometimes it haunts, sometimes it moves, and sometimes everything calms down.\n</see>\n* <see name=\"Tverai Sacred Site\" alt=\"\" address=\"\" directions=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" phone=\"\" tollfree=\"\" email=\"\" fax=\"\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\"> Tverai elderate, Rietavas district.

Some tended to Catholicism, others to Orthodox, and some were changing religions like clothes depending on trend. Finally, on 19 April 1389, Pope Urban VI recognized the status of Lithuania as a Roman Catholic state. A direct consequence of this was that German Orders lost any legal reasons to continue their crusades to Lithuania. Some say that Lithuania was forced to accept Christianity, some others can say that Christian Europe was forced to recognize Lithuania, but if the measure of progress is human life, then it was beneficial for all.\n*<see name=\"Vilnius University\" alt=\"(Vilniaus universitetas)\" address=\"Universiteto St 3, LT-01513 Vilnius\" directions=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" phone=\"+370 5 268-7001\" tollfree=\"\" email=\"infor@cr.vu.lt\" fax=\"\" url=\"http://www.vu.lt/lt/ \" hours=\" \"></see> Established as the Jesuit Academy of Vilnius by King of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth Stephen B\u00e1thory in April 1, 1579, complex of University buildings is one of the highlights of [[Vilnius]] Old Town.

Depending on place, chosen water route and preferences you can choose specifically canoeing, kayaking, boating or rafting.  \n\n[[Image:Canoeing in Minija2009-06-16.jpeg|thumb|Canoeing in Minija river near Raguvi\u0161kiai, Kretinga district.]]\n\n:Lithuanian terms:\n::'''raft''' \u2013 ''plaustas'' (nom., sing.) or ''plaustai'' (nom., plur.);\n::'''boat''' \u2013 ''valtis'' (nom., sing.) or ''valtys'' (nom., plur.);\n::'''kayak''' \u2013 ''kajakas'' (nom., sing.) or ''kajakai'' (nom., plur.);\n::'''canoe''' \u2013 ''baidar\u0117'' (nom., sing.) or ''baidar\u0117s'' (nom., plur.).\n\n:'''Rafting''' usually involves using inflatable rafts and is popular among lovers of passive recreation: fishermen who spend their time angling in the lakes, and groups of holidaymakers who are travelling down the largest rivers (''Nemunas, Neris, Nev\u0117\u017eis'' and ''\u017deimena'') in a low pace. \n\n:'''Boating''' is common everywhere in the countryside in all water bodies; homesteads of countryside tourism typically are equipped with boats that allow the visitors to enjoy the lake and scenery by slowly rowing the boat. This activity doesn't require much effort, is safe and suitable for all family members.\n\n:'''Kayak''' in Lithuania is mostly comprehended as a ''one seater whitewater kayak'' specifically. It is used for creeking in the fast-flowing rivers, particularly during spring tides. For example, river ''D\u016bk\u0161ta'' (incline 12&nbsp;m per&nbsp;km) every spring becomes almost like a mountain rivulet and is used by extreme sports enthusiasts to exercise before more serious expeditions. The list of other rivulets suitable for creeking in high tide period: ''Tenenys, Veivir\u017eas'' (both tributaries of ''Minija''), ''Lukn\u0117, Kirk\u0161nov\u0117, Gyn\u0117v\u0117''  (all 3 are tributaries of ''Dubysa''), ''Alov\u0117, Armena, Lapainia'' (all 3 are tributaries of ''Nemunas''), ''\u0160irvinta'' and ''Rausv\u0117'' (tributaries of ''\u0160e\u0161up\u0117''), ''Anyk\u0161ta, Armona, Indraja'' (all 3 are tributaries of ''\u0160ventoji''), ''Pla\u0161taka'' (tributary of ''Siesartis''), ''Bra\u017euol\u0117'' and ''Said\u0117'' (tributaries of ''Neris''), ''Nedzing\u0117'' (tributary of ''Merkys''), ''\u0160ventel\u0117'' (tributary of ''\u017deimena''), upper reaches of ''Venta''.\n\n:'''Canoeing''' is a most common and universal type of water tourism in the country. A short explanation of Lithuanian general name of a boat ''\u201cbaidar\u0117\u201d'', and how it differs from ''\u201ckanoja\u201d'', may have some practical value if you are going to rent the one. The name ''baidar\u0117'' comes from the ''Aleutian kayak'' and applies to both racing and recreational kayaks, and to both frame and inflatable kayaks. It is a name of a narrow two seater boat which has a cockpit. The other Lithuanian name ''\u201ckanoja\u201d'', it is ''canoe'',  applies exclusively to ''\"sit-on-top\" kayaks''. Therefore the names \u201ccanoe\u201d and \u201ccanoeing\u201d is used here as a general term in order to distinguish it from  the \u201cwhitewater kayak\u201d which is not common in Lithuania. \n:There are many different companies across the country that offer canoe rental, usually you can choose from several different types and models. Pay attention that English translation may be rather loose and the name ''\u201cbaidar\u0117\u201d'' may be translated differently on different websites. You should focus on the pictures and decide whether you need a \u201ctwo seater cockpit kayak\u201d (''baidar\u0117''), \"sit-on-top\" kayak (''kanoja''), or a proper \u201cone seater whitewater kayak\u201d (''kajakas'').\n\n[[Image:Ula river, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|Canoeing in \u016ala River, Dz\u016bkija National Park.]]\n\n:Since canoe rental is a seasonal business, some companies switch to the ski rental during the winter time and appear with a different name next spring. You may want to search for canoe rentals independently, so here below are the four main key words to search in Lithuanian language and their literal English equivalents which may differ from what you are used to:\n\n::: ''baidar\u0117s'' (canoes), \n::: ''baidari\u0173 nuoma'' (rent of canoes), \n::: ''baidar\u0117s nuomai'' (canoes for rent),\n::: ''vandens turizmas'' (water tourism).\n\n'''Places to go canoeing'''\n\nUsually every rental company offers the certain routes in certain rivers. You can choose the desirable region or a concrete river or lake and arrange your stay in some larger town there, the boats will be delivered to the agreed point and taken back after your journey. Alternatively, if you plan to stay in the certain city and have no concrete idea about the rivers, there always is some suitable water route not so far away from any city, just ask the company for suggestions.\nIf you want to plan the trip yourself and need something to start with, one of the practical ways is to select your river or lake route using [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Vandens-turizmas-%C5%BEem%C4%97lapi%C5%B3-serija-baidarininkams/134840009892174 series of the 9 water-proof/tear-proof maps] issued specifically for canoeists: you will know for sure that you have a map, you\u2019ll be sure that all of those nine places are the most popular places for such kind of activities, and you\u2019ll know where exactly you have to start and where you are supposed to finish. \n\n:The list of the names of the nine maps with short water route explanations (these are full routes which can be shortened according to your own preference):\n\n::'''1''' {{-}} '''Dubysa''' (scale 1:40,000) \u2013 a prominent Samogitian river that flows in the middle of the country.

The location of nature objects, such as mounds, forests, trees, stones and water embodied the network of sacred places in the pre-Christian Lithuania. The ancient Balts had their own center of pilgrimage Rickoyto ''(Romuva)'', its geographical locality is still unknown. It is, that the trinity of Baltic gods \u2013 ''Perk\u016bnas'' (Thunder God), ''Patrimpas'' (Fertility God) and ''Pikuolis'' (Underworld God) \u2013 were venerated under the old and high-powered oak at that place.\nThe 16th-17th centuries are the formative period of the network of Christian pilgrimage places in Lithuania. [[Trakai]], \u0160iluva, Gate Of Dawn ''(Au\u0161ros Vartai)'', Samogitian Calvary ''([[\u017demai\u010di\u0173 Kalvarija]])'', [[Vilnius]] Calvary were the main pilgrimage centers as well as Vilnius Cathedral (veneration of Saint Casimir). The new pilgrimage places refreshed the network in the 18th\u201319th centuries, the Hill of Crosses, an ancient [http://www.piliakalniai.lt/piliakalnis.php?piliakalnis_id=512 hill-fort of Jurgai\u010diai], became one of them when after uprising of 1831 and 1863 the crosses had been built in the memory of dead.\nThe places of apparitions of Virgin Mary complement the network of pilgrimage places in the 20th century exclusively. The obstruction for pilgrimage to the sacred places either places of apparitions was evident in the soviet era; several places (Vilnius Calvary, The Hill of Crosses, Janoniai Spring in Anyk\u0161\u010diai district ) were destroyed physically.\nThe 23 main catholic pilgrimage places can be grouped at the present time. Most of them are bound with the cult of Virgin Mary (12 \u2013 the worship places of images of Holy Mary, 3 \u2013 places of apparitions, 1 \u2013 the place of coronet image and apparition). The second groups \u2013 Calvaries (5 places, the Samogitian Calvary has the miraculous image too), the places of saints and cult of holy persons (4 places, the Cathedral of Vilnius has the coronet image of Holy Mary too), the worship places of Cross (2 places) and holy spring (Ma\u017eu\u010diai Spring 2&nbsp;km away from Alksn\u0117nai village, Vilkavi\u0161kis district).\n \nThe main and most popular places of pilgrimage today are included into the tourist routes.\n\nMotor vehicle transport is one of the forms of travel mode to the most pilgrimage places in Lithuania (individual cars, shuttle or charter buses). Pilgrimage is travelling on foot too, this is popular among youth. Directions of traveling on foot can be divided into 3 large areas: \n[[Image:Sarcophagus of Saint Casimir at Vilnius Cathedral.jpeg|thumb|Sarcophagus of Saint Casimir at Vilnius Cathedral.]]\n:'''1 \u2013 in Samogitia:''' Samogitian Calvary ''([[\u017demai\u010di\u0173 Kalvarija]])'', Ber\u017eoras;\n:'''2 \u2013 in Central Lithuania:''' \u0160iluva, the Hill of Crosses ''(Kry\u017ei\u0173 kalnas)'', Krekenava (28.60&nbsp;km south-west of Panev\u0117\u017eys), Pa\u017eaislis ([[Kaunas]] suburb);\n:'''3 \u2013 in Dz\u016bkija:''' Gate of Dawn ''(Au\u0161ros Vartai)'' in [[Vilnius]], [[Trakai]], Piva\u0161i\u016bnai (23&nbsp;km north-east of Alytus). \n*Pilgrimage by foot from the Hill of Croses to \u0160iluva is organized by [http://siauliai.lcn.lt/ \u0160iauliai Diocese] annually in the beginning of September.\n*Pilgrimage by foot from the Gate of Dawn to [[Trakai]] is organized by [http://www.vajc.lt/index.php/kontaktai Vilnius Archdiocese Youth Centre] annually in the beginning of September. \n*[http://www.piligrimai.lt/about-us/ Community of Lithuanian Pilgrims] provides assistance and organizes pilgrimage by bus:\n:*'''[http://www.vilniauskalvarijos.lt/ Vilnius Calvary] feast''' - every year on Whitsunday;\n:*'''[http://vepriai.lt/ Vepriai] feast''' - every year on Whitsunday;\n:*'''[[\u017demai\u010di\u0173 Kalvarija|Samogitian Calvary]] feast''' \u2013 every year in the beginning of July;\n:*'''[http://www.kryziukalnas.lt/ Hill of Crosses] feast''' \u2013 every year last Sunday of July;\n:*'''[http://www.pivasiunai.lt/ Piva\u0161i\u016bnai] feast''' \u2013 every year August&nbsp;15;\n:*'''[http://www.piligrimukelias.lt/index.php?id=263&lng=1 Krekenava] feast''' \u2013 every year August&nbsp;15;\n:*'''[http://www.siluva.lt/ \u0160iluva] feast''' \u2013 every year in the first half of September;\n:*'''[http://www.ausrosvartai.lt Gate of Dawn] feast''' \u2013 every November.\n\n===Sport===\nLithuanians are proudest of one thing: Basketball. To them it is not just a sport, but a symbol of freedom. Lithuanians had been oppressed by the Russians for a long time, kept fighting against them and were the first to declare their independence from the Soviet Union. Basketball finalized this process when the newly independent country of Lithuania participated in the World Olympics in Barcelona: they barely managed to raise enough money to send the team to the tournament, but they returned as heroes because they came back with a bronze medal after besting the Russian team for it. This victory was even more meaningful because, in previous Olympic games, Lithuanian athletes had been forced to play for the Soviet Union, winning a gold medal for the Soviets in the 1988 Olympics. Lithuania also has the highest number of NBA players per capita of any country, and is consistently one of the top-ranked countries according to The International Basketball Association (FIBA).\n\nLithuania is as basketball-mad as the British are with football or New Zealand with rugby.  Lithuania is one of the most successful teams in international competition, winning medals in three out of four Olympic tournaments, (bronze), and finishing fourth in 2008.  Major domestic clubs are [http://www.zalgiris.lt/ BC \u017dalgiris] from [[Kaunas]] and [http://bc.lrytas.lt/ BC Lietuvos Rytas] from [[Vilnius]].  Basketball is so popular in Lithuania that you are sure to find a basketball court in almost every park and playground.\n\nBe careful if some people challenge you to a basketball game. Common Lithuanians are very good in basketball, and you might just embarrass yourself.\n\nArvydas Sabonis is a legendary basketball player that earned a spot in Basketballs Hall of Fame.\n\nArt\u016bras Karni\u0161ovas is all time leading scorer for Lithuanian national team.\n\nSwimming is also a sport that is gaining a lot of attention, especially after R\u016bta Meilutyt\u0117 won olympic gold medal in women's breaststroke.\n\n\u017dydr\u016bnas Savickas is another person that Lithuanians are proud of. He is considered as the strongest man in the world.\n\nKnowing Lithuanian sports will definitely help you win their hearts.\n\n====Major sports  venues====\n*[http://www.siemens-arena.com/ '''Siemens Arena'''] <listing name=\"\" alt=\"\" directions=\"Vilnius, north of centre, Baltupiai district\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" address=\"Ozo St 14, LT-08200 Vilnius\" phone=\"+370 5 247-7576\" tollfree=\"\" email=\"info@siemensarena.lt\" fax=\"+370 5 247-7578\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\"></listing>\n*[http://www.pramoguarena.lt '''Pramog\u0173 Arena'''] <listing name=\"\" alt=\"(Former Ice Arena)\" directions=\"Vilnius, north-west of centre, Vir\u0161uli\u0161k\u0117s district\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" address=\"\u0104\u017euolyno St 9, LT-07171 Vilnius\" phone=\"+370 5 242-4444\" tollfree=\"\" email=\"info@pramoguarena.lt\" fax=\"+370 5 242-4400\" url=\"\" hours=\"Weekdays - 14:00-20:00, weekends 12:00-20:00\" price=\"\"></listing>\n[[Image:Zhalgiris Arena interior 18 Aug 2011.jpeg|thumb|Basketball in \u017dalgiris Arena]]\n*[http://www.zalgirioarena.lt '''\u017dalgiris Arena'''] <listing name=\"\" alt=\"\" directions=\"Kaunas, south of the Old Town, near Akropolis mall, on the island of Neman river\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" address=\"Karaliaus Mindaugo Ave 50, Kaunas\" phone=\"Ticket Office in Arena +370 37 354-403\" tollfree=\"\" email=\"kasa@zalgirioarena.lt\" fax=\"+370 37 406-967\" url=\"\" hours=\"\" price=\"\"></listing>\n*[http://www.svyturioarena.lt '''\u0160vyturys Arena'''] <listing name=\"\" alt=\"(\u0160vyturio arena)\" directions=\"Klaip\u0117da, west of 2nd ferry to Smiltyne terminal, east of a roundabout at Taikos pr./Baltijos pr.\" address=\"Dubysos St 10, Klaip\u0117da\" phone=\"ticket office +370 46 241-500, mob. +370 640 23858\" url=\"\" hours=\"Tuesday-Friday 12:00-19:00\" price=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" email=\"info@svyturioarena.lt\" fax=\"+370 46 241-517\"></listing>\n[[Image:Shiauliu Arena in Shiauliai, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|\"\u0160iauli\u0173 Arena\" in \u0160iauliai, in winter.]]\n\n*[http://www.siauliuarena.lt '''\u0160iauliai Arena'''] <listing name=\"\" alt=\"(\u0160iauli\u0173 arena)\" directions=\"\u0160iauliai, south-west of the centre, beyond the railway, head on down the main street (Til\u017e\u0117s gatv\u0117) up to the major crossing, turn to the right, the park can be seen in a distance.\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" address=\"J.

[http://www.akropolis.lt/ Akropolis] (a chain of shopping malls in Lithuania) is one of them and definitely worth visiting if you are a shopping malls maniac, as it houses an ice skating rink, bowling lanes and a cinema.\n\nShopping centre [http://www.helioscity.lt/ Helios City] in Savanori\u0173 Avenue offers to have dinner, to take a cup of coffee and to go shopping under the one roof. On the first and the second floors of the Helios City restaurants, cafes, small shops, beauty salon, dry cleaning and other service companies are located. The centre of the city or the Old Town and the new leisure and service centre are separated by less than 1.5km. It is convenient to access the Helios City from any place of the city \u2013 either by public or proper  transport.\n\n[http://www.gariunai.lt/ Gari\u016bnai] is the Baltic's largest open air market, located on the western edge of [[Vilnius]]. Thousands of merchants can be found there on a good weekend, from not only Lithuania, but also from as far away as Ukraine. Clothes, shoes, and even music can be bought there. Counterfeit goods still can be found, and it was a serious issue several years ago. But since it's illegal the demand has decreased significantly, and as a consequence profits decreased as well, therefore merchants are not really interested in such trade even without an effort of authorities. Overall, a low price is guaranteed, quality is not.\n\n[[Kaunas]] is also a city of shopping centres, and the centre of the city, ''Laisv\u0117s'' avenue is a pedestrian thoroughfare. The main shopping centres in [[Kaunas]] are: Akropolis, [http://www.mega.lt/ Mega], [http://www.molas.lt/ Molas], [http://www.savascentras.lt/ Savas], HyperMaxima, and [http://www.urmas.net/ Urmas shopping area]. There is even that symbol of \"mall culture\", which is new to Lithuania, ''Akropolis''. Actually, Mega has the biggest aquarium in whole Europe that could be find in a mall. It has more than 800 fishes from every ocean and various seas. It is more than worth seeing.\n\n[[Klaipeda]] is a major shopping centre for people from [[Latvia]] and Kaliningrad. The main shopping centres are: Akropolis, Arena, [http://www.studlendas-klaipeda.lt/ Studlendas] and [http://www.big-klaipeda.lt/ BIG]. Many people coming to the city on cruise ships shop in [[Klaipeda]], due to the good value and price combination.\n\nAmber shops are very popular in Lithuania, which is found in the [[Baltic Sea]]. \n\nThe cost of living in Lithuania is cheaper than Western European Countries, some of the other Baltic Countries have similar prices, with some being even cheaper.\n\n==Eat==\nLithuanian dinners usually include meat, potato, vegetables and sometimes a curd sauce of some sort. Case in point: the ''cepelinai'', or zeppelins, which are meat filled potato-starch based zeppelin-shaped masses traditionally slathered in a sauce of sour cream, butter, and pork cracklings. Pork is traditionally eaten, beef much less so. Needless to say, vegans will have a hard time eating out, although some large restaurant chains will have vegetarian dishes on the menu.\n\nSome fast food in Lithuania, such as Kibinai, (from the Karaim people) small turnovers usually filled with spiced lamb, and Cheburekai (a Russian snack), large folds of dough with a scant filling of meat, cheese, or even apples, can be found around the city. \n\nMany restaurants have menus in English (usually in the Lithuanian menu) and to a lesser extent, Russian. Though use caution as sometimes menus in other languages may have inflated prices, although this is a rarity, and won't be found in [[Vilnius]], or the better known chains such as \u010cili Pica (Chili Pizza).\n\nIf you are traveling to Lithuanian shore from the eastern part of Lithuania and you are passing through Karmelava you must try Cepelinai. The Restaurant is called Bried\u017ei\u0173 Med\u017eiokl\u0117 (address Vilniaus street 54, Karm\u0117lava) and they have the biggest size Cepelinai in the whole country. Usually, 3 or 4 homemade Cepelinai call fill up a big person. To eat 2 Cepelinai at Bried\u017ei\u0173 Med\u017eiokl\u0117 is a huge achievement. Usually Lithuanians make the stop at Karm\u0117lava because in their eyes a trip to shore is extremely long and across the country, even though it lasts only a little bit over 2 hours.\n\n==Drink==\nLithuania is a beer drinking country, with the most famous brands being \u0160vyturys, Kalnapilis, Utenos, Horn and Gubernija. A visit to a kiosk will show that there may be more than 50 different brands of beer in this small country.  Alcohol percentages are displayed on the label, and usually range from 4 to 9.5 percent.  Compared to other European countries, beer is usually affordable, in shops starting from 1 \u20ac per half litre, in bars approx. 2,5 to 4 \u20ac per half litre (beer is sold by the half or full litre, a full litre being found rarely). The beer tastes excellent, putting global brands to shame and it can be said that Lithuanian lager is of at least equal quality to Czech, Slovak, German, and Polish lager. A request for a Lithuanian beer always generates goodwill, even in a Chinese or other foreign-themed restaurant.\n\nWhen you visit a bar or restaurant without intending to eat, try one of the bar snacks, which are very popular among Lithuanians. The most popular of these snacks consists of a bowl of pieces of garlic bread covered in cheese.\n\nIn addition to beer, rather cheap but high quality vodka (or \"degtin\u0117\" in Lithuanian) is consumed, but not to the extent usually associated with this part of the world. Also, every region has its own home-made speciality of which \"Samane\" is most famous/notorious and is best avoided. The larger supermarkets have an incredible variety of vodka from all the main vodka-producing countries.\n\nLithuanian mead, or ''midus'' is a beverage produced exclusively under government control.  It is commonly made from all sorts of Lithuanian flora, from leaves and berries to some tree bark. Alcohol percentages range from 10% to 75% (considered medicinal).\n\nFor tourists, quality sparkling wines, such as ''Alita'' or ''Mindaugas'', and local liqueurs are popular choices to bring back home.\n\nKeep in mind the law that came into effect from Jan 2009 that prohibits selling alcohol in shops between 10PM and 8AM (bars, cafes, restaurants etc. are exempt from this).\n\nIn shops and caf\u00e9s different tea and coffee qualities are widely available. The selection in coffee ranges from northern European brands to French ones. In coffee houses, you should expect to pay up to 1.50 \u20ac for your coffee. Some caf\u00e9s offer also a variety of special coffees with more or less special prices. Many cafes (kavin\u0117s) still make \"lazy\" coffee, which is simply coffee grounds and boiling water, unfiltered, with grounds at the bottom of the cup, often surprising the drinker - ask before you buy! Tea is usually sold at 50% of the price of coffee. Some of the wonderful drinks such as the Marganito are great for fun filled party drinks and rated one of the top kinds of wine in the country, perfect for weddings.\n\nUnlike restaurants, or pubs aimed at tourists, bars ''(Baras)'' may be frequented by heavy drinkers and can therefore be somewhat rowdy. Nevertheless a visit may still be very rewarding, especially if you accept an invitation to participate in karaoke.\n\nA law banning smoking in caf\u00e9s, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, discotheques and other public establishments was passed in May 2006, and came into effect on 1 Jan 2007. However, many nightclubs have internal smoking rooms, which have a degree of ventilation.\n\nTap water is suitable for drinking in many parts of Lithuania. In other areas, local people prefer to purchase bottled water or to run tap water through water filters. If you need to buy bottled water, a 5 litre bottle is not much more expensive than a one litre bottle. Where in doubt about the tap water, seek local advice. \n\nMineral water is also offered in restaurants, caf\u00e9s and shops, although it's a bit more expensive than tap water. Some popular brands are ''Rasa'', ''Tich\u0117'' and ''Vytautas''.\n\n==Sleep==\nThere are two main clearly distinguished types of accommodation in Lithuania: \u201curban style\u201d accommodation and \u201ccountryside style\u201d accommodation. Roughly the former type is called ''Vie\u0161butis'' (Hotel), and the latter is called ''Sodyba'' (Homestead). Which one belongs to the actual hotel or hostel, or B&B, or some other standard international category depends on how the owners' marketing policy is aimed at foreign visitors. Domestically it is considered that the actual difference is only in those two types of accommodation and price. For example, the range of \u201curban\u201d type of accommodation may be called by locals a luxury hotel, budget hotel, a cosy hotel, and a motel \u2013 those all versus the \u201chomestead\u201d, which can range from a cosy little farmhouse style hotel to mini-resort. This may be very useful to know if you want to move around without pre-booking accommodation or just in unusual circumstances: you\u2019ll be able to understand locals if they say that \u201cthere are no hotels, only one farmstead (homestead) nearby\u201d, and you won\u2019t try to insist that \u201cthere must be a B&B, I know that for sure\u201d.\n\n===Hotels, motels, hostels, apartments=== \nThere are several international hotel chains in the major Lithuanian cities, and a variety of local hotels. Many hotels and motels are members of [http://www.lvra.lt/ ''Lithuanian Hotel and Restaurant Association''], some hostels are members of [http://www.lha.lt/ ''Lithuanian Hostels Association''].  Hotels, hostels and motels are ranked by stars (1 to 5 stars). The price of accommodation depends very much on the place. For instance, in [http://www.joniskis.lt/ Joni\u0161kis] (Northern Lithuania), you can get a good hotel room for about \u20ac30 whereas an equivalent room might be as much as \u20ac60-90 in [[Vilnius]]. \n\nSome hotels in [[Neringa]] and [[Palanga]] may be similarly or more expensive as in Vilnius because of highly acclaimed location. In this case the price may seem high and hotel itself overrated, but it all is determined by location. It especially applies to Neringa which is a more expensive place in all respects.\n\nMost hotels do have web home pages, but some do not. Nevertheless, the Internet helps considerably in planning. \n\nYou will find the hotels of every town in their own articles. However, remember that this is a service maintained by the volunteers and you should not wait for current prices let alone that there would be all the possibilities listed.\n\nMost large cities such as Vilnius or [[Kaunas]] have an abundance of hotel options from \u20ac15 and up. When travelling to a popular vacation spot in the summer and around the New Year (like Palanga or [[Druskininkai]]) make sure to book a room in advance because demand may outnumber supply. Additionally, some of the cafes on the main highways between cities also have rooms to rent.\n\nHostels, usually called ''Sve\u010di\u0173 namai'' (Guest Houses), provide simple, budget accommodation. They may be good places to meet other travellers and wrong places if you expect to deal with locals. \n\nIf you want to rent the apartment, the prices will be usually from \u20ac200 a month. In the biggest towns there are companies which rent apartments \"to the long-time tourist or worker\". In these you complete on good conditions the apartment furnished and cleaned by the cleaner from \u20ac300. \n\nIf you are looking for an apartment for a shorter period (from a few days onwards), do a Web search for ''\"trumpalaik\u0117 but\u0173 nuoma\"''. This will give you some portals or sites of companies, though not all of them are available in English \u2013 some are, however, available in other languages such as German, Polish or Russian. Also you can use option of online translation, it often is sufficient.\n\n===Countryside tourism homesteads===\n[[File:Miego Klinika, Lithuania.jpeg|thumb|Cottages of [http://www.miegoklinika.lt/ ''\"Miego Klinika\"'' (\"Sleep Clinic\")] homestead in ''Kurtuv\u0117nai Regional Park'', Kelm\u0117 district]]\nHomestead (''Sodyba'', nom., sing. or ''sodybos'', nom., plur.) is a common name of the separate tourism industry branch. One of the key features is that homesteads typically are not related to agriculture, but usually are associated with short-term and long-term recreation places. They are a type of accommodation in the countryside. Homesteads which are members of [http://www.atostogoskaime.lt/en/apie-lkta/about-association ''Lithuanian Countryside Tourism Association''] are ranked by storks (1 to 5 storks). The official website of the Association [http://www.countryside.lt/ Countryside.lt] offers the shining catalogue for accommodation alternatives and you find nearly all the countryside targets and a reservation system from there. \n\nThere are 10 official types of activity; each homestead is focused on one or several of them. Here is a list of all ten types of activity you can choose from their website: Quiet recreation, Culture recreation, Active recreation, Holidays for Families, Culinary Heritage, Environment-friendly Homestead, Wellness Homestead, Family Celebrations, Business events, Agrotourism. \n\nCurrently the association has over 400 homesteads, most of which provide Quiet recreation services (around 200 homesteads). The Family Celebrations are in second place, and the third is the Holidays for Families with children. Culinary heritage homesteads are scattered throughout the regions and offer services related to the traditions of the concrete region.\n\nThe popularity of Celebrations service can answer the question where the Lithuanian urban youth go to celebrate: the further from city the better. You have a whole house with all equipment and a territory with ponds and saunas on your own... and everything is surrounded with a large forest. This is a striking difference compared to the Westerners who come to the Baltic cities to get drunk. It may give you an idea why locals sometimes express a very negative attitude to the foreign visitors and insist that they are inappropriately behaving in the inappropriate place. You should know and accept that the forest is an appropriate place in such situations. Homestead that is focusing on Celebrations provides a far more adequate service than some luxury hotel or a restaurant in a city can offer. \n\nThe styles of homestead range from very simple \u201csleeping with the grandmother\" to large mini-resorts. Three homesteads listed below are not only deserving attention, but also distinctly represent three different styles. They all are conveniently situated near the main roads, but at the same time conveniently secluded. The first one is almost in the middle of the country, Samogitia region; the second one is in the centre of the country not far from Kaunas and Via Baltica, Auk\u0161taitija region; and the third one is closer to the capital and situated on the edge of Auk\u0161taitija and Dz\u016bkija regions.\n\n*[http://www.karpyne.lt/ '''Karpyn\u0117'''] <sleep name=\"\" alt=\"(Carp Estate)\" address=\"Gab\u0161iai village, Raseiniai district\" directions=\"0.5km north of the A1 motorway Vilnius-Kaunas: 173km from Vilnius or 137km from Klaip\u0117da\" phone=\"+370 428 70123, mobile +370 650 77437\" lat=\"N55\u00b020'22''\" long=\"E23\u00b005'52''\" tollfree=\"\" email=\"info@karpyne.lt\" fax=\"+370 428 70124\" url=\"\" checkin=\"14:00\" checkout=\"12:00\" price=\"Guesthouse eastern side: double room \u20ac40/1 person, \u20ac47/2 persons w breakfast; guesthouse western side \u20ac52/1 person, \u20ac58/2 persons; additional person in the room \u20ac20 (w breakfast) ; tripple with a sitting room (for a family of 4 persons) \u20ac90; Lux \u20ac73/1 person, \u20ac87/2 persons.

Camp sites are ranked by stars (1 to 4 stars). Most of camp sites are in recreation areas and very few are near the main roads. There are about 25 camp sites that are members of the association, and several that are not. Lithuanians consider this kind of business not profitable. If there is a need for a camp site it is very common to look for the homestead instead: many homesteads allow to stay with the camper vans or just to set the tent in their territory, some have the parking sites specifically for campers, separately from the car parking lots. All facilities are available, living comforts vary in accordance with the rank (storks) of the homestead. Therefore it is impossible to come across the camp site incidentally just driving down the main road (e.g. Via Baltica) if you don\u2019t know its location beforehand or don\u2019t  look specifically.

''campsite'', in contrast to the camp sites suitable for camper vans: ''kempingas'', en. transl. ''camping''), are just a small plots of meadow in the depth of the forests and by the rivers. Some of those icons indicate the presence of homesteads that specialize in countryside tourism industry and offer a certain zone where the canoeists and bicyclists can stay in their tents overnight for the small fee. Typically such sites are surrounded with impassable thickets; scarce wild meadows are either swampy or full of formicaries and unsuitable for rest, the private land is the only salvation. The sites that are in public recreation zones usually are free of charge and have no facilities except some rugged wooden furniture (benches and tables) typical for Lithuania.\n\n==Learn==\nLithuania has one of the best educational systems in the World. Many universities participate in student exchange programs. Most popular international college in Lithuania is [http://www.lcc.lt/ Lithuania Christian College], LCC, in [[Klaip\u0117da]]. The best universities of Lithuania are [http://www.vu.lt/lt/ Vilnius University ''(Vilniaus Universitetas)''], VU, [http://www.vgtu.lt/ Vilnius Gediminas Technical University ''(Vilniaus Gedimino Technikos Universitetas)''], VGTU, and [http://ktu.lt/ Kaunas University of Technology ''(Kauno Technologijos Universitetas)''], KTU.\n\nIn [[Kaunas]], apart the biggest technical university in the country, KTU, there are a [http://www.lsmuni.lt/ Lithuanian University Of Health Science] ''(Lietuvos sveikatos moksl\u0173 universitetas)'', [http://www.lkka.lt/ Sports University] ''(Sporto universitetas)'', the [http://lmta.lt/  Academy of Music and Theatre] ''(Muzikos ir teatro akademija)'', [http://www.asu.lt Aleksandras Stulginskis University] (former Agriculture University), and multidisciplinary [http://www.vdu.lt/ University of Vytautas Magnus]. \n\n[[Klaip\u0117da]] and [[\u0160iauliai]] also has its own universities. In the country several lower educational institutions which go with the name ''kolegija'' (engl a college) also are found. \n\nThe course supply hangs very much from the university and there also are somewhere programmes for English. However, pay attention to the fact that Lithuania's official language is Lithuanian and in the law it has been prescribed that the Lithuanian student has a right to study in Lithuanian in Lithuania. Especially all the courses of the candidate level will be thus in Lithuanian and in the Master of Arts programmes in English the bulk of the courses is in English. Depending on the rules of the university the courses must have a certain number of foreign students before it must be in English (it touches courses in English) and if this limit is not exceeded, the lecturer may lecture, if desired, in Lithuanian. Because the employment of universities has been lowered last year about 20% and the addition which is paid for the courses in English in some universities to the lecturers was removed, many lecturers choose the easiest road preferably for them to themselves. Then the foreign students can take the course by writing either essays or based on personal meetings. \n\nThe grading system in Lithuania is generally 1-10 in which 5-10 correspond to the accepted performances. The local students usually have to keep their average very high and still a higher one in order to get the scholarship in order to guarantee free studies. There is no financial aid for studies.\n\n==Work==\nThere are now many work options in Lithuania. Any EU national can work and live freely in Lithuania. For non-EU citizens residence permits must be obtained, and employers must prove a lack of competent workers in Lithuania for such employment, which can be difficult. \n\nIn Lithuania you need the residence permit and a registered address for the working for non-EU citizens. The immigration authorities will usually be fairly fluent in English, otherwise either Russian or Lithuanian is useful. One seldom manages working life without control of the language. \n \nIn Lithuania the worker pays 21% of an income tax 6% for health and unemployment insurance which is about 3%. The taxes take about 20% of the salary, irrespective of income. Minimum wage is about 300&nbsp;Euros and average wage is approaching 850&nbsp;Euros.\n\n==Stay safe==\nIn general you should take basic safety measures:\n\n* Take care when visiting potentially dangerous neighbourhoods at night. After dark it is safer to walk along main roads, than to take a short cut through a park or apartment complex, as these areas often have very poor lighting. Take a taxi if you are nervous. A thing to watch out for is bicycle theft, and it is advisable not to leave valuable things in your car. \n\n* As with eastern Europe in general, openly gay behaviour such as holding hands or kissing may result in a violent confrontation from an onlooker. Suspicion of homosexuality may also cause problems; two male visitors to a straight nightclub should sit a respectable distance apart, even if they are heterosexual. Overall, if you are a man that prefers other men over females you should not be open about it. Usually, the ones that are proud about it get harassed. On the other hand, lesbians are not typically attacked.\n\n* Members of ethnic minorities, (particularly those of African descent), may experience some form of racism. This is not tolerated by the authorities and racist attacks are rare. However non-whites may at least have to get used to being stared at by locals, especially in rural areas. More often than not this can be out of pure curiosity rather than malice. The issue of race relations, the history of slavery and civil rights are relatively unknown. That said, the presence of several Afro-American basketball players in the Lithuanian league does help and means that racism is perhaps not as big a problem as in other eastern European countries. The best way to overcome any minor issues is to maintain a dignified air and understanding that for many Lithuanians living in a homogeneous society, they may not have had any previous contact with a person of color. Therefore, if you are a dark skinned, do not be surprised that they whisper to each other. You might hear them saying something similar to \"nigger\". They do not say it because they mean to disrespect you. They do not understand why it is a wrong thing to do, since they hear this word in movies and music in a language which is foreign to them.\n\n* Driving in Lithuania is considered dangerous according to European standards. Lithuania's rapidly expanding economy has lead to an increase in traffic density, thus accident rates are high. As a pedestrian, take great care when crossing the roads, as pedestrian crossings may be ignored by cheeky drivers. When driving be careful of aggressive, quickly going and irresponsible drivers. It's better to pass them even if they are flouting rules. Keep in mind that traffic police could be corrupt. Mind the forest roads, collisions with wildlife animals can easily occur. \n\n===Natural danger===\n* If bitten by a dog or a wild animal, seek medical attention immediately; ''emergency phone number:'' '''112'''.\n*In some parts of the country, particularly in pastures, forest outskirts and meadows with a high grass, there is a low risk of contracting tick-borne encephalitis. Vaccination is advised at least 2 weeks before you plan out-door activities in a wild nature. Risky areas (mostly agricultural areas of pastures with some woodland) are annually updated on the [http://www.erke.lt/s/show/6/Erkinio-encefalito-paplitimo-\u017eem\u0117lapiai map of the prevalence of encephalitis-infected ticks]. The risk of Lyme disease is similarly low, vaccination is not available. Prevention: avoid high grass areas and wear long trousers and appropriate shoes.\n* The main wild animals that transmit rabies are raccoon dog and red fox. All occurrences of this horrible disease are FATAL, but a prior course of vaccination and proper emergency prophylactic treatment may buy you 12 hours before proper its onset. Plan your activities in the forest accordingly. Oral vaccination of wildlife is regularly carried out since 2006 up to date. According to [http://vmvt.lt/ State Food and Veterinary Service] the number of infected animals has significantly decreased; all infected animals occur in the eastern districts of the country, supposedly from Belarus. State Food and Veterinary Service regularly informs that if rabies vaccine bait is found, leave it alone and do not touch it.\n* There is a one species of poisonous snake, the European adder, which has a distinct dark zig-zag on its pale back. Poisonous insects are bees, wasps and bumblebees. The only poisonous plant is Sosnowsky's Hogweed, an invasive plant which appeared in Lithuania in c.&nbsp;1950. Since 1990 it has quickly spread all over the country and in 2001 it was included in the list of malicious animals and plants. The plant is 3\u20135&nbsp;m in height, the leaves are 50\u201360&nbsp;cm long and its all parts are extremely toxic; skin contact causes severe chemical burns (up to 3rd degree) and skin necrosis.\n\n==Stay healthy==\n[[Image:Pharmacy in Vilnius Old Town.jpeg|thumb|Official logo of Lithuanian pharmacies resembles the Rod of Asclepius shaped like the letter \"V\", green graphics on a white background.

Christian and pagan traditions are very intertwined in Lithuanian culture]]\n[[Image:All Saint's night in Lithuania.jpeg|thumb| All Saint's Day, one of the most significant annual events: time to remember loved ones. Don't be annoyed if bars seem rather deserted this day, remember that you are the guest in this country.]]\n\nLithuanians are a Baltic nation; however, it's common for tourists to think that they are somehow connected with Russians. \n\nLithuanians form their own distinct ethnic group and speak their own language (Lithuanian), which is one of the most archaic Indo-European languages, belonging to the Baltic ('''not''' the Slavic) branch of Indo-European languages.\n\nIt is a notoriously difficult language to master, but learning how to greet locals in their own language can go a long way. They will appreciate your efforts in Lithuanian.\n\nLithuania was part of the Soviet Union from the end of World War II until 1991. You should also try to remember that the Lithuanian capital is [[Vilnius]], not Riga, which is the capital of neighbouring [[Latvia]], a common mistake for travelers and an annoyance to locals.\n\nBecause of war time occupations by Tsarist Russia in the 19th century, the Soviet Union in the 20th century and the territorial disputes with Poland in the early 20th century, conversations revolving around disputes with neighboring countries are not a good idea for those not from the region. Be careful when mentioning Lithuania in the context of the former USSR. Any praising of Soviet practices is very unlikely to be understood or appreciated by the Lithuanians. Talking about World War II or the Holocaust is not something to talk about either. This is because this is a very touchy subject to many Lithuanians.\n\nLithuanians may appear at times nationalistic; however, it is with good reason that they are a proud nation as they have fought to maintain their cultural identity through dark times, and this has kept them a unique and in general a warm and charming race. Although most Lithuanians officially are Catholics, native (pagan) Lithuanian religion is still alive in traditions, ethnoculture, festivals, music etc. \n\nLithuanians may appear sad, depressive (suicide rates in Lithuania are among the highest in the world), a little bit rude and suspicious, so talking about your good health, wealth, and happiness could be sometimes taken negatively. Smile at a Lithuanian in the street and most likely they will not respond in kindness. Smiling in Lithuania is traditionally reserved for friends; smile at a stranger and they will either think you're making fun of them and there's something wrong with their clothes or hairdo, or that you must be an idiot. Furthermore, an automatic Western smile is widely regarded as insincere.\n\nWomen are traditionally treated with utmost respect. Female travellers should not act surprised or indignant when their Lithuanian male friends pay their bills at restaurants, open every door in front of them, offer their hand to help them climb down that little step or help them carry anything heavier than a handbag - this is not sexual harassment or being condescending to the weaker sex. Male travellers should understand that this is exactly the sort of behavior that most Lithuanian girls and women will expect from them, too.\n\nIt is considered somewhat impolite for men to eat or drink with their hat or cap on while sitting at the table. This does not apply if the head must be covered for religious reasons (Judaism, Sikhs, etc.) or eating while walking on the street.\n\n==Contact==\nIn Lithuania, internal area codes consist of a zero mostly followed by 2 digits for the town, followed by 6 digits for the local subscriber number. Smaller towns have a zero and then 3 digits and the 5 digit local subscriber number. Vilnius has 7 digit numbers and just ''5'' as the city code. The national number's total length is always 8 digits if one excludes the initial zero (as one must, of course, when dialling from abroad).\n\nTo call abroad from Lithuania, the international access code is 00\n \nInternational and roaming calls are expensive. To reduce your bill you can:\n:* buy \"phone cards\" for international calls;\n:* talk over the Internet.\n  \n===Land line phones===\nThere is monopoly operator for land line phones - [https://www.telia.lt/privatiems/ Telia], a subsidiary of Sweden (Telia) and Finland (Sonera). Land line phones are easy to find in all country. Public phone booths are used with cards, which you can find in kiosks, \"Telia\" or newspaper stands, however this service is left mostly in hospitals, dorms and some other institutions, as well as at the relevant points in the largest cities, for example in Vilnius bus and train stations. So far existing rules does not allow to refuse this service, but Telia, which is responsible for maintenance, will do that in the nearest future at the first opportunity. There is no data of how much and whether at all it is useful for people who come from abroad.  \n     \n===Mobile phones===\nNumbers begin 06nnn, where the three digits \"n\" indicate the original network provider.\nThere are three mobile phone operators in Lithuania: [https://www.telia.lt/privatiems Telia], [http://www.bite.lt/ BIT\u0116 Lietuva] and [http://www.tele2.lt/ TELE 2]. About 97% of the country's surface is covered by the standard European GSM 900/1800 MHz network, the remaining 3% are non-walkable forests.\n\n===Internet===  \nIf you're bringing a laptop, Wireless LAN Hot-Spots are available in distinct places (mostly [https://wifi.telia.lt/ \"Telia Wi-Fi\"]), sometimes free, otherwise not very cheap. Best chances of finding one are at airports, railway stations, in caf\u00e9s, shopping malls, universities, various places. You can ask in your hotel, but be prepared to pay. For those who need to connect at an Internet cafes, major cities do have internet cafes. You can get free wireless Internet in [[Kaunas]] main pedestrian street -  Laisv\u0117s Al\u0117ja. Average internet speed in Lithuania is actually better than American internet speed. Average fixed broadband download speed reaches 70.2 Mb/s, while upload speed is 62.2 Mb/s. Keep in mind that the internet service that provide such speeds are not free.  \n\nWith your mobile phone you can use: CSD, HSCSD, GPRS or EDGE, but the cost may be unattractive. UMTS is only available in some bigger cities. If your phone is not SIM-locked, you may consider purchasing a pre-paid SIM card designed for data access. \n\nIf you want to communicate with your friends or locals using internet, you'll need two programs Skype or ICQ. The most popular chatting program is Skype, all of which can be used in English as well. As well in Lithuania social websites are quite popular. Facebook is the most popular; such websites like LiveJournal, Draugas.lt are rather unevenly popular, Myspace exists, but is not widely used, Twitter somehow does not fit.\n\n[[File:Lithuanian postbox.jpeg|thumb|upright|Official Lithuanian Postal Service logo: black graphics on a yellow background.]]\n\n===Postal Service===\n\n\n[http://www.post.lt '''''Lietuvos pa\u0161tas'''''] <listing name=\"\" alt=\"(Lithuanian Postal Service)\" directions=\"\" lat=\"\" long=\"\" address=\"\" phone=\"+370 700 55400\" tollfree=\"\" email=\"info@post.lt\" fax=\"+370 5 216-3204\" url=\"\" hours=\"(working hours M-F 09:00-19:00, Sa 09:00-14:00, may slightly vary from town to town)\" price=\"\">provides:</listing>\n:* worldwide postal services - priority and non-priority letter-post items (the former are marked with the label ''\u201cPrioritaire / Pirmenybin\u0117\u201d''), ordinary or insured parcels, prepaid packages of three standard sizes; courier mail service providing delivery both domestically and internationally; possibility to use the self-service parcel terminals [http://www.lpexpress.lt/ LP EXPRESS 24] (operational 24 hours a day, 7 days a week);\n[http://www.siuntupaieska.lt/ Siunt\u0173 paie\u0161ka]\n:*  financial services - money orders at any post office or [http://www.post.lt/en/private/financial-services/paypost/outlets \u201cPayPost\u201d] outlet, Western Union money transfers; you can pay utility, telecommunication bills, insurance and other contributions, or receive consumer credits (money is transferred at once after concluding the agreement); offers financial services of several alternative companies; non-citizens of the European Union member countries can claim a value added tax (VAT) refund on purchases obtained in Lithuania (refunds in cash only);\n:* subsciption to periodicals - orders of different Lithuanian and foreign press periodicals with the  delivery to your home or office, also doable [http://prenumerata.post.lt/ online];\n:* philately - sell different philatelic products: postage stamps, first day sheets, thematic folders of stamps, books; each year puts about 25 postage stamps into circulation;\n:* the largest post offices also sell international bus tickets.\n\nIn 2006, the enterprise was reorganized to the Public Limited Company ''Lietuvos pa\u0161tas''.

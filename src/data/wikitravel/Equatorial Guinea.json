A former Spanish colony, it borders [[Cameroon]] and [[Gabon]]. This country is one of the largest oil producing countries in Sub-Sahara, behind [[Angola]] and [[Nigeria]]. Since the discovery, the country has flown into economic stardom, but this country remains one of the most corrupt countries in the world, and it is very common to see officials asking for bribes around the corners of the country. \n\n==Understand==\n\n\nThe locals are very hospitable and have a certain affection for almost everything related to Spain. Until 1968, the country was a Spanish colony, making it the only country in Africa that was colonised by Spain. \n\n===History===\nIn the Rio Muni region there is believed to have been a widespread pygmy population, of whom only isolated pockets remain in the north. Bantu migrations between the 17th and 19th centuries brought the coastal tribes and later the Fang. \n\nThe Portuguese explorer Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3, seeking a path to [[India]], is credited as being the first European to discover the island of [[Bioko]] in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' (\"Beautiful\"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. The islands of Fernando P\u00f3 and Annob\u00f3n were colonized by Portugal in 1474.\n\nIn 1778, the island, adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the mainland between the Niger River and Ogoue Rivers were ceded to the Spanish Empire in exchange for territory in the American continent.  From 1827 to 1843, the [[United Kingdom]] established a base on the island to combat the slave trade which was then moved to [[Sierra Leone]] upon agreement with Spain in 1843. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, it became known as the ''Territorios Espa\u00f1oles del Golfo de Guinea Ecuatorial''. The mainland portion, Rio Muni, became a protectorate in 1885 and a colony in 1900. Between 1926 and 1959 all three regions were united as the colony of Spanish Guinea.\n\nEquatorial Guinea gained independence from Franco's Spain in October 1968. Since then, it has been ruled by two men. Francisco Mac\u00edas Nguema, the first president, was a brutal dictator who despised intellectuals, killed a large number of the ethnic Bubi minority, banned fishing, and awarded himself a huge number of grandiose titles (including President for Life). After a purge on his own family, he was overthrown by his nephew Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo in 1979 and later captured and executed by shooting. Obiang's rule has seen less violence, but his regime is still brutally repressive. Political power is centralized in his small mainland clan, and most senior members of the government are related. \n\nThe discovery of large offshore oil reserves in 1996 has brought a considerable amount of money into the country, giving it one of the highest GDPs in Africa, yet much of the money goes into the hands of the ruling elite, with the majority of the people remaining very poor.\n\n===Climate===\nEquatorial Guinea has two distinctive and very pronounced seasons: rainy and dry seasons. April to October are the wettest months of the year, and December to March are the driest.\n\n===People===\nThe major ethnic groups are the Fang of the mainland and the Bubi of Bioko Island.\n\n===Holidays===\nEquatorial Guinea recognizes the major Christian holidays. October 12 is Independence Day.\n\n==Regions==\n[[Image:Equatorial Guinea Regions map.png|thumb|upright=2|Map of Equatorial Guinea with regions colour-coded]]\n\n{{Regionlist\n\n| region1name=[[R\u00edo Muni]]  \n| region1color=#71b37b\n| region1items=[[Bata]]\n| region1description=all of the mainland\n\n| region2name=[[Bioko]]\n| region2color=#b5d29f\n| region2items=[[Malabo]]\n| region2description=island in the Gulf of Guinea, includes the capital city\n\n| region3name=[[Annob\u00f3n|Annobon]] \n| region3color=#4f93c0\n| region3items=\n| region3description=small island in the south of [[Sao Tome Island]] out in the Atlantic \n}}\n\n==Cities==\n* [[Malabo]] - the capital, on Bioko\n* [[Acalayong]]\n* [[Bata]] - the major city on the mainland\n* [[Ebebiyin]] - a major access point in the far northeast corner\n* [[Evinayong]]\n* [[Luba]] - another town on Bioko\n* [[Mbini]]\n* [[Mongomo]]\n\n[[image:Limbe_view_with_Bioko.jpg|thumb|]]\n==Get in==\n{{VisaRestriction|Entry will be refused to citizens of the [[Guinea]], [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Sierra Leone]], and those who recently visited those countries due to the current ebola virus outbreak.}}\n\n===Visas===\n\nCitizens of [[Barbados]], [[China]] (PRC), [[Tunisia]] and the [[United States]] may enter Equatorial Guinea visa-free. However they do need the following to present when entering EG: 2 visa applications, 2 passport photos, bank statement noting a minimum of $2,000 in your account, & proof of smallpox, yellow fever, & cholera vaccinations. (Note: this information, while perhaps officially correct, is not accurate. In practice, if not by law, all you will need to present on arrival at the airport in Malabo is a yellow fever card and your passport. Processing occurs quickly, and without much fuss or even interest.)\n\nCitizens of [[Cameroon]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Chad]], the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Gabon]] may enter Equatorial Guinea visa-free, provided that they have a national identity card or biometric passport.\n\nAll other nationalities need to submit to an EG embassy all of the above (plus passport and letter of invitation which is only granted from a Equatorial Guinea resident and almost impossible to get) in order to receive a visa. In Washington, the fee for the visa is USD100.\n\n===By plane===\nThere are two paved airports, one a few miles from Malabo (SSG), and one in Bata (BSG). The country's main airline is Ecuato Guineana de Aviaci\u00f3n, which operates national and international flights out of Malabo International Airport. \nOther airlines flying to Malabo airport include Lufthansa (from Frankfurt via Lagos), Iberia (from Madrid), JetAir (from Gatwick airport in London), Air France (from Paris), Ethiopian Airlines as well as Turkish Airlines.\n\n===By car===\nThe capital is on an island. However, the mainland may be accessed from Gabon via paved(tarmac) roads and from Cameroon via dirt tracks (inaccessible in rainy season). Roads in EG, however, are in a very dilapidated state(even for W. Africa) and 4x4 is necessary many months of the year.\n\nNote that the entry from Campo can be often closed. Also, the entry from Kye-Ossi and Ebebiyin may deny entry for visa-free Americans if sufficient reason for entry is not presented or if one is not ethnically Caucasian.\n\n===By bus===\n\n===By boat===\n\n==Get around==\n\n==Talk==\n\nThe official languages are '''[[Spanish phrasebook|Spanish]]''', '''[[French phrasebook|French]]''' and '''[[Portuguese phrasebook|Portuguese]]'''.\n\nSpanish is the language of education and administration, and is spoken fluently by roughly 68% of of the population, it is national language. \n\nOn the island of Annob\u00f3n, Fa d\u2019Amb\u00f4 (a Portuguese creole), replaces Spanish as the main language. The language is widely spoken in Malabo and among some people on Equatorial Guinea's mainland. Many residents of Bioko can also speak the local trade language Pichinglis, an English-based creole.\n\nDespite the fact that French and standard Portuguese are official languages, they are not widely used. If you can only afford one phrasebook, bring a Spanish one.\n\nThe country also has a large number of indigenous languages, including Fang, Bube, Benga, Ndowe, Balengue, Bujeba, Bissio, Gumu and the nearly extinct Baseke. Most African ethnic groups speak Bantu languages.\n\nAlthough there is an Anglophone ethnic group in Bioko, standard English is spoken by few people, even in the capital city.\n\n==See==\nThere are lots of beaches so that would be a good thing to take in mind when considering sight-seeing. It would be advised to take precautions listed in the ''''Stay Safe'''' category.\n\nThere is NO tourist support in Equatorial Guinea.  To leave the immediate Malabo area you will need to find a reference from hotel staff.  Prices for a \u2018tour\u2019 of the island are shocking ($400/day), but keep talking until you get to $150.  Equipment can be a clapped out van.  To visit the two actually interesting parts of the island you have to go to the Ministry of Tourism and submit a detailed letter of request, then wait a minimum of 2 days for permission to be granted.  [Opinion]. There is actually nothing to see that is notably beautiful.\n\n==Do==\n\n==Buy==\n\n===Costs===\nEverything is extremely expensive in Equatorial Guinea. A decent room with very limited amenities (bring all the necessary stuff like towel, soap, shampoo, etc as the hotel may not have any) will be at the range of USD75 to USD300. A simple lunch will cost at least USD20 (without drinks like wine, beer or soft drinks) in a clean and air-conditioned restaurant.\n\n==Eat==\nThere are several good places to go to eat particularly in Malabo. The coffee shop at Hotel Sofitel (located just across the Cathedral along the north coast) offers French cuisine. Hotel Bahia's main restaurant is also a favourite destination for both local and expats. If you like pizza and pasta, the Pizza Place is the best place in town. For Asian cuisine, Restaurante Bantu offers authentic Chinese cuisine. For Morrocan and other European food, try La Luna. Try An Equatorial Guinean cuisine such smoked beef with a black pepper. There is also a roast duck with cheese and onion leaf.\n\n==Drink==\nEbebiyin is known for its large number of bars. They drink a lot of wine.\n\n==Sleep==\nDue to the influx of foreign workers and foreign investment in Malabo as well as in the continent, there is an ample choice of hotels.\n\nThere are very few tourists.  Nearly everyone who travels to EG is on an expense account, so hotel prices reflect this.\n\n==Learn==\n\n==Work==\n\n==Stay safe==\nDon't photograph airports, government buildings, or anything of military or strategic value. Local folks including children are generally averse to foreigners taking their picture. As a general rule, it is not advisable to bring a camera while walking around town as this can cause real trouble with the police. \n\nAvoid any and all conversation related to politics. Criticizing the government, and especially the president, will lead you into trouble. Your local contacts will most likely suffer an even worse fate. If you feel that you are being dragged into a political conversation, or if you are asked for your opinion regarding local politics, stay neutral and don't offer your opinions.\n\nEquatorial Guinea has tropical weather and is normally very hot.  It is best to wear lightweight clothing. Avoid wearing dark colours due to mosquito concerns.\n\nEquatorial Guinea despite being a country with enough resources and is the country with the highest economic growth in Africa, does not provide any legal certainty for European, American or Asian working within the country.\n\nYou must visit with a guide and need special permits in some locations. Consult  to the website of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where information using extended over the areas of risks.\n\nAn organized tour is recommended to avoid unpleasant situations with military checkpoints on the roads especially in the island of Bioko, where the presence of Westerners is obvious and therefore the risk is particularly evident.\n\nEquatorial Guinea is, overall, a safe place to visit, especially in Malabo and Bata.\n\n==Stay healthy==\n'''Food/Water:''' There are no drinkable or clean water sources in Equatorial Guinea. Travellers should drink only bottled water. Take care when consuming any fruits or vegetables that may have been washed or drinks that may contain ice cubes or 'water' additives such as coffee, tea, lemonade, etc.\n\n'''Wear Shoes:''' Beaches in Malabo and Bata are beautiful however, due to discarded trash and unsafe sand bugs it is a good idea to always wear shoes. This applies to walking on carpeted areas as well.\n\n'''Malaria Medicine:''' Malaria is a leading cause of death in this country. It is advised that visitors consult their doctor for malaria tablets.\n\n==Contact==\n\n{{outline}}\n{{isPartOf|Central_Africa}}\n{{Countryguide}}\n\n[[de:\u00c4quatorialguinea]]\n[[eo:Ekvatora Gvineo]]\n[[es:Guinea Ecuatorial]]\n[[fi:P\u00e4iv\u00e4ntasaajan Guinea]]\n[[fr:Guin\u00e9e \u00e9quatoriale]]\n[[hu:Egyenl\u00edt\u0151i-Guinea]]\n[[it:Guinea Equatoriale]]\n[[ja:\u8d64\u9053\u30ae\u30cb\u30a2]]\n[[nl:Equatoriaal-Guinea]]\n[[pl:Gwinea R\u00f3wnikowa]]\n[[pt:Guin\u00e9 Equatorial]]\n[[ru:\u042d\u043a\u0432\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0413\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0435\u044f]]\n[[sv:Ekvatorialguinea]]\n[[wts:Category:Equatorial Guinea]]\n\n\n[[WikiPedia:Equatorial Guinea]]\n[[World66:africa/equatorialguinea]]"

Terrorism and general violence happen and can be targeted toward Westerners. While violence has dropped a bit in comparison to past years, it still happens on occasion. Remain alert and monitor media before arriving and while in the area. Terrorist groups operate in the areas bordering Mali, Libya, and throughout northern Niger. If travel is unavoidable, consult expert guidance and only stay at hotels with an armed security presence. }}\n\n'''Niger''' (pronounced: /\u02c8na\u026ad\u0292\u0259r/) is an arid, landlocked country of the [[Sahel]] with a population of 16 million.  It is bordered by [[Algeria]], [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], [[Chad]] and [[Libya]].  Niger is a former French colony which was granted independence in 1960.  The land is mostly desert plains and dunes, with rolling savanna in the southeast.\n\n==Understand==\n\n===History===\nIn 1993, 35 years after independence from France, Niger held its first free and open elections. A 1995 peace accord ended a five-year Tuareg insurgency in the north. Coups in 1996 and 1999 were followed by the creation of a National Reconciliation Council that effected a transition to civilian rule by December 1999. In 2010 a coup d'\u00e9tat toppled the elected government, a military junta was set up, and elections were organized later that year.\n\n===Economy===\nNiger's economy centers on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, reexport trade, and increasingly less on uranium, because of declining world demand. The 50% devaluation of the West African franc in January 1994 boosted exports of livestock, cowpeas, onions, and the products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies on bilateral and multilateral aid \u2014 which was suspended following the April 1999 coup d'etat \u2014 for operating expenses and public investment. In 2000-01, the World Bank approved a structural adjustment loan of $105 million to help support fiscal reforms. However, reforms could prove difficult given the government's bleak financial situation. The IMF approved a $73 million poverty reduction and growth facility for Niger in 2000 and announced $115 million in debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Niger is the second poorest country in the world.\n\n==Regions==\n\n{{Regionlist\n| regionmap=Niger regions map.png\n| regionmaptext=\n| regionmapsize=500px\n\n| region1name=[[Northern Niger]]\n| region1color=#b9ba83\n| region1items=\n| region1description=\n\n| region2name=[[Southern Niger]]\n| region2color=#b5d29f\n| region2items=\n| region2description=\n\n| region3name=[[Southwestern Niger]]\n| region3color=#a1b28b\n| region3items=\n| region3description=\n\n}}\n\n==Cities==\n\n*[[Niamey]] \u2014 Capital & commercial center, possibly the least crowded/hectic capital in West Africa\n*[[Agadez]] \u2014 A mecca of trade along trans-Saharan trade routes for over five centuries, home to a magnificent palace and several mosques and a gateway to the nearby Air Mountains\n*[[Ayorou]] \u2014 Along picturesque section of the River Niger with one of Niger's best markets, and a starting point for river trips to Gaya\n*[[Diffa]] \u2014 Peul town between shifting sand dunes and disappearing swampland which serves as the gateway to SE Niger & Lake Chad\n*[[Dosso]] \u2014 has a small ethnic museum, colorful market and even more colorful chief's palace\n*[[Maradi]] \u2014 Center of agriculture (especially peanuts), home to a colorful chief's palace, and near seasonal rivers/floodplains which have caused interesting land formations to the south\n*[[Tahoua]] \u2014 Stop en route to Agadez\n*[[Zinder]] \u2014 The cultural capital of Niger, this Peul-Hausa city has perhaps the most colorful craft markets (pottery & tanning are local specialties) as well as a noteworthy regional museum and sultan's palace\n\n==Other destinations==\n* [[W National Park]] \u2014 magnificent National Park, easiest accessed from [[Niamey]]\n* [[Koure]] \u2014 See the last herd of giraffes in West Africa\n* [[Balleyara Market]] \u2014 Two hours from [[Niamey]], one of West Africa's largest animal markets, plus a colourful array of other traditional market and artisanal goods (Sundays) \n* [[Ayorou]] \u2014 A river-side town three hours from [[Niamey]] with a colourful, laid-back Sunday market as well as pirougue tours to see the hippos and islands\n* Boubon \u2014 Bar/restaurant and huts to rent nightly on an island in the Niger River\n* Termit & Tin Toumma National Nature and Cultural Reserve &mdash; one of Africa's largest reserves (twice as large as Costa Rica), the park protects several animals (including the critically endangered addax, Dama gazelle & desert cheetah), protects the nomadic culture and features lots of scenic desert landscape. Established in 2012, it will take a few years for guides, ecotours and facilities to become available.\n\n==Get in==\n===Visa===\n\nNationals of [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Chad]], [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]], the [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Liberia]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]], [[Morocco]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Togo]] and [[Tunisia]] may enter Niger visa-free.\n\nYou need a Yellow Fever vaccination certificate, proof of a round-trip airfare purchase, & a bank statement certifying that you have US$500 in your account.\n\n===By plane===\nTwo international airports: in [[Niamey]](NIM) and [[Agadez]].\n\n* [[Niamey]] has regularly scheduled flights from [[Europe]] and West Africa.\n* Air France is the only major carrier with direct flights from outside of Africa, but a regional airline, Point Air Niger flies weekly between France and Niamey.\n* Royal Air Maroc has good connections via [[Casablanca]]. \n* Charter flights from [[Paris]] and [[Marseille]] to [[Niamey]] and [[Agadez]]  (Point Afrique [http://www.point-afrique.com/] airlines, see ''vols charters'')\n* Air Algerie offers flights to Niamey from Algiers.\n\nThere are a few private companies and one mission aviation group (SIMAir) that operate charter flights from Niamey in small planes.\n\n===By car===\nTravellers can get to Niger overland by roads from Mali, Burkina Faso, Benin and Nigeria. It should be noted that Boko Haram is highly active in Northern Nigeria, and the Malian border is likewise notorious for illicit activities including but not limited to terrorism and kidnapping. Some adventurous souls still cross the Sahara from the north (Algeria), but that area is not secure. Technically, there is an Algerian border post at In Guezzam and a corresponding Nigerian one in Assamakka with a desert piste continuing to Arlit and then onto Agadez, but there is very little up-to-date information concerning this crossing, due to poor intergovernmental communication and the dearth of travelers foolhardy enough to venture into this part of Algeria.  Even less secure is the crossing over the porous and oftentimes violent border with Libya. Smugglers will oftentimes illegally transport migrants from Agadez into southern Libya, and it is theoretically possible, though emphatically not advised, to ride with them. Their overloaded trucks have been known to break down, be robbed, or crash, leaving scores of people wandering the desert with no food or water. Lorries filled with cargo that is easy to get in Libya yet scarce in Niger will occasionally cross legally into Niger from Libya, stamping passports and doing paperwork at the French military base in Madama, and they have been known to pick up passengers as well. However, all Libya and Algeria border crossings are best avoided as the risks of kidnapping, banditry, terrorism, and other illegal activities are very high in these regions.\n\n==Get around==\nThere are no railways in Niger.\n\nOf the 10,000 km of highways over 2000 km is paved and efforts are being made to improve some of the sections that have previously been in repair.  One can travel from Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso all the way to Diffa, near Lake Chad on roads in decent to tolerable condition. The road from Niamey to \"Park W\" in the south is paved. The Zinder-Agadez route is being repaved after being in severe disrepair for years.  The Birni Nkonni-Agadez-Arlit road is in poor shape.\n\nThe country has 27 airports/landing strips, 9 of which with paved runways.\n\nFrom mid-December to March the Niger River is navigable for about 300 km, from [[Niamey]] to [[Gaya]] on the Benin border.\n\nTaxis in Niamey run either 200 francs if the distance isn't too long, or 400 francs for going almost across the city. At the airport in Niamey though they have a monopoly and the lowest you'll get a taxi for is 3,000 francs, and that's if you haggle a lot. However, if you walk south from the airport you'll hit a main road and for 100 to 150F you can get a ride from a beat up van to the Grand Marche (Main Market), luggage included.\n\n===By bus===\nThe Nigerien government has recently set up a bus service along the major routes of the country.  While taking cars is exciting and interesting, they are dangerous, extremely hot, and more expensive.  Plus, they are forced to pull over after midnight due to banditry. Because these cars often only leave in the evening, it can take several days to travel a relatively short distance. The large buses are brand new Mercedes buses and they carry a soldier at night so they may drive all night long.  In addition, due to their large size, they can skim over potholes that would destroy the smaller vans.\n\n===Rent a car===\nThere is almost no possibility to rent a car in usual sense, although in 2005 a Hertz franchise came to Niamey and rents Toyota RAV4s. Also you can rent full-size cat-cat (4x4 SUV from French: ''quatre-quatre'') with a driver/guide, but in most cases you will have to arrange with companies that organise expeditions.\n* '''Tidene Expeditions''', BP 270 Agadez, +227 440568, fax: +227 440 578\n\n==Talk==\n[[French phrasebook|French]] is the ''lingua franca'' nationwide and Niger's \"official\" language for government, it is a second language for nearly all the population and is spoken with varying degrees of fluency. Nearly all travellers should be able to get by using French. There are eight \"national\" languages which are maternal languages of Nigeriens in various regions of the country. [[Hausa phrasebook|Hausa]] is the most spoken regional language; nearly 50% of all Nigeriens speak Hausa as their mother tongue, primarily in the south central and southeast of the country. [[Zarma phrasebook|Zarma]] is the second most spoken language with 2 million speakers (accounting for 25% of Nigeriens) in the southwest of the country. Tamajeq, the language of the Tuareg peoples, is spoken by nearly 10% of Nigeriens in the Saharan north of the country.\n\n==See==\n[[Image:Niamey_giraffes.jpg|thumb|250px|West Africa's last remaining wild Giraffe herd lives in Niger]]\nNiger has stunning natural beauty, especially in the Mountain ranges in the north of the country, but also houses a few old trading centers in the Sahara, such as Agadez and Zinder, that have a distinct mixture of arab/tuareg and black african culture. The Hausa architecture in those towns is also worth a visit for tourists.\nThe wild giraffe herd lives near Koure which is only around sixty kilometers from Niamey on a paved road. You will need a 4x4 vehicle and a guide however.  The giraffes live near many people and are rather curious and friendly.  You can approach within ten meters or so before they become more cautious.  The locals are also very friendly.  Don't be surprised if you are invited into someone's home.  In such circumstances a small gift would always be appreciated.\n\n==Do==\nVisit the elephants or else you have wasted your money.\n\n==Buy==\nNigerien artisanal specialties include: \n* intricately imprinted leather boxes (ranging from small 5cm boxes to full-size trunks)\n* other leather goods\n* silver jewellery.\n* colourful hand-woven wedding blankets\n* coloured straw mats\n* fabric (only the Enitex brand is made in Niger, but there are many other kinds that are also good)\nSee the [[Niamey]] section and the [[Balleyara]] section for sample prices of these goods and where to find them. \n\nThe currency used in Niger is the CFA Franc (FCFA \u2014 XOF) \u2014 pronounced \"say-fah\". US$1 = 504.62 FCFA (as of April 2013).\n\nATMs \u2014 Mastercard/ Maestro withdrawals are available at Banque Atlantique in Niamey. \n\nCredit cards are almost never accepted anywhere. \n\nForeign currency are not accepted as currency, only to exchange into local money via a bank or black market. Exception: near the border of Nigeria, Nigerian currency ''Naira'' is accepted.\n\nBargaining and haggling is essential and expected. It's best to have a low price and a maximum price in mind before entering into a negotiation. If the price is higher than you want, just say thanks and walk away: if you were offering a fair price you will be called back. If you were offering too low a price, you won't be called back, but you can always go back later and offer more.\n\n==Eat==\nLocal, traditional food includes: \n* a dense millet porridge with an okra sauce, a pepper sauce, a tomato sauce, or a squash sauce on top, sometimes with veggies and a couple chunks of meat\n* rice with the above sauces\n* mushy macaroni pasta with an oily red sauce\n* rice & beans\n* corn cous-cous mixed with moringa leaves, black-eyed peas, and sauce (called ''dumbou'' in Djera/Zarma, and only available in Djerma/Zarma regions)\n\nAvailability varies widely by region, but visitors may wish to try the following '''delicious''' specialties, usually available as street food: \n* ''dumbou'' (see above) \n* ''kilishi'': beef jerkey that comes in three flavors: regular, peanut-spiced, and hot-pepper-spiced\n* ''masa'': delicious sourdough pancakes eaten with a peanut/hot pepper/ginger spice mix or a brown sauce\n* ''fari masa'': fried dough balls served with either a squash/tomato salsa or sugar\n* ''chichena'': like fari masa above, but made from bean flour instead of wheat flour\n* ''koudagou'' (Djerma/Zarma): fried sweet potato chunks with sauce\n\nLess exotic but also tasty: \n* brochettes \u2014 meat kabobs made from either beef, lamb, or goat \n* omelet sandwiches\n* mangoes: if in season, they are bigger and juicier than any available in the western world\n* yogurt: pasteurized, sweet, and available wherever there is a fridge\n* fried fish sandwiches\n* ground beef sandwiches\n* plates of garlicky green beans or peas (usually in bars and restaurants) \n\nCareful of the salads \u2014 usually not ok for western travelers even in the city.\n\n==Drink==\n*'''Drink plenty of filtered or bottled water'''. You '''will''' get dehydrated during your trip to Niger at one point. At times it can be hard to find bottled water, but ask for \"Purewater\" (pronounced ''pure-wata'') that comes in sealed plastic bags for usually 25F (50F in some hard-to-reach places). You will also need to replenish your salts more frequently than you are accustomed. \n\nKeep in mind that '''drinking alcohol is generally forbidden in Muslim culture''', so take extra care to keep drunken inappropriate behavior behind closed doors and out of the public eye.\n\nThe national beer is called, appropriately, Biere Niger.  The only other locally produced beer is a franchise of the French West-African Flag brewery. While taste is in the eye of the beerholder, Biere Niger is decent. Both are brewed in the same tank from the same ingredients with the slightest variation on how much reconstituted malt they put in each batch. All other beer, boxed wine, and hard liquor is imported. \n\nIn rare pockets of the capital you can find millet beer homebrew, brewed by Burkinabe immigrants. This is drunk out of calabash gourd bowls. Some compare the taste to a dry, unsweetened cider. See the [[Niamey]] section for directions.\n\nLocally-made '''non-alcoholic drinks''' are delicious. Safety depends on the water quality: generally ok in the capital and NOT ok in rural areas. They are either sold by women out of their houses (ask around), by young girls from trays on their heads, or by young boys pushing around coolers. These drinks include: \n* ''lemu-hari'': a sweet lemony-gingery drink\n* ''bisap'': a dark red kool-aid-type drink made from hibiscus leaves\n* ''apollo'': a thick, pinkish-brownish drink made from the baobab fruit\n* ''degue'': sweet yogurt with small millet balls (like tapioca)\nTo drink, you bite the corner off the bag.\n\n==Talk==\nThe official language in Niger is [[French]], though very few people speak it outside Niamey, and even there do not expect a high level conversation with the traders at the markets. The local languages include Djerma (spoken mainly in Niamey and the bordering Tillaberi and Dosso regions), Hausa, Fulfulde and Tamashek (spoken by Tuaregs in north), and Kanuri (spoken by Beri Beri). English is of no use outside the American cultural center and a few big hotels of Niamey. However, you will find English-speakers in border towns along the Nigerian border, such as Birni N Konni and Maradi.  These people are usually from Nigeria to the south and in general want something from you.  As friendly as they may be, always listen to a professional guide over anyone that speaks some English.\n\nIf you learn about 20 phrases in a local language, you will gain respect in a heartbeat.  Simply greeting people in their local tongue will make your trip there smoother than you would have ever thought possible.      \n\n'''Top essential Zarma/Djerma phrases''': \n* ''Fofo'': hello\n* ''Mate ni go?'' (mah-tay nee go?): How are you?\n* ''Sah-mai'' (sawm-eye): Fine \n* ''Mano...?'' Where is...? \n* ''Ai ga ba...'' (Eye gah bah): I want... \n* ''Wo-nae:'' That one\n* ''Toe'': OK. \n* ''Ai (eye) MAH fah-ham'': I don't understand.\n* ''Ka-LA-tone-tone'': Goodbye\n\n'''Top essential Hausa phrases''': \n* ''Sannu'': Hello\n* ''Kana LA-hiya'': How are you? \n* ''LA-hiya LO'': It's all good. \n* ''Na GO-day'': Thank you\n* ''Sai ANjima'': Goodbye \n\n'''Some Arabic words are also common''': \n* ''salam-u-laikum'', which roughly means, \"peace be with you,\" and is used in Niger when you enter a house or greet someone\n* ''al hamdallaye'', which means to a Nigerien \"Bless it, it's finished.\" It can also mean \"no thank you.\" The latter can also get you out of having to sample possibly dirty food, or from eating at someone's home until your stomach explodes.\n* ''In-shah-allah'', which means \"God willing.\" For example, \"I'll come to visit your family in-shah-allah.\"\n\n==Learn==\n'''Patience'''.  If you haven't learned it before you went to Niger, you probably will.\n\n==Work==\nVolunteering would be your best bet here, as many people in the rural areas have been hit by drought.\n\n==Stay safe==\nNiger is politically unstable and therefore lawlessness is widespread. The latest coup d'etat in early 2010 increased the unstable situation and every traveller should follow independent news closely and stay in contact with their embassy. Also Al-Qaeda is present in Niger and kidnapped and killed tourists, so it is essential to know the off-limit regions and avoid them\n\nIn the region north of Agadez, there have been many carjackings, kidnappings and robberies in the past sixteen or so years. The problem continues to this day, and tourists should consider the area essentially lawless. You should not venture beyond Agadez even if you have a guide and a 4WD vehicle unless you seriously know what you are doing. The roads past this point are of terrible quality and banditti are abundant.\n\nAvoid driving late at night in a private vehicle. Occasionally armed robbers will operate near the town of Galmi (central Niger) and around Dosso-Doutchi (in western Niger), as well as on the road to Gao, Mali in the Tillabery region. Normally, there are police checkpoints on the main highways which limit criminal activities during the day.\n\nThe main annoyances you are likely to meet are young boys shouting \"Anasara,\" which means 'foreigner' in most local languages, derived from the Arabic word.  You will also be asked for a 'cadeau' pretty much every time you see a person outside your hotel.  The word is French for 'gift,' and it is best to remember not to perpetuate the misery this word causes to foreigners working in the country.\n\nIn Niamey the safety level is better. If you stay away from markets after dark and use taxis and are EXTRA careful to avoid where the streets cross ravines, you shouldn't run into any problems. In markets there is risk of pickpockets or handbag straps being cut but you are more likely to lose money by haggling poorly and in French.\n\nCarrying a backpack and camera, looking like a tourist, and especially being white, will definitely draw some unwanted attention. Most of the attention is from people who try to get your money legally, either by selling you a toothbrush or by begging, but there are always a few less honest people.\n\n==Stay healthy==\nThe Centers for Disease Control [http://www.cdc.gov/travel/wafrica.htm] is an excellent resource for authoritative advice on health issues for travelers to Niger.\n\nDrink lots and lots of water while in Niger because the dry heat will dehydrate you and you won't realize it.  It is the best preventative step you can take.  Bottled water or water sealed in a bag (called ''pure-wata'') is available in most of the cities but in a pinch, city tap water is well-chlorinated (this is according to one traveler; another American who lived in Niger for two years says never drink unfiltered water anywhere! \u2014 that includes ice!). Be particularly wary of well water, stream water, and rural water. \n\nBe sure to replenish your salts as well as liquids.\n\nWear loose conservative clothes, big hats, and lots of sunscreen. If in doubt, wear what the locals wear. \n\nMalaria, including encephaletic malaria, is a problem, and is chloroquine resistant in Niger [http://www2.ncid.cdc.gov/travel/yb/utils/ybGet.asp?section=YBOne&obj=NE&cssNav=browseoyb]. Take your prophylaxes, use heavy-duty insect repellent (DEET is best, though nasty), and consider carrying a mosquito net to sleep under. \n\nGiardia and amoebic dysentery are common. Be wary of any roadside food, unless you buy it hot off the grill.  Even items fried in oil could make you sick if the oil has been heavily used and is old.  Best to avoid salads and uncooked veggies. Also, never drink unfiltered water (including ice). \n\nSchistosomiasis is present in most water bodies in Niger, so travelers should avoid going in the water everywhere \u2014 except chlorinated swimming pools [http://www.cdc.gov/travel/wafrica.htm].\n\nIn case you were unable to stay healthy, the Clinique Pasteur (situated in front of the Lyc\u00e9e Fontaine) has clean facilities, sterile needles, and competent, sympathetic doctors. The Clinique Gamkalley and many other clinics are around, however, you may need to watch out for dirty needles, over-prescription and aggressive staff.\n\n==Respect==\nVisitors are treated as kings in Niger (there is a Koranic proverb to that effect), so be careful not to abuse the hospitality you will be shown.  For the most part, try to accept all the small tokens and gestures (cokes, tea, small gifts, etc.) that are offered to you during your time in Niger.  It really isn't good to refuse too much and don't think \"these people are too poor to give me these things\".  That is offensive as taking good care of guests is a point of honor and gives people great pleasure.  If you feel uncomfortable in regards to this custom offer gifts in exchange.  Nigeriens tend to be very friendly and love swapping stuff.  Don't comment out loud when you see poverty or things in disrepair and please don't remind Nigeriens about how poor their country is.  \n\nDress conservatively, which means no shorts, no skirts above the knees, and no tank tops. For women, dressing revealingly can be seen as very offensive, even in Niamey. Also, dress nicely, as clothes determine how well you are treated back. \n\nAvoid drunken behavior, since alcohol is prohibited in the Muslim religion and greatly frowned-upon in Niger. \n\nDon't eat while walking in the street, this is considered obscene. Even drinking water is just barely acceptable. If you are sitting together with others and you decide to eat or drink something, even if it's only a piece of fruit, offer to share with everyone. Most people will decline, but it is expected that you offer nonetheless.\n\nAlways ask people, especially camel drivers, market sellers, and the elderly, before taking a photograph. Many Nigeriens still find it offensive. Usualy they will demand payment for photos. \n\nSlavery is still relatively common in the central areas, away from the towns. You can generally spot slaves by the unadorned, solid ankle bracelets on both feet, which look like manacles and may well serve that purpose. Unless you feel particularly brave, discussion of the subject with either victims or perpetrators is probably best avoided.\n\n==Contact==\nSee the Friends of Niger website [http://www.friendsofniger.org] for discussion boards where you can ask questions before you go to Niger and maybe get some Nigeriens or others to fill you in.\n\n{{outline}}\n{{isPartOf|Sahel}}\n{{countryguide}}\n\n[[ca:N\u00edger]]\n[[de:Niger]]\n[[eo:Ni\u011dero]]\n[[es:N\u00edger]]\n[[fi:Niger]]\n[[fr:Niger]]\n[[hu:Niger]]\n[[it:Niger]]\n[[ja:\u30cb\u30b8\u30a7\u30fc\u30eb]]\n[[nl:Niger (land)]]\n[[pl:Niger]]\n[[pt:N\u00edger]]\n[[ru:\u041d\u0438\u0433\u0435\u0440]]\n[[sv:Niger]]\n[[zh:\u5c3c\u65e5\u5c14]]\n\n[[wts:Category:Niger]]\n\n[[WikiPedia:Niger]]\n[[Dmoz:Africa/Niger/]]\n[[World66:africa/niger]]"

Following Spain's defeat in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898, the islands were sold to [[Imperial Germany]] in 1899 under the terms of the [[German\u2013Spanish Treaty (1899)|German\u2013Spanish Treaty]], where they were administered as part of [[German New Guinea]], although the islands were already represented in the Malolos Congress of the revolutionary [[First Philippine Republic]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] conquered Palau during [[World War I]], and the islands were later made a part of the Japanese-ruled [[South Pacific Mandate]] by the [[League of Nations]]. During [[World War II]], skirmishes, including the major [[Battle of Peleliu]], were fought between American and Japanese troops as part of the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign]]. Along with other [[Pacific Islands]], Palau was made a part of the [[United States]]-governed [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] in 1947.

Legislative power is concentrated in the [[bicameral]] [[Palau National Congress]]. [[Economy of Palau|Palau's economy]] is based mainly on [[tourism]], [[subsistence agriculture]] and [[fishing]], with a significant portion of [[gross national product]] (GNP) derived from foreign aid. The country uses the [[United States dollar]] as its currency. The islands' culture mixes Micronesian, [[Melanesia]]n, Asian, and Western elements. Ethnic Palauans, the majority of the population, are of mixed Micronesian, Melanesian, and [[Austronesia]]n descent. A smaller proportion of the population is descended from [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] settlers. The country's two [[official language]]s are [[Palauan language|Palauan]] (a member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family) and [[English language|English]], with [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Sonsorolese language|Sonsorolese]], and [[Tobian language|Tobian]] recognized as [[regional language]]s.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name for the islands in the [[Palauan language]], ''Belau'', likely derives from either the Palauan word for \"village\", ''beluu'',<ref>[http://www.everyculture.com/No-Sa/Palau.html Culture of Palau] \u2013 Every Culture.

However, the Spanish presence only began to express with [[evangelization]], began at the end of the 17th century, and its dominance began to take shape in the 18th century.\n\n=== After 16th century ===\nThe conscious discovery of Palau came a century later in 1697 when a group of Palauans were shipwrecked on the Philippine island of [[Samar Island|Samar]] to the northwest. They were interviewed by the [[Czechs|Czech]] missionary [[Pablo Clain|Paul Klein]] on 28 December 1696. Klein was able to draw the first map of Palau based on the Palauans' representation of their home islands that they made with an arrangement of 87 pebbles on the beach. Klein reported his findings to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] Superior General in a letter sent in June 1697,<ref>{{cite book|author=Serrano, Andres |title=Los siete principes de los Angeles: validos del Rey del cielo.

Another letter written by Fr. Andr\u00e9s Serrano was sent to Europe in 1705, essentially copying the information given by Klein. The letters resulted in three unsuccessful Jesuit attempts to travel to Palau from [[Spanish Philippines]] in 1700, 1708 and 1709. The islands were first visited by the Jesuit expedition led by Francisco Padilla on 30 November 1710. The expedition ended with the stranding of the two priests, Jacques Du Beron and Joseph Cortyl, on the coast of Sonsorol, because the mother ship ''Sant\u00edsima Trinidad'' was driven to [[Mindanao]] by a storm. Another ship was sent from [[Guam]] in 1711 to save them only to capsize, causing the death of three more Jesuit priests. The failure of these missions gave Palau the original Spanish name ''Islas Encantadas'' (Enchanted Islands).<ref>[http://micsem.org/pubs/articles/religion/frames/cathmissionsfr.htm Francis X.

Palau, under the name ''Palaos'', was included in the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]], the first revolutionary congress in the [[Philippines]] which aimed to become fully independent from colonialists. Palau, at the time, was part of the Philippines. Palau had one appointed member to the Congress, becoming the only group of islands in the entire Caroline Islands to be granted high representation in a non-colonial Philippine Congress.

In 1945\u20131946, the United States re-established control on the [[Philippines]], and managed Palau through the Philippine capital of [[Manila]]. By the later half of 1946, however, the Philippines was granted full independence with the formation of the [[Third Republic of the Philippines]], shifting the US Far West Pacific capital to [[Guam]].

Its most populous [[island]]s are [[Angaur]], [[Babeldaob]], [[Koror]] and [[Peleliu]]. The latter three lie together within the same [[Coral reef|barrier reef]], while Angaur is an oceanic island several miles to the south. About two-thirds of the [[population]] lives on Koror.\n\nThe [[coral]] [[atoll]] of [[Kayangel]] is north of these islands, while the uninhabited [[Rock Islands (Palau)|Rock Islands]] (about 200) are west of the main island group. A remote group of six islands, known as the [[Southwest Islands (Palau)|Southwest Islands]], some {{convert|375|mi|km}} from the main islands, make up the states of Hatohobei and Sonsorol.\n\n===Climate===\n\nPalau has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] with an annual [[arithmetic mean|mean]] [[temperature]] of {{convert|28|C|abbr=on}}. [[Rainfall]] is heavy throughout the [[year]], averaging {{convert|3800|mm|abbr=on}}. The average [[humidity]] is 82% and, although rain falls more frequently between July and October, there is still much [[sunlight|sunshine]].\n\n[[Tropical cyclone|Typhoons]] are rare, as Palau lies outside the main typhoon zone. The strongest typhoon that struck Palau since reliable records was [[Typhoon Haiyan]] in [[2013 Pacific typhoon season|2013]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kitamoto|first1=Asanobu|title=Histogram of Typhoons Within 1 Degree of Koror|url=http://agora.ex.nii.ac.jp/cgi-bin/dt/view_hist.pl?lang=en&cmd=nn_pressure&basin=wnp&gid=40c8f127cdf990173254578948ac8291&lat=7.36&min=870&lon=134.48&quant=10|publisher=Digital Typhoon|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> A mandatory [[emergency evacuation]] was issued for [[Kayangel]].

As with other Pacific island nations, [[sea-level rise|rising sea level]] presents a major environmental threat. Inundation of low-lying areas threatens coastal [[vegetation]], [[agriculture]], and an already insufficient [[water supply]]. [[Wastewater treatment]] is a problem, along with the handling of [[toxic waste]] from [[fertilizer]]s and [[biocide]]s.\n\n[[Saltwater crocodile]]s are also indigenous to Palau and occur in varying numbers throughout the various [[mangrove]]s and in parts of the rock islands.

Remengesau, Jr. took the lead on a regional environmental initiative called the [[Micronesia challenge]], which would conserve 30% of near-shore coastal waters and 20% of [[forest|forest land]] by 2020. Following Palau, the initiative was joined by the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the [[Marshall Islands]], and the [[United States|U.S.]] [[territory (geographic region)|territories]] of [[Guam]] and [[Northern Mariana Islands]].

Among them, 398 held less than US$5,000, with the remainder ranging from US$5,000 to US$2 million. On 12 December 79 affected people received compensation. Mr. Toribiong said, \"The fund for the payout came from the balance of Palau government's loan from [[Taiwan]].\" From a total of US$1 million, which originally was for assisting Palau's development, US$955,000 was left at the time of bankruptcy. Toribiong requested the Taiwanese government use the balance to repay its loans. Taiwan agreed to the request.

Germans sent Roman Catholic and Protestant, Japanese sent Shinto and Buddhist, and Spaniards sent Roman Catholic missionaries as they controlled Palau. Three quarters of the population are [[Christians]] (mainly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] and [[Protestants]]), while [[Modekngei]] (a combination of Christianity, traditional Palauan religion and fortune telling) and the ancient Palauan religion are commonly observed. Japanese rule brought [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]] to Palau, which were the majority religions among Japanese settlers. However, following Japan's World War II defeat, the remaining Japanese largely converted to Christianity, while the remainder continued to observe Buddhism, but stopped practicing Shinto rites.<ref>Brigham Young University\u2014Hawaii Campus (1981), p. 36</ref> There are also approximately 400 Bengali Muslims in Palau, and recently a few [[Uyghurs]] detained in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]] were allowed to settle in the island nation.\n\n==Culture==\n{{See also|Music of Palau|Palauan language}}\n\n[[File:A traditional Palauan hut, 2012.jpg|thumb|A traditional Palauan house]]\nPalauan society follows a very strict [[matrilineal]] system. Matrilineal practices are seen in nearly every aspect of Palauan traditions, especially in funeral, marriage, inheritance and the passing of traditional titles. The system probably had its origins from the Philippine archipelago, which had a similar system until the archipelago was colonized by Spain.\n\nThe cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]]. [[Western cuisine]] is favored among young Palauans and the locals are joined by foreign tourists. The rest of Micronesia is similar with much less tourism, leading to fewer restaurants. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Tourists eat mainly at their hotels on such islands. Some local foods include an alcoholic drink made from coconut on the tree; the drink made from the roots of the [[kava]]; and the chewing of [[betel nut]]s.\n\nThe traditional government system still influences the nation's affairs, leading the federal government to repeatedly attempt to limit its power. Many of these attempts took the form of amendments to the constitution that were supported by the corporate sector to protect what they deemed should be free economic zones. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} One such example occurred in early 2010, where the Idid clan, the ruling clan of the Southern Federation, under the leadership of Bilung, the Southern Federation's queen, raised a civil suit against the Koror State Public Lands Authority (KSPLA). The Idid clan laid claim over Malakal Island, a major economic zone and Palau's most important port, citing documents from the German Era. The verdict held that the Island belonged to the KSPLA.\n\n===Traditional government===\nThe present-day \"traditional\" government of Palau is a continuation of its ancestor, composed of practices that span thousands of years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Traditionally, Palau was hierarchically organized. The lowest level is the village or hamlet, then the chiefdom (now politically referred to as a state) and finally alliances of chiefdoms. In ancient times, numerous federations divided power, but upon the 17th century introduction of firearms by the British, an imbalance of power occurred.\n\nPalau became divided into northern and southern federations. The Northern Federation is headed by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling clan Uudes of Melekeok state, the Reklai and Ebilreklai. They are commonly referred to as the king and queen of the Northern Federation. This northern federation comprises the states of Kayangel, Ngerchelong, Ngardmau, Ngiwal, Ngaraard, Ngatpang, Ngeremlengui, Melekok, Aimeliik, Ngchesar and Airai. The Southern Federation is likewise represented by the high chief and chiefess of the ruling Idid of Koror state.\n\nThe Southern Federation comprises the states of Koror, Peleliu and Angaur. However, fewer and fewer Palauans have knowledge of the concept of federations, and the term is slowly dying out. Federations were established as a way of safeguarding states and hamlets who shared economic, social, and political interests, but with the advent a federal government, safeguards are less meaningful. However, in international relations, the king of Palau is synonymous with the Ibedul of Koror. This is because Koror is the industrial capital of the nation, elevating his position over the Reklai of Melekeok.\n\nIt is a misconception that the king and queen of Palau, or any chief and his female counterpart for that matter, are married. Traditional leaders and their female counterparts have always been related and unmarried (marrying relatives was a traditional taboo). Usually, a chief and his female counterpart are brother and sister, or close cousins, and have their own spouses.\n\n===Sports===\n{{See also|Baseball in Palau}}\n\n[[Baseball]] is a popular sport in Palau after its introduction by the Japanese in the 1920s. The [[Palau national baseball team]] won the gold medal at the [[1990 Micronesian Games|1990]], [[1998 Micronesian Games|1998]] and [[2010 Micronesian Games]], as well as at the [[2007 Pacific Games]].\n\nPalau also has a [[Palau national football team|national football team]], organized by the [[Palau Soccer Association]], but is not a member of [[FIFA]]. The Association also organizes the [[Palau Soccer League]].\n\n===Education===\n\nPrimary education is required until age of 16. Schools include both public and private institutions as well as some fields of study available at [[Palau Community College]]. For further undergraduate, graduate and professional programs, students travel abroad to attend tertiary institutions. Popular choices among Palauan scholars include the [[San Diego State University]], [[University of the Philippines]], [[Mindanao State University]], and the [[University of the South Pacific]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/countries/Palau/Education-System|title=Palau Education System|website=www.classbase.com|access-date=21 June 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{Wikinews|Bones of \"small-bodied humans\" found in cave}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{See also|List of Oceanian cuisines}}\n\nPalau has its own cuisine, for instance, a dessert called ''tama''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ayearcookingtheworld.com/tag/tama/|title=Tama \u2013 A Year Cooking the World|website=ayearcookingtheworld.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-24}}</ref>\nPalauan cuisine includes local foods such as [[cassava]], [[taro]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[potato]], [[fish]] and [[pork]].

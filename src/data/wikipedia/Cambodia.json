(1992) ''History of Cambodia''. Boulder, CO: Westview Press, {{ISBN|0813335116}}.</ref> This marked the beginning of the [[Khmer Empire]], which flourished for over 600 years, allowing successive kings to control and exert influence over much of Southeast Asia and accumulate immense power and wealth. The [[Indianised kingdom]] facilitated the spread of first [[Hinduism]] and then [[Buddhism]] to much of Southeast Asia and undertook many religious infrastructural projects throughout the region, including the construction of more than 1,000 temples and monuments in [[Angkor]] alone. [[Angkor Wat]] is the most famous of these structures and is designated as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\nAfter the fall of Angkor to [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] in the 15th century, a reduced and weakened Cambodia was then ruled as a [[vassal state]] by its neighbours. In 1863, Cambodia became a [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|protectorate of France]], which doubled the size of the country by reclaiming the north and west from Thailand.\n\nCambodia gained independence in 1953. The [[Vietnam War]] extended into the country with the US bombing of Cambodia from [[Operation Menu|1969]] until [[Operation Freedom Deal|1973]]. Following the [[Cambodian coup of 1970]] which installed the right-wing pro-US [[Khmer Republic]], the deposed king gave his support to his former enemies, the [[Khmer Rouge]]. The Khmer Rouge emerged as a major power, taking Phnom Penh in 1975 and later carrying out the [[Cambodian genocide]] from 1975 until 1979, when they were ousted by Vietnam and the Vietnamese-backed [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]], supported by the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cambodian\u2013Vietnamese War]] (1979\u201391).\n\nFollowing the [[1991 Paris Peace Accords]], Cambodia was governed briefly by a [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|United Nations mission]] (1992\u201393). The UN withdrew after [[Cambodian general election, 1993|holding elections]] in which around 90 percent of the registered voters cast ballots. The [[1997 clashes in Cambodia|1997 factional fighting]] resulted in the ousting of the government by Prime Minister [[Hun Sen]] and the [[Cambodian People's Party]], who remain in power {{As of|2018|lc=y}}.\n\nCambodia is a member of the [[United Nations]] since 1955, [[ASEAN]], the [[East Asia Summit]], the [[WTO]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|La Francophonie]].

In Cambodia, some Iron Age settlements were found beneath [[Baksei Chamkrong]] and other Angkorian temples while circular earthworks were found beneath ''Lovea'' a few kilometres north-west of Angkor. Burials, much richer than other types of finds, testify to improvement of food availability and trade (even on long distances: in the 4th century BC trade relations with India were already opened) and the existence of a social structure and labour organisation.\nAlso, among the artefacts from the Iron Age, glass beads are important evidence. Different kinds of glass beads recovered from several sites across Cambodia, such as the Phum Snay site in northwest and the Prohear site in southeast,  show that there were two main trading networks at the time.

By this time, the Khmer penchant for monument building had ceased. Older faiths such as [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and the [[Hindu]] cult of the god-king had been supplanted by Theravada Buddhism.\n\nThe court moved the capital to [[Longvek]] where the kingdom sought to regain its glory through maritime trade.  The first mention of Cambodia in European documents was in 1511 by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. Portuguese travellers described the city as a place of flourishing wealth and [[foreign trade]]. The attempt was short-lived however, as continued wars with Ayutthaya and the Vietnamese resulted in the loss of more territory and [[Siamese\u2013Cambodian War (1591\u20131594)|Longvek being conquered and destroyed]] by King [[Naresuan|Naresuan the Great]] of Ayutthaya in 1594. A new Khmer capital was established at [[Oudong]] south of Longvek in 1618, but its monarchs could survive only by entering into what amounted to alternating [[vassal]] relationships with the Siamese and Vietnamese for the next three centuries with only a few short-lived periods of relative independence.\n\nThe [[Khmer Leu|hill tribe]] people in Cambodia were \"hunted incessantly and carried off as [[Slavery in Asia|slaves]] by the Siamese (Thai), the Annamites (Vietnamese), and the Cambodians\".{{attribution needed|date=April 2018}}<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20101009132129/http://kyotoreviewsea.org/slavery4.htm Slavery in Nineteenth-Century Northern Thailand (Page 4 of 6)]\".

Upon his father's death in 1960, Sihanouk again became head of state, taking the title of prince. As the [[Vietnam War]] progressed, Sihanouk adopted an official policy of [[neutral country|neutrality]] in the [[Cold War]]. Sihanouk allowed the Vietnamese communists to use Cambodia as a sanctuary and a supply route for their arms and other aid to their armed forces fighting in South Vietnam. This policy was perceived as humiliating by many Cambodians. In December 1967 Washington Post journalist Stanley Karnow was told by Sihanouk that if the US wanted to bomb the Vietnamese communist sanctuaries, he would not object, unless Cambodians were killed.<ref>Washington Post, 29 December 1967</ref>\n\nThe same message was conveyed to [[Lyndon B.

Lon Nol remained in power in part because neither of the others was prepared to take his place. In 1972, a constitution was adopted, a parliament elected, and Lon Nol became president. But disunity, the problems of transforming a 30,000-man army into a national combat force of more than 200,000 men, and spreading corruption weakened the civilian administration and army.\n\nThe Communist insurgency inside Cambodia continued to grow, aided by supplies and military support from North Vietnam. Pol Pot and [[Ieng Sary]] asserted their dominance over the Vietnamese-trained communists, many of whom were purged. At the same time, the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea|CPK]] forces became stronger and more independent of their Vietnamese patrons. By 1973, the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea|CPK]] were fighting battles against government forces with little or no North Vietnamese troop support, and they controlled nearly 60% of Cambodia's territory and 25% of its population. The government made three unsuccessful attempts to enter into negotiations with the insurgents, but by 1974, the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea|CPK]] were operating openly as divisions, and some of the NVA combat forces had moved into South Vietnam. Lon Nol's control was reduced to small enclaves around the cities and main transportation routes. More than 2 million refugees from the war lived in [[Phnom Penh]] and other cities.\n\nOn New Year's Day 1975, Communist troops launched an offensive which, in 117 days of the hardest fighting of the war, collapsed the Khmer Republic. Simultaneous attacks around the perimeter of Phnom Penh pinned down Republican forces, while other [[Communist Party of Kampuchea|CPK]] units overran fire bases controlling the vital lower Mekong resupply route. A US-funded airlift of ammunition and rice ended when Congress refused additional aid for Cambodia. The Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh surrendered on 17 April 1975, just five days after the US mission evacuated Cambodia.<ref>Short, Philip (2004) ''Pol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare'', Henry Holt & Co.:  New York, p. 4, {{ISBN|0805080066}}.</ref>\n\n===Khmer Rouge regime, 1975\u20131978===\n{{Main|Democratic Kampuchea|Khmer Rouge}}\n[[File:TuolSlang3.jpg|thumb|Rooms of the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] contain thousands of photos taken by the Khmer Rouge of their victims.]]\n[[File:Buddhist Stupa at Choeung Ek killing fields, Cambodia.JPG|thumb|[[Choeung Ek]], a known site of mass grave for genocide victims during the Khmer Rouge era]]\n\nThe Khmer Rouge reached [[Phnom Penh]] and took power in 1975.

Cambodia's population is largely homogeneous. Its minority groups include [[Chams]] (1.2%), [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] (0.1%) and [[Chinese Cambodian|Chinese]] (0.1%).<ref name=\"CIACB\"/>\n\nThe largest ethnic group in Cambodia are the [[Khmer people|Khmers]], who comprise around 90% of the total population in Cambodia, and are indigenous to the lowland Mekong subregion in which they inhabit. The Khmers historically have lived near the [[Mekong River|lower Mekong River]] in a contiguous diagonal arc, from where modern-day Thailand, Laos and Cambodia meet in the northwest, all the way to the mouth of the [[Mekong River]] in southeastern Vietnam.\n\nThe Vietnamese are the second largest ethnic minority in Cambodia, with an estimated 16,000 living in provinces concentrated in the southeast of the country adjacent to the [[Mekong Delta]]. Although the Vietnamese language has been determined to be a [[Mon\u2013Khmer]] language, there are very few cultural connections between the two peoples because the early Khmers were influenced by the [[Indian cultural sphere]] while the Vietnamese are part of the [[Adoption of Chinese literary culture|Chinese cultural sphere]].<ref name=\"David Chandler 2000\">{{cite book |author=Chandler, David |title=A History of Cambodia |publisher=Westview Press|date=2000}}</ref> Due to Chinese influence, Vietnamese has developed into a solidly tonal language, while Khmer has preserved the non-tonal nature of Old Austroasiatic.

Most are urban dwellers, engaged primarily in commerce.\n\nThe indigenous ethnic groups of the mountains are known collectively as Montagnards or [[Khmer Loeu]], a term meaning \"Highland Khmer\". They are descended from neolithic migrations of Mon\u2013Khmer speakers via southern China and [[Austronesian]] speakers from insular Southeast Asia.  Being isolated in the highlands, the various Khmer Loeu groups were not Indianized like their Khmer cousins and consequently are culturally distant from modern Khmers and often from each other, observing many pre-Indian-contact customs and beliefs.\n\nThe Cham are descended from the [[Austronesian]] people of [[Champa]], a former kingdom on the coast of central and southern present-day Vietnam and former rival to the Khmer Empire. The Cham in Cambodia number under a million and often maintain separate villages in the southeast of the country.

The country also boasts various distinct local street foods, such as [[fried spider]]s.\n\nFrench influence on Cambodian cuisine includes the Cambodian red curry with toasted [[baguette]] bread. The toasted baguette pieces are dipped in the curry and eaten. Cambodian red curry is also eaten with rice and [[rice vermicelli]] noodles.

Native sports include [[Dragon boat|traditional boat racing]], buffalo racing, [[Pradal Serey]], [[Khmer traditional wrestling]] and [[Bokator]]. Cambodia first participated in the Olympics during the [[Cambodia at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympic Games]] sending [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|equestrian]] riders.

The exact origins of Khmer classical dance are disputed. Most native Khmer scholars trace modern dance forms back to the time of [[Angkor]], seeing similarities in the temple engravings of the period, while others hold that modern Khmer dance styles were learned (or re-learned) from Siamese court dancers in the 1800s.\n\nKhmer classical dance is the form of stylised performance art established in the royal courts of Cambodia exhibited for both entertainment and ceremonial purposes.<ref name=UnescoDance>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?RL=00060 |title=UNESCO Culture Sector \u2013 Intangible Heritage \u2013 2003 Convention : |publisher=Unesco.org |accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref> The dances are performed by intricately costumed, highly trained men and women on public occasions for tribute, invocation or to enact traditional stories and epic poems such as [[Reamker]], the Khmer version of the [[Ramayana]].<ref name=Cravath1968>{{cite journal|author=Cravath, Paul |year=1986|jstor=1124400 |doi=10.2307/1124400|title=The Ritual Origins of the Classical Dance Drama of Cambodia|journal=Asian Theatre Journal|volume=3|issue=2|pages=179\u2013203}}</ref> Known formally as ''Robam Preah Reach Trop'' ({{lang|km|\u179a\u1794\u17b6\u17c6\u1796\u17d2\u179a\u17c7\u179a\u17b6\u1787\u1791\u17d2\u179a\u1796\u17d2\u1799}} \"theater of royal wealth\") it is set to the music of a [[pinpeat]] ensemble accompanied by a vocal chorus.\n\nCambodian folk dance, often performed to [[mahori]] music, celebrates the various cultural and ethnic groups of Cambodia. Folk dances originated in the villages and are performed, for the most part, by the villagers for the villagers.<ref name=FolkDance>[[Sam-Ang Sam|Sam, Sam-ang]] & Sam, Chan Moly (Winter 2003) [https://web.archive.org/web/20090915000000*/http://www.reninc.org/BOOKSHELF/Khmer_Folk_Dance_Sam.pdf Khmer Folk Dance], Khmer Studies Institute; Newington, CT; {{ISBN|0-941785-02-5}}</ref> The movements are less stylised and the clothing worn is that of the people the dancers are portraying, such as hill tribes, [[Cham people (Asia)|Chams]] or farmers. Typically faster-paced than classical dance, folk dances display themes of the \"common person\" such as love, comedy or warding off evil spirits.<ref name=FolkDance/>\n\nSocial dances are those performed by guests at banquets, parties or other informal social gatherings. Khmer traditional social dances are analogous to those of other Southeast Asian nations. Examples include the [[circle dance]]s [[Romvong]] and [[Romkbach]] as well as ''Saravan'' and ''Lam Leav''. Modern western popular dances including [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|Cha-cha]], [[Bolero]], and the [[Madison (dance)|Madison]], have also influenced Cambodian social dance.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Cambodia}}\n[[File:27523 117616998271166 8494 n.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sinn Sisamouth]], a famous Cambodian singer]]\nTraditional Cambodian music dates back as far as the [[Khmer empire|Khmer Empire]].<ref name=umbc>[http://www.umbc.edu/eol/cambodia/histcmus.htm Cambodian music history]. umbc.edu</ref> Royal dances like the [[Apsara]] Dance are icons of the Cambodian culture as are the Mahori ensembles that accompany them. More rural forms of music include ''Chapei'' and ''A Yai''. The former is popular among the older generation and is most often a solo performance of a man plucking a Cambodian guitar (''chapei'') in between [[a cappella]] verses. The lyrics usually have moral or religious theme.\n\n''A Yai'' can be performed solo or by a man and woman and is often comedic in nature. It is a form of lyrical poetry, often full of double entendres, that can be either scripted or completely impromptu and [[Ad libitum|ad-libbed]]. When sung by a duo, the man and women take turns, \"answering\" the other's verse or posing riddles for the other to solve, with short instrumental breaks in between verses. ''Pleng kaah'' (lit. \"wedding music\") is a set of traditional music and songs played both for entertainment and as accompaniment for the various ceremonial parts of a traditional, days-long Khmer wedding.\n\nCambodian popular music is performed with western style instruments or a mixture of traditional and western instruments. Dance music is composed in particular styles for social dances. The music of crooner [[Sinn Sisamouth]] and [[Ros Sereysothea]] from the 1960s to the 1970s is considered to be the classic pop music of Cambodia. During the [[Khmer rouge|Khmer Rouge Revolution]], many classic and popular singers of the 1960s and 1970s were murdered, starved to death, or overwork to death by the Khmer Rouge.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ringer|first=Greg|title=Killing Fields|year=2002|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|pages=368\u2013370}}</ref> and many original master tapes from the period were lost or destroyed.\n\nIn the 1980s, Keo Surath, (a refugee resettled in the United States) and others carried on the legacy of the classic singers, often remaking their popular songs. The 1980s and 1990s also saw the rise in popularity of ''[[kantrum]]'', a music style of the [[Northern Khmer people|Khmer Surin]] set to modern instrumentation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/country/content.country/cambodia_527 |title=Cambodia : National Geographic World Music |publisher=Worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com |date=17 October 2002 |accessdate=16 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818104047/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/country/content.country/cambodia_527 |archivedate=18 August 2012 }}</ref>\n\nThe Australian [[hip hop]] group Astronomy Class has recorded with Kak Channthy, a native born Cambodian female singer.<ref>{{cite news|title=The show must go on tour|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/7days/show-must-go-tour|accessdate=18 July 2013|newspaper=The Phnom Penh Post|date=21 June 2013|author=Knox, Claire }}</ref><ref name=\"Will\">{{cite news|title=7 Questions with Shannon Kennedy|url=http://www.phnompenhpost.com/7days/7-questions-shannon-kennedy|accessdate=12 May 2014|newspaper=The Phnom Penh Post|date=2 May 2014|author=Jackson, Will }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Dengue Fever (band)|Dengue Fever]] rock and roll band features a Cambodian female singer and back-up band from California.

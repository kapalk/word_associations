Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]]. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]]. Trujillo and [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias]] were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries.\n\n===Spanish Honduras (1524\u20131821)===\nHonduras was organized as a province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]] and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at [[Comayagua]], and finally at [[Tegucigalpa]] in the central part of the country.\n\n[[Silver mining]] was a key factor in the Spanish conquest and settlement of Honduras.<ref name=Newson1>{{cite journal\n|last=Newson\n|first=Linda\n|title=Labour in the Colonial Mining Industry of Honduras\n|date=October 1982 |volume=39\n|journal=The Americas\n|doi=10.2307/981334\n|issue=2\n|pages=185\u2013203\n|jstor=981334|registration=yes\n}}</ref>  Initially the mines were worked by local people through the [[encomienda]] system, but as disease and resistance made this option less available, slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in.

They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s|Puerto Caballos]] and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]] in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of [[Jamaica]], which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.\n\n[[File:Exterior Fuerte de Omoa Honduras.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa|Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa]] was built by the Spanish to protect the coast of Honduras from English pirates.]]\n\n===Independence (1821)===\nHonduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] until 1823, when it became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]]. It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842\u20131845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849\u20131852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.\n\n[[Neoliberal]] policies favoring [[international trade]] and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital, [[Tegucigalpa]], ran out of money when it reached [[San Pedro Sula]]. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city. [[Comayagua]] was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa.\n\nSince independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of r\u00e9gime.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===20th century and the role of American companies===\nIn the late nineteenth century, Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in [[Banana production in Honduras|banana plantations]] and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], as well as the [[United Fruit Company]], and [[Standard Fruit Company]], built an [[enclave economy]] in northern Honduras, controlling [[infrastructure]] and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth.

Rural areas generally have basic drinking water systems with limited capacity for water treatment. Many urban areas have sewer systems in place to collect wastewater, but proper treatment of wastewater is rare. In rural areas sanitary facilities are generally limited to latrines and basic septic pits.\n\nWater and sanitation services were historically provided by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Servicio Aut\u00f3nomo de Alcantarillas y Aqueductos|es}} (SANAA). In 2003, the government enacted a new \"water law\" which called for the [[decentralization]] of water services. Under the 2003 law, local communities have both the right and the responsibility to own, operate, and control their own drinking water and wastewater systems. Since this law passed, many communities have joined together to address water and sanitation issues on a regional basis.\n\nMany national and international non-government organizations have a history of working on water and sanitation projects in Honduras.

The triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: \"Republic of Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent\".\n\nThe \"[[National Anthem of Honduras]]\" is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of [[Manuel Bonilla]]. In the end, it was the poet [[Augusto Coello]] that ended up writing the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer [[Carlos Hartling]] writing the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during the presidency of {{Interlanguage link multi|Alberto de Jes\u00fas Membre\u00f1o|es|3=Alberto Membre\u00f1o}}.

The change of the national flower was carried out during the administration of general [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano]], thinking that ''Brassavola digbyana'' \"is an indigenous plant of Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor and distinction\", as the decree dictates it.\n\nThe national tree of Honduras was declared in 1928 to be simply \"the Pine that appears symbolically in our [[Coat of Arms]]\" (''el Pino que figura simb\u00f3licamente en nuestro Escudo''),<ref>Acuerdo No. 429, 14 de mayo de 1928.</ref> even though [[pine]]s comprise a [[genus]] and not a [[species]], and even though legally there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the coat of arms ''either''. Because of its commonality in the country, the ''[[Pinus oocarpa]]'' species has become since then the species most strongly associated as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated as the national tree is the ''[[Pinus caribaea]]''.\n\nThe national mammal is the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), which was adopted as a measure to avoid excessive depredation.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.\nThe national bird of Honduras is the [[scarlet macaw]] (''Ara macao''). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian civilizations of Honduras.\n\n===Folklore===\nLegends and fairy tales are paramount in Honduran culture. [[Lluvia de Peces]] (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. The legends of El [[Cadejo]] and [[La Llorona]] are also popular.\n\n===Sports===\nThe major sports in Honduras are football, basketball, rugby, volleyball and cycling, with smaller followings for athletics, softball and handball.

({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Togo.ogg|\u02c8|t|o\u028a|\u0261|o\u028a}}), officially the '''Togolese Republic''' ({{lang-fr|R\u00e9publique togolaise}}), is a country in [[West Africa]] bordered by [[Ghana]] to the west, [[Benin]] to the east and [[Burkina Faso]] to the north. The [[sovereign state]] extends south to the [[Gulf of Guinea]], where its [[capital city|capital]] [[Lom\u00e9]] is located. Togo covers {{convert|57,000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}}, making it one of the smallest countries in Africa, with a population of approximately {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Togo}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}}\n\nFrom the 11th to the 16th century, various tribes entered the region from all directions. From the 16th century to the 18th century, the coastal region was a major trading center for Europeans to search for slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]\". In 1884, [[German Empire|Germany]] declared a region including present-day Togo as a protectorate called [[Togoland]]. After [[World War I]], rule over Togo was transferred to [[France]]. Togo gained its independence from France in 1960.<ref name=\"cia\"/> In 1967, [[Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]] led a successful military coup d'\u00e9tat after which he became president of an anti-communist, single-party state. Eventually in 1993, Eyad\u00e9ma faced multiparty elections, which were marred by irregularities, and won the presidency three times. At the time of his death, Eyad\u00e9ma was the longest-serving leader in modern African history, having been president for 38 years.<ref name=Obituary>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/830774.stm \"Obituary: Gnassingbe Eyadema\"].

While the official language is French, many other languages are spoken in Togo, particularly those of the [[Gbe languages|Gbe family]]. The largest [[religious denomination|religious group]] in Togo consists of those with indigenous beliefs, and there are significant [[Christians|Christian]] and [[Muslim]] minorities. Togo is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[African Union]], [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], [[South Atlantic Peace and Cooperation Zone]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], and [[Economic Community of West African States]].\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Togo}}\n\n=== Before colonization (-1884) ===\nArchaeological finds indicate that ancient tribes were able to produce [[pottery]] and process [[iron]]. The name Togo is translated from the [[Ewe language]] as \"land where lagoons lie\". Not much is known of the period before arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in 1490. During the period from the 11th century to the 16th century, various tribes entered the region from all directions: the [[Ewe people|Ew\u00e9]] from the east, and the [[Gen language|Mina]] and [[Fon language|Gun]] from the west. Most of them settled in coastal areas.\n\nThe [[slave trade]] began in the 16th century, and for the next two hundred years the coastal region was a major trading centre for Europeans in search of slaves, earning Togo and the surrounding region the name \"The [[Slave Coast of West Africa|Slave Coast]]\".\n\n=== Colonial era (1884\u20131960) ===\n{{Main article|Togoland|British Togoland|French Togoland}}\n[[File:Togoland.jpg|thumb|left|Togoland ([[Rudolf Hellgrewe|R. Hellgrewe]], 1908)]]\n\nIn 1884, a paper was signed at [[Togoville]] with the King Mlapa III, whereby Germany claimed a [[protectorate]] over a stretch of territory along the coast and gradually extended its control inland. Its borders were defined after the capture of hinterland by German forces and signing agreements with France and Britain. In 1905, this became the [[German colonial empire|German colony]] of [[Togoland]]. The local population was forced to work, cultivate cotton, coffee and cocoa and pay high taxes. A railway and the port of [[Lom\u00e9]] were built for export of agricultural products. The Germans introduced modern techniques of cultivation of [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]] and [[cotton]] and developed the infrastructure.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Togoland was invaded by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]], proclaiming the Anglo-French condominium. On 7 December 1916 the condominium collapsed and Togo was divided into British and French zones. 20 July 1922 Great Britain received the [[League of Nations]] mandate to govern the western part of Togo and France to govern the eastern part. In 1945, the country received the right to send three representatives to the French parliament.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], these mandates became [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territories]]. The residents of [[British Togoland]] voted to join the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] as part of the new independent nation of [[Ghana]] in 1957. [[French Togoland]] became an autonomous republic within the [[French Union]] in 1959, while France retained the right to control the defense, foreign relations and finances.\n\n=== Independence to present day (1960\u2013present) ===\n[[File:Sylvanus Olympio.jpg|thumb|[[Sylvanus Olympio]]|left]]\n\nThe Togolese Republic was proclaimed on 27 April 1960.  In the [[Togolese general election, 1961|first presidential elections]] in 1961, [[Sylvanus Olympio]] became the first president, gaining 100% of the vote in elections boycotted by the opposition. On 9 April 1961 the Constitution of the Togolese Republic was adopted, according to which the supreme legislative body was the [[National Assembly of Togo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn December 1961, leaders of opposition parties were arrested because they were accused of the preparation of an anti-government conspiracy. A decree was issued on the dissolution of the opposition parties. Olympio tried to reduce dependence on France by establishing cooperation with the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]] and [[Germany]]. He also rejected efforts of French soldiers who were demobilized after the [[Algerian War]] and tried to get a position in the Togolese army. These factors eventually led to a military coup on 13 January 1963, during which he was [[assassinate]]d by a group of soldiers under the direction of Sergeant [[Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]].<ref name=\"ellis93\">{{cite journal | last = Ellis | first = Stephen | title = Rumour and Power in Togo | journal = Africa: Journal of the International African Institute | volume = 63 | issue = 4 | pages = 462\u2013476 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1993 | jstor = 1161002 }}</ref> A State of emergency was declared in Togo.\n\nThe military handed over power to an interim government led by [[Nicolas Grunitzky]]. In May 1963 Grunitzky was [[Togolese general election, 1963|elected]] President of the Republic. The new leadership pursued a policy of developing relations with France. His main aim was to dampen the divisions between north and south, promulgate a new constitution, and introduce a multiparty system.\n\nExactly four years later, on 13 January 1967, Eyad\u00e9ma Gnassingb\u00e9 overthrew Grunitzky in a bloodless coup and assumed the presidency. He created the [[Rally of the Togolese People|Rally of the Togolese People Party]], banned activities of other political parties and introduced a one-party system in November 1969. He was reelected in [[Togolese general election, 1979|1979]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 1986|1986]]. In 1983, the [[privatization]] program launched and in 1991 other political parties were allowed. In 1993, the EU froze the partnership, describing Eyadema's re-election in [[Togolese presidential election, 1993|1993]], [[Togolese presidential election, 1998|1998]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 2003|2003]], as a seizure of power. In April 2004, in Brussels, talks were held between the [[European Union]] and Togo on the resumption of cooperation.\n\nEyad\u00e9ma Gnassingb\u00e9 suddenly died on 5 February 2005 after 38 years in power, the longest occupation of any dictator in Africa. The military's immediate installation of his son, [[Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]], as president provoked widespread international condemnation, except from France. Some democratically elected African leaders such as [[Abdoulaye Wade]] of [[Senegal]] and [[Olusegun Obasanjo]] of [[Nigeria]] supported the move, thereby creating a rift within the [[African Union]].<ref name=\"bbc.co.uk\">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14106781 BBC News \u2013 Togo country profile \u2013 Overview].

The opposition declared that the election results were fraudulent. The events of 2005 led to questions regarding the government's commitment to [[democracy]] that had been made in an attempt to normalize relations with the [[European Union|EU]], which cut off [[aid]] in 1993 due to questions about Togo's human rights situation. In addition, up to 400 people were killed in the violence surrounding the presidential elections, according to the [[United Nations|UN]]. Around 40,000 Togolese fled to neighboring countries. [[Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]] was reelected in [[Togolese presidential election, 2010|2010]] and [[Togolese presidential election, 2015|2015]].\n\nIn late 2017, [[Anti-government protests in Togo, 2017|anti-government protests]] erupted in Togo, the biggest since ones after the [[Togolese presidential election, 2005|2005 election]]. They demand the resignation of Gnassingb\u00e9, who is part of a family they say has been in power too long. The UN has condemned the resulting crackdown by Togolese security forces, and [[The Gambia|Gambia's]] foreign minister, [[Ousainou Darboe]], had to issue a correction after saying that Gnassingb\u00e9 should resign.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-togo/togos-president-gnassingbe-should-resign-immediately-gambian-foreign-minister-idUSKBN1CS1W7|title=Gambian ministry says up to Togo to resolve crisis|last=Farge|first=Emma|date=2017-10-23|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-10-26|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:To-map.png|right|thumb|Map of Togo]]\n{{Main|Geography of Togo}}\nTogo has an area equal to {{convert|21925|sqmi|km2|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and is one of the smallest countries in Africa. It borders the [[Bight of Benin]] in the south; [[Ghana]] lies to the west; [[Benin]] to the east; and to the north, Togo is bound by [[Burkina Faso]]. Togo lies mostly between latitudes [[6th parallel north|6\u00b0]] and [[11th parallel north|11\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[prime meridian|0\u00b0]] and [[2nd meridian east|2\u00b0E]].\n\nThe coast of Togo in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] is 56&nbsp;km long and consists of lagoons with sandy beaches. In the north the land is characterized by a gently rolling [[savanna]] in contrast to the center of the country, which is characterized by hills. The south of Togo is characterized by a [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic|savanna and woodland plateau]] which reaches to a coastal plain with extensive lagoons and marshes.\n\nThe highest [[mountain]] of the country is the [[Mont Agou]] at 986 m above sea level. The longest [[river]] is the [[Mono River]] with a length of 400&nbsp;km. It runs from north to south.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{main|Climate of Togo}}\nThe climate is generally tropical with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|23|\u00b0C}} on the coast to about {{convert|30|\u00b0C}} in the northernmost regions, with a dry climate and characteristics of a [[tropical savanna]]. To the south there are two seasons of rain (the first between April and July and the second between September and November), even though the average rainfall is not very high.\n\n=== Flora and fauna ===\nThe coast of Togo is characterized by [[marshes]] and [[mangroves]]. High human population growth is leading to rapid [[deforestation]], endangering many species. At least four parks and reserves have been established: [[Abdoulaye Faunal Reserve]], [[Fazao Malfakassa National Park]], [[Fosse aux Lions National Park]], [[Koutammouko]], and [[K\u00e9ran National Park]]. The most frequently observed animals are [[giraffes]], [[cape buffalo]], [[hyenas]], and [[lions]]. Few elephants remain. Common [[birds]] are [[storks]], [[Crane (bird)|cranes]] and [[Marabou stork|marabou]].\n\n== Government ==\n{{Main|Politics of Togo}}\n[[File:Faure Gnassingb\u00e9 2014.png|thumb|upright|Current president of Togo [[Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]] since 2005]]\n[[File:Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyadema, 1972.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]] ruled Togo from 1967 until his death in 2005]]\n\nThe President is elected by universal and direct suffrage for 5 years. He is also the commander of the [[Togolese Armed Forces|armed forces]] and has the right to initiate legislation and dissolve [[parliament]]. Executive power is exercised by the president and the government. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who is appointed by the president.\n\nTogo's transition to democracy is stalled. Its democratic institutions remain nascent and fragile. President [[Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma]], who ruled Togo under a one-party system, died of a heart attack on 5 February 2005. Gravely ill, he was being transported by plane to a foreign country for care. He died in transit while over Tunisia. Under the Togolese Constitution, the President of the Parliament, [[Fambar\u00e9 Ouattara Natchaba]], should have become President of the country, pending a new presidential election to be called within sixty days. Natchaba was out of the country, returning on an Air France plane from Paris.<ref name=\"BBC News\">{{cite news | title = Togo: Africa's democratic test case | publisher = BBC News | date = 11 February 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4243477.stm | accessdate = 15 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Togolese army, known as Forces Arm\u00e9es Togolaises (FAT), or [[Togolese Armed Forces]], closed the nation's borders, forcing the plane to land in nearby Benin. With an engineered power vacuum, the Parliament voted to remove the constitutional clause that would have required an election within sixty days, and declared that Eyadema's son, [[Faure Gnassingb\u00e9]], would inherit the presidency and hold office for the rest of his father's term.<ref name=\"BBC News\"/> Faure was sworn in on 7 February 2005, despite international criticism of the succession.<ref>{{cite news | title = Togo leader sworn in amid protest | publisher = BBC News | date = 7 February 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4243629.stm | accessdate = 15 November 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe African Union described the takeover as a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4241001.stm |title=Togo succession 'coup' denounced |publisher=BBC News |date=6 February 2005 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> International pressure came also from the [[United Nations]].

Cotton is the most important cash crop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefactfile.org/togo-facts/|title=The Fact File|website=factfile.org|accessdate=2018-08-06}}</ref> The fertile land occupies 11.3% of the country, most of which is developed. Major crops are [[cassava]], [[jasmine rice]], [[corn]] and [[millet]]. Other important sectors are [[brewery]] and the [[textile]] industry. A permanent problem is the lack of [[electricity]], because the country is able to produce only about a third of its consumption, the rest is covered by imports from [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]]. Low market prices for Togo's major export commodities, however, coupled with the volatile political situation of the 1990s and early 2000s, had a negative effect on the economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://britannica.com/place/Togo#toc55354|title=Britannica|website=Britannica.org|accessdate=2017-08-26}}</ref>\n\nTogo is one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]]; the economic situation is still precarious. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government's decade-long efforts, supported by the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), to carry out economic reforms, to encourage investment, and to create the balance between income and consumption has stalled. Political unrest, including private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, jeopardized the reform program, shrank the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity.\n\nTogo imports [[machinery]], equipment, [[petroleum]] products, and [[food]]. Main import partners are [[France]] (21.1%), the [[Netherlands]] (12.1%), [[C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] (5.9%), [[Germany]] (4.6%), [[Italy]] (4.4%), [[South Africa]] (4.3%) and [[China]] (4.1%). The main exports are [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[coffee]], re-export of goods, [[phosphates]] and [[cotton]]. Major export partners are [[Burkina Faso]] (16.6%), [[China]] (15.4%), the [[Netherlands]] (13%), [[Benin]] (9.6%) and [[Mali]] (7.4%).\n\nIn terms of structural reforms, Togo has made progress in the [[liberalization]] of the economy, namely in the fields of [[trade]] and port activities. However, the privatization program of the cotton sector, [[telecommunications]] and water supply has stalled. The country currently has no debt due to financial assistance from the outside while Togo is likely among the most beneficiary countries under the Initiative help in [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]].\n\n12 January 1994 devaluation of the currency by 50% provided an important impetus to renewed structural adjustment; these efforts were facilitated by the end of strife in 1994 and a return to overt political calm. Progress depends on increased openness in government financial operations (to accommodate increased social service outlays) and possible downsizing of the [[armed forces]], on which the regime has depended to stay in place. Lack of aid, along with depressed cocoa prices, generated a 1% fall in GDP in 1998, with growth resuming in 1999.

Agriculture generated 28.2% of [[GDP]] in 2012 and employed 49% of the working population in 2010. The country is essentially [[self-sufficient]] in food production.

Since the mid-90s, however, there has been a decline in the mining industry and government will need to invest heavily to sustain it. The mining industry is facing difficulties due to falling phosphate prices on world markets and increasing foreign competition. There are also reserves of [[limestone]], [[marble]] and [[salt]]. \n\nIndustry provides only 20.4% of Togo's national income, because it consists only of a few light industries and builders.

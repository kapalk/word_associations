[[West Indies]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]] at the southern end of the [[Grenadines]] island chain. Grenada consists of the island of Grenada itself plus six smaller islands which lie to the north of the main island. It is located northwest of [[Trinidad and Tobago]], northeast of [[Venezuela]] and southwest of [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. Its size is {{convert|348.5|km2|sqmi}}, and it had an estimated population of {{UN_Population|Grenada}}{{UN_Population|ref}} in {{UN_Population|Year}}. Its capital is [[St. George's, Grenada|St. George's]]. Grenada is also known as the \"Island of Spice\" due to its production of [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]] crops, of which it is one of the world's largest exporters. The [[List of national birds|national bird]] of Grenada is the [[critically endangered]] [[Grenada dove]].\n\nBefore the [[European colonization of the Americas|arrival of Europeans in the Americas]], Grenada was inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] [[Arawaks]] and later by the [[Island Caribs]]. [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted Grenada in 1498 during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] to the Americas. Although it was deemed the property of the [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]], there are no records to suggest the Spanish ever landed or settled on the island. Following several unsuccessful attempts by Europeans to colonise the island due to resistance from the Island Caribs, [[French colonial empire|French]] settlement and colonisation began in 1650 and continued for the next century. On 10 February 1763, Grenada was ceded to the [[British Empire|British]] under the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]]. British rule continued, except for a [[French capture of Grenada 1779|period of French rule]] between 1779 and 1783, until 1974. From 1958 to 1962, Grenada was part of the [[Federation of the West Indies]], a short-lived federation of [[British West Indies|British West Indian colonies]]. On 3 March 1967, Grenada was granted full autonomy over its internal affairs as an [[Associated state|Associated State]]. [[Herbert Blaize]] was the first Premier of the Associated State of Grenada from March to August 1967. [[Eric Gairy]] served as [[Premier of Grenada#Premier of Associated state of Grenada (1967-1974)|Premier]] from August 1967 until February 1974.\n\nIndependence was granted on 7 February 1974, without breaking formal ties with the Commonwealth, under the leadership of [[Eric Gairy]], who became the first [[List of heads of government of Grenada|Prime Minister of Grenada]], with Queen Elizabeth as Head of State. In March 1979, the [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] [[New Jewel Movement]] overthrew Gairy's government in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] and established the [[People's Revolutionary Government]] (PRG), headed by [[Maurice Bishop]] as Prime Minister. On 19 October 1983, hard-line Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]] and his wife Phyllis, backed by the Grenadian Army, led a coup against the government of Maurice Bishop and placed Bishop under [[house arrest]]. Bishop was later freed by popular demonstration and attempted to resume power, but he was captured and executed by soldiers, and replaced with a military council chaired by [[Hudson Austin]]. On 25 October 1983, forces from the [[United States]] and the [[Barbados]]-based [[Regional Security System]] (RSS) invaded Grenada in a U.S.-led operation code-named ''[[US invasion of Grenada|Operation Urgent Fury]]''. The invasion was highly criticised by the governments of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[Canada]], along with the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Elections were held in December 1984 and were won by the [[Grenada National Party]] under [[Herbert Blaize]], who served as Prime Minister until his death in December 1989.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origin of the name \"Grenada\" is obscure, but it is likely that [[Spain|Spanish]] sailors renamed the island for the city of [[Granada]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs4ntEW202sC&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=grenada%20name|title=Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique|last=Crask|first=Paul|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|year=|isbn=9781841622743|location=|page=5|language=en}}</ref> By the beginning of the 18th century, the name \"Grenada\", or \"la Grenade\" in [[French language|French]], was in common use.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qfqwcul7MPMC&pg=PT11#v=onepage&q=grenada%20name|title=Grenada Uncovered: An Uncommon View of the Island's Geocultural Beauty|last=Viechweg|first=Raymond D.|date=2017-04-05|publisher=Trafford Publishing|year=|isbn=9781426926051|location=|page=11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] to the region in 1498, [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted Grenada and named it \"La Concepci\u00f3n\" in honour of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]]. It is said that he may have actually named it \"Assumpci\u00f3n\", but it is uncertain, as he is said to have sighted what are now Grenada and Tobago from a distance and named them both at the same time. However, history has accepted that it was Tobago he named \"Assumpci\u00f3n\" and Grenada he named \"La Concepci\u00f3n\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1499, the Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]] travelled through the region with the Spanish explorer [[Alonso de Ojeda]] and mapmaker [[Juan de la Cosa]]. Vespucci is reported to have renamed the island \"Mayo\", which is how it appeared on maps for around the next 20 years.\n\nIn the 1520s, the Spanish named the islands to the north of Mayo as ''Los Granadillos'' (Little Granadas), presumably after the mainland Spanish town. Shortly after this, Mayo disappeared from Spanish maps and an island called \"Granada\" took its place. Although it was deemed the property of the [[Monarchy of Spain|King of Spain]], there are no records to suggest the Spanish ever landed or settled on the island.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gs4ntEW202sC&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q=grenada%20name|title=Grenada, Carriacou and Petite Martinique|last=Crask|first=Paul|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|date=2009-01-01|isbn=9781841622743|location=|page=6|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter French settlement and colonisation in 1652, the French named their colony \"La Grenade\".

Grenada was inhabited by [[Arawaks]] and, subsequently, [[Island Caribs]] before it was invaded and colonized by Europeans. [[Christopher Columbus]] sighted Grenada in 1498 during his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|third voyage]] to the new world.\n\n===French colony (1649\u20131763)===\n{{Main|French West Indies}}\n\nIn 1649 a French expedition of 203 men from [[Martinique]] led by Jacques du Parquet founded a permanent settlement on Grenada. Within months this led to conflict with the local islanders which lasted until 1654 when the island was completely subjugated by the French.<ref>''Grenada. A History of its People''.

The French named their [[French colonial empires|new colony]] La Grenade, and the economy was initially based on [[sugar cane]] and [[indigo]]. The French established a capital known as [[St George's, Grenada|Fort Royal]] (later St. George). To shelter from hurricanes the French navy would often take refuge in the capital's natural harbour, as no nearby French islands had a natural harbour to compare with that of Fort Royal. The British captured Grenada during the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1762.\n\n===British colony (1763\u20131974)===\n{{Main|British West Indies|British Windward Islands|West Indies Federation}}\n\nGrenada was formally ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. The French [[French capture of Grenada 1779|re-captured the island]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], after [[Comte d'Estaing]] won the bloody land and naval [[Battle of Grenada]] in July 1779. However the island was restored to Britain with the [[Peace of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] in 1783. Britain was hard pressed to overcome a pro-French revolt in 1795\u201396 led by [[Julien Fedon]].\n\nNutmeg was introduced to Grenada in 1843 when a merchant ship called in on its way to England from the East Indies. The ship had a small quantity of nutmeg trees on board which they left in Grenada, and this was the beginning of Grenada's nutmeg industry that now supplies nearly 40% of the world's annual crop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelgrenada.com/gcna.htm |title=Grenada Nutmeg \u2013 GCNA \u2013 Organic Nutmeg Producers, Nutmeg Oil \u2013 Nutmeg trees \u2013 Nutmeg farming in Grenada |publisher=Travelgrenada.com |accessdate=2012-03-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323091337/http://www.travelgrenada.com/gcna.htm |archive-date=2012-03-23 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 1877 Grenada was made a [[Crown colony]]. Theophilus A. Marryshow founded the Representative Government Association (RGA) in 1917 to agitate for a new and participative constitutional dispensation for the Grenadian people. Partly as a result of Marryshow's lobbying, the Wood Commission of 1921\u201322 concluded that Grenada was ready for constitutional reform in the form of a modified Crown colony government. This modification granted Grenadians the right to elect five of the 15 members of the Legislative Council, on a restricted property franchise enabling the wealthiest 4% of adult Grenadians to vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bigdrumnation.org/comments/crowncolony.html |title=From Old Representative System to Crown Colony |publisher=Bigdrumnation.org |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref> Marryshow was named a [[1943 Birthday Honours#Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)|Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1943]].\n\n===Toward independence (1950\u20131974)===\nIn 1950 [[Eric Gairy]] founded the [[Grenada United Labour Party]], initially as a [[trades union]], which led the 1951 [[general strike]] for better working conditions. This sparked great unrest\u2014so many buildings were set ablaze that the disturbances became known as the \"red sky\" days\u2014and the British authorities had to call in military reinforcements to help regain control of the situation.

Gairy's party won elections in 1976. The opposition did not accept the result, accusing it of fraud.\n\nIn March 1979, the New Jewel Movement launched a [[coup]] which removed Gairy, suspended the constitution, and established a [[People's Revolutionary Government]] (PRG), headed by [[Maurice Bishop]] who declared himself prime minister. His [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] government established close ties with [[Cuba]], Nicaragua, and other [[communist bloc]] countries. All political parties except for the New Jewel Movement were banned and no elections were held during the four years of PRG rule.\n\n===Invasion by the United States (1983)===\n{{main|Invasion of Grenada}}\n[[File:Eastern Caribbean Defense Force.jpg|thumb|Members of the Eastern Caribbean Defence Force during the 1983 [[invasion of Grenada]]]]\n\n====Coup and execution of Maurice Bishop====\nSome years later a dispute developed between Bishop and certain high-ranking members of the NJM. Though Bishop cooperated with [[Cuba]] and the [[USSR]] on various trade and foreign policy issues, he sought to maintain a \"non-aligned\" status. Bishop had been taking his time making Grenada wholly [[socialist]], encouraging private-sector development in an attempt to make the island a popular tourist destination. Hardline [[Marxist]] party members, including [[communist]] Deputy Prime Minister [[Bernard Coard]], deemed Bishop insufficiently revolutionary and demanded that he either step down or enter into a power-sharing arrangement.\n\nOn October 19, 1983, Bernard Coard and his wife Phyllis, backed by the Grenadian Army, led a coup against the government of Maurice Bishop and placed Bishop under [[house arrest]].  These actions led to street demonstrations in various parts of the island.  Bishop had enough support from the population that he was eventually freed after a demonstration in the capital.  When Bishop attempted to resume power, he was captured and executed by soldiers along with seven others, including government cabinet ministers.{{clarify|reason=were the cabinet ministers the executors or the executees?|date=December 2018}}  The Coard regime then put the island under martial law.\n\nAfter the execution of Bishop, the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Grenada)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (PRA) formed a Military-Marxist government with General [[Hudson Austin]] as chairman. The army declared a four-day total curfew, during which anyone leaving their home without approval would be shot on sight.<ref>{{cite news |author=Anthony Payne, Paul Sutton and Tony Thorndike |title=Grenada: Revolution and Invasion |year=1984 |work=[[Croom Helm]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3agOAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=2009-09-10}}</ref>\n\n====United States and allied response and reaction====\n[[File:M102 howitzers during Operation Urgent Fury.jpg|thumb|M102 howitzers of [[320th Field Artillery Regiment]] firing during the 1983 [[invasion of Grenada]]]]\nThe overthrow of a moderate government by one which was strongly pro-communist worried the administration of US President [[Ronald Reagan]].

Eighteen members of the PRG and the PRA (army) were arrested after the invasion on charges related to the murder of Maurice Bishop and seven others. The eighteen included the top political leadership of Grenada at the time of the execution as well as the entire military chain of command directly responsible for the operation that led to the executions. Fourteen were [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]], one was found not guilty and three were sentenced to 45 years in prison. The death sentences were eventually commuted to terms of imprisonment. Those in prison have become known as the [[Grenada 17]].\n\n===Grenada since 1983===\nWhen US troops withdrew from Grenada in December 1983, [[Nicholas Brathwaite]] of the [[National Democratic Congress (Grenada)|National Democratic Congress]] was appointed prime minister of an interim administration by Scoon until elections could be organised. The first democratic elections since 1976 were held in December 1984, and were won by the [[Grenada National Party]] under [[Herbert Blaize]] who served as prime minister until his death in December 1989.\n\n[[Ben Jones (Grenada)|Ben Jones]] succeeded Blaize as prime minister and served until the March 1990 election, which was won by the National Democratic Congress under Nicholas Brathwaite who returned as prime minister for a second time until he resigned in February 1995. He was succeeded by [[George Brizan]] who served until the June 1995 election which was won by the [[New National Party (Grenada)|New National Party]] under [[Keith Mitchell]] who went on to win the 1999 and 2003 elections and served for a record 13 years until 2008.\n\nIn 2000\u201302, much of the controversy of the late 1970s and early 1980s was once again brought into the public consciousness with the opening of the [[truth and reconciliation commission]]. The commission was chaired by a [[Holy Orders|Roman Catholic priest]], Father Mark Haynes, and was tasked with uncovering injustices arising from the PRA, Bishop's regime, and before.

Most small ecofriendly guesthouses are located in the [[Saint David Parish, Grenada|Saint David]] and [[Saint John Parish, Grenada|Saint John]] parishes. The tourism industry is increasing dramatically with the construction of a large cruise ship pier and esplanade. Up to four cruise ships per day were visiting St. Georges in 2007\u20132008 during the cruise ship season.\n\nTourism is concentrated in the southwest of the island, around St. George, Grand Anse, Lance Aux Epines, and Point Salines. Grenada has many idyllic beaches around its coastline including the {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long Grand Anse Beach in St George which is considered to be one of the finest beaches in the world and often appears in countdowns of the world's top ten beaches.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/core/Slideshow/slideshowContentFrameFragXL.jhtml?xml=/travel/slideshow/bestbeaches/pixbestbeaches1.xml&site= |title=The 10 Best Beaches in the World |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> Besides these excellent beaches, tourists' favourite points of interest yet in Grenada are the waterfalls.

A small percentage of descendants of indentured workers from India were brought to Grenada mainly from the North Indian states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh between May 1, 1857 \u2013 January 10, 1885. Today, Grenadians of Indian descent comprise the second largest ethnic group. There is also a small community of French and English descendants. The rest of the population is of mixed descent (13%<ref name=\"cia.gov\" />).\n\nGrenada, like many of the Caribbean islands is subject to a large amount of migration, with a large number of young people wanting to leave the island to seek life elsewhere. With estimated {{UN_Population|Grenada}}&nbsp;people living in Grenada, estimates and census data suggest that there are at least that number of Grenadian-born people in other parts of the Caribbean (such as Barbados and Trinidad) and at least that number again in [[First World]] countries. Popular migration points for Grenadians further north include [[New York City]], [[Toronto]], the [[United Kingdom]] (in particular, [[London]] and [[Yorkshire]]; see [[Grenadian British|Grenadians in the UK]]) and sometimes [[Montreal]], or as far south as [[Australia]]. This means that probably around a third of those born in Grenada still live there.

Grenadian Creole French is mainly known as [[Patois]] or [[French-based creole languages|Creole]].\n\nSome [[Hindi]]/[[Bhojpuri]] terms are still spoken amongst the Indian descendants, mostly those pertaining to the kitchen; such as ''aloo, geera, karela, seim, chownkay, and baylay.'' The term ''bhai'', which means \"brother\" in [[Urdu]] and Hindi, is a common form of greeting amongst [[Indo-Grenadians]] males of equal status.\n\nThe indigenous languages were [[I\u00f1eri language|I\u00f1eri]] and [[Karina language|Karina]] (Carib).\n\n==Culture==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n{{main|Culture of Grenada|Music of Grenada}}\n[[File:GrenadaCarnival1965FeatheredHeaddresses.jpg|thumb|1965 carnival]]\n\nAlthough French influence on Grenadian culture is much less visible than on some other [[Caribbean islands]], surnames and place names in French remain, and the everyday language is laced with French words and the local dialect, or Patois. Stronger French influence is found in the well seasoned [[Spice|spicy food]] and styles of cooking similar to those found in [[New Orleans]], and some French architecture has survived from the 1700s. Island culture is heavily influenced by the [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] roots of most of the Grenadians, but [[India]]n and [[Island Caribs|Carib Amerindian]] influence is also seen with [[Dal|dhal]] puri, rotis, Indian sweets, cassava and curries in the cuisine.\n\nThe \"oildown\" is considered to be the national dish. The name refers to a dish cooked in coconut milk until all the milk is absorbed, leaving a bit of coconut oil in the bottom of the pot. Early recipes call for a mixture of salted pigtail, pig's feet (trotters), salt beef and chicken, dumplings made from flour, and provision like breadfruit, green banana, yam and potatoes. [[Callaloo]] leaves are sometimes used to retain the steam and add extra flavour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.gd/articles/grenada_oil_down.html |title=Oil down \u2013 National Dish of Grenada |publisher=Gov.gd |date=2010-03-05 |accessdate=2012-03-19}}</ref>\n\n[[Soca music|Soca]], [[Calypso music|calypso]], and [[reggae]] set the mood for Grenada's annual [[Carnival]] activities. Over the years [[rap]] music became famous among Grenadian youths, and there have been numerous young rappers emerging in the island's underground rap scene. [[Zouk]] is also being slowly introduced onto the island. The islanders' African and Carib Amerindian heritage plays an influential role in many aspects of Grenada's culture.\n\nAn important aspect of the Grenadian culture is the tradition of [[Storytelling|story telling]], with [[Folklore|folk tale]]s bearing both African and French influences. The character, ''[[Anansi|Anancy]]'', a spider who is a [[trickster]], originated in [[West Africa]] and is prevalent on other islands as well.

In December 1532, a party of ''[[conquistador]]s'' led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] defeated and captured the Inca Emperor Atahualpa  in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]. The Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire was one of the most important campaigns in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. After years of preliminary exploration and military conflicts, it was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory and colonization of the region known as the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] with its capital at [[Lima]], which became known as \"The City of Kings\". The conquest of the Inca Empire led to spin-off campaigns throughout the viceroyalty as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin as in the case of Spanish efforts to quell Amerindian resistance. The last Inca resistance was suppressed when the Spaniards annihilated the [[Neo-Inca State]] in [[Vilcabamba, Peru|Vilcabamba]] in 1572.\n[[File:Machu Picchu, Peru.jpg|thumb|The citadel of [[Machu Picchu]], an iconic symbol of pre-Columbian Peru.]]\nThe indigenous population dramatically collapsed due to exploitation, socioeconomic change and epidemic diseases introduced by the Spanish.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1992.tb01968.x|jstor=2563354|author=Lovell, W.

With the conquest started the spread of Christianity in South America; most people were forcefully converted to Catholicism, taking only a generation to convert the population. They built churches in every city and replaced some of the Inca temples with churches, such as the [[Coricancha]] in the city of Cusco. The church employed the [[Inquisition]], making use of torture to ensure that newly converted Catholics did not stray to other religions or beliefs.

The [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was rendered meaningless between 1580 and 1640 while [[Iberian Union|Spain controlled Portugal]].

As the elite vacillated between emancipation and loyalty to the Spanish Monarchy, [[independence of Peru|independence]] was achieved only after the occupation by military campaigns of [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].\n\nThe economic crises, the loss of power of Spain in Europe, the war of independence in North America and native uprisings all contributed to a favorable climate to the development of emancipating ideas among the [[Criollo people|''criollo'']] population in South America. However, the criollo oligarchy in Peru enjoyed privileges and remained loyal to the Spanish Crown. The liberation movement started in [[Argentina]] where autonomous juntas were created as a result of the loss of authority of the Spanish government over its colonies.\n\nAfter fighting for the independence of the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata, [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] created the [[Army of the Andes]] and crossed the Andes in 21 days, one of the greatest accomplishments in military history. Once in Chile he joined forces with Chilean army General [[Bernardo O'Higgins]] and liberated the country in the battles of [[Battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]] and [[Battle of Maip\u00fa|Maip\u00fa]] in 1818.<ref>Scheina, 2003, ''Latin America's Wars: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791\u20131899'', p. 58.</ref> On 7 September 1820, a fleet of eight warships arrived in the port of [[Paracas (municipality)|Paracas]] under the command of general Jose de San Martin and [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]], who was serving in the Chilean Navy. Immediately on 26 October they took control of the town of [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]]. San Martin settled in [[Huacho]] on 12 November, where he established his headquarters while Cochrane sailed north blockading the port of Callao in Lima. At the same time in the north, [[Guayaquil]] was occupied by rebel forces under the command of Gregorio Escobedo. Because Peru was the stronghold of the Spanish government in South America, San Martin's strategy to liberate Peru was to use diplomacy. He sent representatives to Lima urging the [[Viceroy]] that Peru be granted independence, however all negotiations proved unsuccessful.\n\n[[File:Congreso_1822.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Congreso_1822.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constituent Congress of Peru, 1822|First Constituent Congress of Peru]] in the chapel of the [[National University of San Marcos]] on 22 September 1822]]\n\nThe Viceroy of Peru, [[Joaqu\u00edn de la Pezuela, 1st Marquess of Viluma|Joaqu\u00edn de la Pazuela]] named [[Jos\u00e9 de la Serna e Hinojosa|Jose de la Serna]] commander-in-chief of the loyalist army to protect Lima from the threatened invasion of San Martin. On 29 January, de la Serna organized a coup against de la Pazuela which was recognized by Spain and he was named Viceroy of Peru. This internal power struggle contributed to the success of the liberating army. In order to avoid a military confrontation San Martin met the newly appointed viceroy, Jose de la Serna, and proposed to create a constitutional monarchy, a proposal that was turned down. De la Serna abandoned the city and on 12 July 1821 San Martin occupied Lima and declared Peruvian independence on 28 July 1821. He created the first Peruvian flag. [[Alto Peru]] (Bolivia) remained as a Spanish stronghold until the army of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] liberated it three years later. Jose de San Martin was declared Protector of Peru. Peruvian national identity was forged during this period, as Bolivarian projects for a [[Congress of Panama|Latin American Confederation]] floundered and a [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation|union with Bolivia]] proved ephemeral.<ref>Gootenberg (1991) p. 12.</ref>[[File:La Independencia del Per\u00fa.jpg|thumb|upright=0.95|San Mart\u00edn proclaiming the independence of Peru.

Bolivia invoked its alliance with Peru against Chile. The [[Peruvian Government]] tried to mediate the dispute by sending a diplomatic team to negotiate with the Chilean government, but the committee concluded that war was inevitable. Chile declared war on 5 April 1879. Almost five years of war ended with the loss of the [[Tarapac\u00e1 Department (Peru)|department of Tarapac\u00e1]] and the provinces of [[Tacna Province|Tacna]] and [[Arica Province (Peru)|Arica]], in the Atacama region. Two outstanding military leaders throughout the war were [[Francisco Bolognesi]] and [[Miguel Grau Seminario|Miguel Grau]]. Originally Chile committed to a referendum for the cities of Arica and Tacna to be held years later, in order to self determine their national affiliation. However, Chile refused to apply the Treaty, and neither of the countries could determine the statutory framework. After the War of the Pacific, an extraordinary effort of rebuilding began. The government started to initiate a number of social and economic reforms in order to recover from the damage of the war. Political stability was achieved only in the early 1900s.\n\n=== 20th century ===\n[[File:Protocolo de R\u00edo.jpg|thumb|The signing of the [[Rio Protocol]] in January 1942]]\nInternal struggles after the war were followed by a period of stability under the [[Civilista Party]], which lasted until the onset of the authoritarian regime of [[Augusto B.

The [[Great Depression]] caused the downfall of Legu\u00eda, renewed political turmoil, and the emergence of the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance]] (APRA).<ref>Klar\u00e9n, Peter (2000).

A final peace treaty in 1929, signed between Peru and Chile called the [[Treaty of Lima]], returned [[Tacna]] to Peru. Between 1932 and 1933, Peru was engulfed in a [[Leticia Incident|year-long war with Colombia]] over a territorial dispute involving the [[Amazonas department]] and its capital [[Leticia, Amazonas|Leticia]].\n\nLater, in 1941, Peru and [[Ecuador]] fought the [[Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian War]], after which the [[Rio Protocol]] sought to formalize the boundary between those two countries. In a military coup on 29 October 1948, Gen. [[Manuel A. Odr\u00eda]] became president. Odr\u00eda's presidency was known as the ''Ochenio''. Momentarily pleasing the oligarchy and all others on the right, but followed a [[Populism|populist]] course that won him great favor with the poor and lower classes. A thriving economy allowed him to indulge in expensive but crowd-pleasing social policies. At the same time, however, [[civil rights]] were severely restricted and [[political corruption|corruption]] was rampant throughout his r\u00e9gime. Odr\u00eda was succeeded by [[Manuel Prado Ugarteche]]. However, widespread allegations of fraud prompted the Peruvian military to depose Prado and install a military junta, led by [[Ricardo P\u00e9rez Godoy]]. Godoy ran a short transitional government and held new elections in 1963, which were won by [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]] who assumed presidency until 1968. Bela\u00fande was recognized for his commitment to the [[democracy|democratic]] process. In 1968, the Armed Forces, led by General [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]], staged a coup against Bela\u00fande. Alvarado's regime undertook radical reforms aimed at fostering development, but failed to gain widespread support. In 1975, General [[Francisco Morales-Berm\u00fadez]] forcefully replaced Velasco, paralyzed reforms, and oversaw the reestablishment of democracy.\n\n[[File:Zonas donde se ha registrado actividad de Sendero Luminoso.png|thumb|left|Areas where the [[Shining Path]] was active in Peru]]\n\nPeru engaged in a brief successful conflict with Ecuador in the [[Paquisha War]] as a result of territorial dispute between the two countries. After the country experienced [[chronic inflation]], the Peruvian currency, the [[Peruvian sol (1863\u20131985)|sol]], was replaced by the ''[[Inti (currency)|Inti]]'' in mid-1985, which itself was replaced by the [[Peruvian nuevo sol|nuevo sol]] in July 1991, at which time the new sol had a cumulative value of one billion old soles. The per capita annual income of Peruvians fell to $720 (below the level of 1960) and Peru's [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] dropped 20% at which national reserves were a negative $900 million. The economic turbulence of the time acerbated social tensions in Peru and partly contributed to the rise of violent rebel rural insurgent movements, like [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]] (Shining Path) and [[T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement|MRTA]], which caused [[Internal conflict in Peru|great havoc]] throughout the country. Concerned about the economy, the increasing terrorist threat from Sendero Luminoso and MRTA, and allegations of official corruption, [[Alberto Fujimori]] assumed presidency in 1990. Fujimori implemented drastic measures that caused inflation to drop from 7,650% in 1990 to 139% in 1991.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nFaced with opposition to his reform efforts, Fujimori dissolved Congress in the ''[[auto-golpe]]'' (\"self-coup\") of 5 April 1992. He then revised the constitution; called new congressional elections; and implemented substantial economic reform, including privatization of numerous state-owned companies, creation of an investment-friendly climate, and sound management of the economy. Fujimori's administration was dogged by insurgent groups, most notably the [[Shining Path|Sendero Luminoso]], who carried out terrorist campaigns across the country throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Fujimori cracked down on the insurgents and was successful in largely quelling them by the late 1990s, but the fight was marred by atrocities committed by both the Peruvian security forces and the insurgents: the [[Barrios Altos massacre]] and [[La Cantuta massacre]] by Government paramilitary groups, and the bombings of [[Tarata bombing|Tarata]] and [[Frecuencia Latina bombing|Frecuencia Latina]] by Sendero Luminoso. Those incidents subsequently came to symbolize the [[Human rights in Peru|human rights]] violations committed in the last years of violence.{{fact|date=February 2019}}\n\nDuring early 1995, once again Peru and Ecuador clashed in the  [[Cenepa War]],  but in 1998 the governments of both nations signed a peace treaty that clearly demarcated the international boundary between them.

[[Peruvian arts|Peruvian artistic traditions]] date back to the elaborate pottery, textiles, jewelry, and sculpture of [[Pre-Inca cultures]]. The Incas maintained these crafts and made [[Architecture of Peru|architectural]] achievements including the construction of [[Machu Picchu]]. [[Baroque]] dominated colonial art, though modified by native traditions.<ref>Bailey, pp. 72\u201374.</ref>\n\nDuring this period, most art focused on religious subjects; the numerous churches of the era and the paintings of the [[Cusco School]] are representative.<ref>Bailey, p. 263.</ref> Arts stagnated after independence until the emergence of ''[[Indigenismo]]'' in the early 20th century.<ref name=Lucie/> Since the 1950s, Peruvian art has been [[Eclecticism in art|eclectic]] and shaped by both foreign and local art currents.\n\n=== Pre-Columbian art ===\nPeruvian art has its origin in the [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|Andean civilizations]]. These [[Peruvian Ancient Cultures|civilizations]] rose in the territory of modern Peru before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|arrival of the Spanish]]. Peru's earliest artwork came from the [[Cupisnique]] culture, which was concentrated on the Pacific coast, and the Chav\u00edn culture, which was largely north of [[Lima]] between the Andean mountain ranges of the Cordillera Negra and the Cordillera Blanca. Decorative work from this era, approximately the 9th century BCE, was symbolic and religious in nature. The artists worked with gold, silver and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]] to create a variety of sculpture and relief carvings. These civilizations were also known for their [[architecture]] and wood sculpture.\n\n=== Colonial art ===\nPeruvian [[sculpture]] and [[painting]] began to define themselves from the [[Studio|ateliers]] founded by [[Monk|monks]], who were strongly influenced by the Sevillian Baroque School. In this context, the stalls of the [[Lima Cathedral|Cathedral]] choir, the fountain of the Main Square of [[Lima District|Lima]] both by [[Pedro de Noguera]], and a great part of the colonial production were registered. The first center of art established by the Spanish was the [[Cuzco School]] that taught [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] artists European painting styles. [[Diego Quispe Tito]] (1611-1681) was one of the first members of the Cuzco school and [[Marcos Zapata]] (1710-1773) was one of the last.<ref name=\"Bayon\" />\n\nPainting of this time reflected a synthesis of European and indigenous influences, as is evident in the portrait of prisoner Atahualpa, by D. de Mora or in the canvases of the Italians [[Mateo P\u00e9rez de Alesio]] and Angelino Medoro, the Spaniards Francisco Bejarano and J. de Illescas and the Creole J. Rodriguez.\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th centuries, the [[Baroque]] Style also dominated the field of [[Plastic arts|plastic arts]].\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe term [[Peruvian literature]] not only refers to literature produced in the independent Republic of Peru, but also to literature produced in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] during the country's colonial period, and to [[Oral tradition|oral]] artistic forms created by diverse ethnic groups that existed in the area during the [[Prehispanic#South%20America|prehispanic period]], such as the [[Quechua people|Quechua]], the [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and the [[Chanka]] South American native groups.\n\nPeruvian literature is rooted in the oral traditions of [[pre-Columbian]] civilizations. Spaniards introduced writing in the 16th century; colonial literary expression included [[chronicle]]s and [[Christian literature|religious literature]]. After independence, [[Costumbrism]] and [[Romanticism]] became the most common literary genres, as exemplified in the works of [[Ricardo Palma]].<ref>Martin, \"Literature, music and the visual arts, c. 1820\u20131870\", pp. 37\u201339.</ref> The early 20th century's ''Indigenismo'' movement was led by such writers as [[Ciro Alegr\u00eda]]<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 151\u2013152.</ref> and [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arguedas]].<ref>Martin, \"Narrative since c. 1920\", pp. 178\u2013179.</ref> [[C\u00e9sar Vallejo]] wrote modernist and often politically engaged verse.

Modern indigenous Peruvian food mainly consists of corn, potatoes, and chilies. There are now more than 3,000 kinds of potatoes grown on Peruvian terrain, according to Peru's Instituto Peruano de la Papa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://guide.michelin.com/sg/features/7-things-you-need-to-know-about-peruvian-cuisine/news|title=7 Things You Need to Know about Peruvian Cuisine|website=MICHELIN Guide}}</ref>\nModern [[Peruvian cuisine]] blends [[Native American cuisine#Native American cuisine of South America|Amerindian]] and [[Spanish food]] with strong influences from Chinese, African, Arab, Italian, and Japanese cooking.<ref>Custer, pp. 17\u201322.</ref> Common dishes include ''[[anticuchos]]'', ''[[ceviche]]'', and ''[[pachamanca]]''.

Without the familiar ingredients from their home countries, immigrants modified their traditional cuisines by using ingredients available in Peru. The four traditional staples of Peruvian cuisine are [[Maize|corn]], [[potato]]es and other [[tuber]]s, [[Amaranthaceae]]s ([[quinoa]], [[ka\u00f1iwa]] and [[kiwicha]]) and [[legume]]s ([[beans]] and [[lupins]]). Staples brought by the Spanish include [[rice]], [[wheat]] and meats (beef, pork and chicken). Many traditional foods\u2014such as [[quinoa]], [[kiwicha]], [[chili pepper]]s, and several roots and [[tuber]]s have increased in popularity in recent decades, reflecting a revival of interest in native Peruvian foods and culinary techniques. Chef [[Gaston Acurio]] has become well known for raising awareness of local ingredients.\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Marinera_Norte\u00f1a.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Marinera_Norte%C3%B1a.jpg|thumb|[[Marinera]] Norte\u00f1a]]\n[[Peruvian music]] has Andean, Spanish, and African roots.<ref>Romero, Ra\u00fal (1999). \"Andean Peru\". In: John Schechter (ed.), ''Music in Latin American culture: regional tradition''. New York: Schirmer Books, pp.&nbsp;385\u2013386.</ref> In pre-Hispanic times, musical expressions varied widely in each region; the ''[[quena]]'' and the ''[[tinya]]'' were two common instruments.<ref name=\"Olsen\" /> Spaniards introduced new instruments, such as the guitar and the harp, which led to the development of crossbred instruments like the ''[[charango]]''.<ref name=\"Turino\" /> African contributions to Peruvian music include its rhythms and the ''[[Cajon|caj\u00f3n]]'', a percussion instrument. [[Peruvian folk dances]] include [[marinera]], [[tondero]], [[zamacueca]], [[diablada]] and [[huayno]].<ref>Romero, Ra\u00fal (1985). \"La m\u00fasica tradicional y popular\". In: Patronato Popular y Porvenir, ''La m\u00fasica en el Per\u00fa''. Lima: Industrial Gr\u00e1fica, pp.&nbsp;pp. 243\u2013245, 261\u2013265.</ref>\n\nPeruvian music is dominated by the national [[Musical instrument|instrument]], the [[charango]]. The charango is member of the [[lute]] family of instruments and was invented during the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]] by musicians imitating the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[vihuela]]. In the Canas and [[Titicaca]] regions, the charango is used in courtship rituals, symbolically invoking [[Mermaid|mermaids]] with the instrument to lure the woman to the male performers. Until the 1960s, the charango was denigrated as an instrument of the rural poor. After the revolution in 1959, which built upon the [[Indigenismo]] movement (1910\u20131940), the charango was popularized among other performers. Variants include the [[walaycho]], [[chillador]], [[chinlili]], and the larger and lower-tuned [[charangon]].\n\nWhile the Spanish [[guitar]] is widely played, so too is the Spanish-in-origin [[bandurria]]. Unlike the guitar, it has been transformed by Peruvian players over the years, changing from a 12-string, 6-course instrument to one having 12 to 16 strings in a mere 4 courses. [[Violins]] and [[harps]], also of European origin, are also played.\n\n=== Cinema ===\nWhile the Peruvian film industry has not been nearly as prolific as that of some other Latin American countries, some Peruvian movies produced enjoyed regional success. Historically, the cinema of Peru [[Cinema of Iquitos|began in Iquitos]] in 1932 by Antonio Wong Rengifo (with a momentous, initial [[Movie theater|film billboard]] from 1900) because the [[Rubber boom|rubber boom]] and the intense arrival of foreigners with technology to the city, and thus continued an extensive, unique filmography, with a different style than the films made in the capital, Lima.\n\nPeru also produced the first animated 3-D film in [[Latin America]], ''[[Piratas en el Callao]]''. This film is set in the historical port city of [[Callao]], which during colonial times had to defend itself against attacks by Dutch and British privateers seeking to undercut Spain's trade with its colonies. The film was produced by the [[Peruvians|Peruvian]] company Alpamayo Entertainment, which made a second 3-D film one year later: ''Dragones: Destino de Fuego''.\n\nIn February 2006, the film ''[[Madeinusa]]'', produced as a joint venture between Peru and Spain and directed by [[Claudia Llosa]], was set in an imaginary Andean village and describes the stagnating life of Madeinusa performed by [[Magaly Solier]] and the traumas of post-civil war Peru.\n\nLlosa, who shared elements of [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s [[Magic realism|magic realism]], won an award at the [[Rotterdam Film Festival]]. Llosa's second feature, [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), was nominated for the [[82nd Academy Awards]] for Best Foreign Language Picture, the first Peruvian film in the Academy's history to be nominated. [[The Milk of Sorrow]] (\"La Teta Asustada\"), won the Golden Bear award at the 2009 Berlinale.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Peru}}\n*[[Outline of Peru]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{notelist}}\n{{reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=Altroy>D'Altroy, Terence (2002).

[[Athens]] is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by [[Thessaloniki]].\n\nGreece is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Situated on the southern tip of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], it shares land borders with [[Albania]] to the northwest, [[North Macedonia]] and [[Bulgaria]] to the north, and [[Turkey]] to the northeast. The [[Aegean Sea]] lies to the east of the [[Geography of Greece|mainland]], the [[Ionian Sea]] to the west, the [[Sea of Crete|Cretan Sea]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and the [[list of countries by length of coastline|11th longest coastline in the world]] at {{convert|13676|km|0|abbr=on}} in length, featuring a large number of [[List of islands of Greece|islands]], of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with [[Mount Olympus]] being the highest peak at {{convert|2918|m|ft}}. The country consists of nine [[geographic regions of Greece|geographic regions]]: [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Central Greece]], the [[Peloponnese]], [[Thessaly]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], the [[Aegean Islands]] (including the [[Dodecanese]] and [[Cyclades]]), [[western Thrace|Thrace]], [[Crete]], and the [[Ionian Islands]].\n\nGreece is considered the cradle of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]], being the birthplace of [[Athenian democracy|democracy]], [[Western philosophy]], [[Western literature]], [[historiography]], [[political science]], major [[History of science in classical antiquity|scientific]] and [[Greek mathematics|mathematical]] principles, [[Drama|Western drama]] and notably the [[Olympic Games]]. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as ''poleis'' (singular ''[[polis]]''), which spanned the entire [[Mediterranean region]] and the [[Black Sea]]. [[Philip of Macedon]] united most of the Greek mainland in the fourth century BC, with his son [[Alexander the Great]] [[Macedonian Empire|rapidly conquering much of the ancient world]], from the eastern Mediterranean to [[India]]. Greece was [[Roman Greece|annexed]] by [[Roman Republic|Rome]] in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor, the [[Byzantine Empire]], in which Greek language and culture were dominant. Rooted in the first century A.D., the  [[Greek Orthodox Church]] helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox World]]. Falling under [[Ottoman Greece|Ottoman dominion]] in the mid-15th century, the modern [[nation state]] of Greece emerged in 1830 following a [[Greek War of Independence|war of independence]]. Greece's rich historical legacy is reflected by its 18 [[List of World Heritage Sites in Greece|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]].\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Greece is a [[unitary parliamentary republic]] and [[developed country]] with an advanced [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economy]], a high [[quality of life]], and a very high [[Human Development Index|standard of living]]. A founding member of the [[United Nations]], Greece was the tenth member to join the [[European Communities]] (precursor to the [[European Union]]) and has been part of the [[Eurozone]] since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the [[Council of Europe]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE), and the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] (OIF).

Greece also accepted the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country's debtors. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called [[Modern Greek|Demotic]]. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of [[Ancient Greek]].\n\nGovernment documents and newspapers were consequently published in ''[[Katharevousa]]'' (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the [[New Testament]] was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the ''Evangeliaka''). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.\n\nAll Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the [[regions of ancient Greece|Hellenic lands]] under Ottoman rule. Especially in [[Crete]], a [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|prolonged revolt in 1866\u20131869]] had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russia and the Ottomans in 1877]], Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor, and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, [[Thessaly]] and small parts of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] were ceded to Greece as part of the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]], while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.\n\nGreeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish War of 1897]], the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an [[Cretan State|autonomous state]] under [[Prince George of Greece]].

In the [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September 2015 general election]], Tsipras led Syriza to another victory, winning 145 out of 300 seats and re-forming the coalition with the Independent Greeks.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Greece}}\n[[File:Foreign relations of Greece.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.55|Representation through:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/el-GR/Services/Directory/GreekAuthoritiesAbroad/#\u0392 |title=\u0391\u03c1\u03c7\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u0395\u03be\u03c9\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd (Missions Abroad) |publisher=Hellenic Republic Ministry of Foreign Affairs |language=Greek |accessdate=2 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521050219/http://www.mfa.gr/www.mfa.gr/el-GR/Services/Directory/GreekAuthoritiesAbroad/ |archivedate=21 May 2011 }}</ref> {{Color box|#3771c8|border=darkgray}} embassy&nbsp;\u2013 {{Color box|#aaccff|border=darkgray}} embassy in another country<br />{{Color box|#37c837|border=darkgray}} general consulate&nbsp;\u2013 {{Color box|#ffaaaa|border=darkgray}} liaison office&nbsp;\u2013 {{Color box|#cccccc|border=darkgray}} no representation&nbsp;\u2013 {{Color box|black|border=darkgray}} Greece]]\n\nGreece's foreign policy is conducted through the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] and its head, the [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Minister for Foreign Affairs]].

Greek was a widely spoken [[lingua franca]] in the Mediterranean world and beyond during [[Classical Antiquity]], and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the [[Greek language question]], on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic [[Katharevousa]], created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the [[Dimotiki]], the form of the [[Greek language]] which evolved naturally from [[Byzantine Greek language|Byzantine Greek]] and was the language of the people. The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and Katharevousa fell to disuse.\n\nGreece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive [[Pontic Greek|Pontic]] dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the [[Greek genocide]] and constitute a sizable group. The [[Cappadocian Greek|Cappadocian]] dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and is barely spoken now. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the [[Sarakatsani]], traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of [[Greek Macedonia]] and other parts of [[Northern Greece]]. The [[Tsakonian language]], a distinct Greek language deriving from [[Doric Greek]] instead of [[Koine Greek]], is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.\n\nThe [[Muslim minority of Greece|Muslim minority]] in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ([[Pomaks]]){{Sfn | Trudgill | 2000}} and [[Romani language|Romani]]. Romani is also spoken by Christian [[Romani people|Roma]] in other parts of the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.\n\nToday they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction. This goes for the [[Arvanites]], an [[Albanian language|Albanian]]-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the [[Aromanians]] and [[Megleno-Romanians|Moglenites]], also known as [[Vlachs]], whose language is closely related to [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece. Members of these groups ethnically identify as Greeks<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.cilevics.eu/minelres/reports/greece/greece_NGO.htm | publisher = Greek Helsinki Monitor | title = Minority Rights Group, Greece, Report about Compliance with the Principles of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities (along guidelines for state reports according to Article 25.1 of the Convention) | date = 8 September 1999}}</ref> and are today all at least bilingual in Greek.\n\nNear the northern Greek borders there are also some [[Slavic speakers of Greek Macedonia|Slavic\u2013speaking groups]], locally known as ''Slavomacedonian''-speaking, most of whose members identify ethnically as Greeks.

There are also State Non-University Tertiary Institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration (2 to 3 years) which operate under the authority of other Ministries. Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of ''Lykeio''. Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the [[Hellenic Open University]] through a form of lottery. The [[National and Capodistrian University of Athens|Capodistrian University of Athens]] is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe Greek education system also provides special kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning. There are also specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological, and physical education.\n\nSeventy-two percent of Greek adults aged 25\u201364 have completed upper secondary education, which is slightly less than the OECD average of 74 percent. The average Greek pupil scored 458 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD's 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This score is lower than the OECD average of 486.

Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] or [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as [[panel painting]]s. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[Bronze Age]], with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like [[Knossos]], [[Tiryns]] and [[Mycenae]]. Much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as [[polychrome]].\n\n[[Ancient Greek sculpture]] was composed almost entirely of [[marble]] or [[bronze]]; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable. [[Chryselephantine]] sculptures, used for temple [[cult image]]s and luxury works, used [[gold]], most often in [[gold leaf|leaf form]] and [[ivory]] for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived. By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist [[Vinzenz Brinkmann]] in the late 20th century, that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact.<ref name=Gurewitsch>{{cite journal|last=Gurewitsch |first= Matthew |date=July 2008 |title= True Colors |journal= Smithsonian |pages= 66\u201371 |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/true-colors.html}}</ref>\n\nThe art production continued also during the Byzantine era. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its \u201cabstract,\u201d or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on [[icon]]s and [[hagiography|hagiographies]]. The [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)]] was the artistic expression of [[Macedonian Renaissance]], a label sometimes used to describe the period of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire (867\u20131056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into [[Christian art]]work.\n\nPost Byzantine art schools include the [[Cretan School]] and [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School]]. The first artistic movement in the [[Greek Kingdom]] can be considered the [[Greek academic art of the 19th century]] (''Munich School''). Notable modern Greek painters include [[Nikolaos Gyzis]], [[Georgios Jakobides]], [[Theodoros Vryzakis]], [[Nikiforos Lytras]], [[Konstantinos Volanakis]], [[Nikos Engonopoulos]] and [[Yannis Tsarouchis]], while some notable sculptors are [[Pavlos Prosalentis]], [[Ioannis Kossos]], [[Leonidas Drosis]], [[Georgios Bonanos]] and [[Yannoulis Chalepas]].\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{See also|Ancient Greek architecture|Byzantine architecture|Modern Greek architecture}}\n[[File:Vathia Mani Greece.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Towerhouses of [[Mani peninsula]]]]\n\nThe architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks (''Hellenes''), whose [[Ancient Greece|culture]] flourished on the Greek mainland, the [[Aegean Islands]] and their [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]], for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the [[Doric Order]], the [[Ionic Order]] and the [[Corinthian Order]], was to have profound effect on [[History of architecture|Western architecture]] of later periods.\n\nByzantine architecture is the [[architecture]] promoted by the [[Byzantine Empire]], also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, which dominated Greece and the Greek speaking world during the Middle Ages. The empire endured for more than a [[millennium]], dramatically influencing [[Medieval architecture]] throughout Europe and the Near East, and becoming the primary progenitor of the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman architectural]] traditions that followed its collapse.\n\nAfter the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Independence]], the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. [[Patras]] was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, [[Stamatis Voulgaris]], a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor [[Ioannis Kapodistrias|Kapodistrias]], who approved it. Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras.<ref>\u03a0\u03b1\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u039a\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03b6\u03ae\u03c2, \u00ab\u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0392\u03bf\u03cd\u03bb\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1\u03b7\u03c2. \u039f \u03b1\u03b3\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2, \u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf \u03ac\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03c9\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2\u00bb, \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf: \u03a3\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc, \u03a0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9 \u0388\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03cc\u03b4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03b8\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, \u03b5\u03ba\u03b4. \u03a4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc \u0395\u03c0\u03b9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1, 1976, \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb.158</ref>\n\nTwo special genres can be considered the [[Cycladic architecture]], featuring white-coloured houses, in the [[Cyclades]] and the [[Epirotic architecture]] in the region of [[Epirus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://travelaway.me/cycladic-architecture/|title=23 Best Examples of Cycladic Architecture|date=23 April 2015|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.greeka.com/epirus/architecture.htm|title=Architecture of Epirus, Greece - Greeka.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the establishment of the [[Greek Kingdom]], the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the [[Neoclassical architecture]].

The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.\n\n[[Byzantine literature]] refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in [[Attic Greek|Atticizing]], [[Medieval]] and early [[Modern Greek]], and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the Christian [[Middle Ages]]. Although ''popular'' Byzantine literature and early [[Modern Greek literature]] both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.<ref>\"The Modern Greek language in its relation to Ancient Greek\", [[E.

The Cretan Renaissance poem ''[[Erotokritos]]'' is undoubtedly the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature. It is a verse [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] written around 1600 by [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]] (1553\u20131613). Later, during the period of Greek enlightenment ([[Diafotismos]]), writers such as [[Adamantios Korais]] and [[Rigas Feraios]] prepared with their works the [[Greek War of Independence|Greek Revolution]] (1821\u20131830).\n\nLeading figures of modern Greek literature include [[Dionysios Solomos]], [[Andreas Kalvos]], [[Angelos Sikelianos]], [[Emmanuel Rhoides]], [[Demetrius Vikelas]], [[Kostis Palamas]], [[Penelope Delta]], [[Yannis Ritsos]], [[Alexandros Papadiamantis]], [[Nikos Kazantzakis]], [[Andreas Embeirikos]], [[Kostas Karyotakis]], [[Gregorios Xenopoulos]], [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], [[Nikos Kavvadias]], [[Kostas Varnalis]] and [[Kiki Dimoula]]. Two Greek authors have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[George Seferis]] in 1963 and [[Odysseas Elytis]] in 1979.\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy|Modern Greek Enlightenment}}\n[[File:\u03a0\u03bb\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2, \u0391\u03ba\u03b1\u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd 6619.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Statue of [[Plato]] in Athens.]]\n\nMost western philosophical traditions began in [[Ancient Greece]] in the 6th century BC. The first philosophers are called \"Presocratics,\" which designates that they came before [[Socrates]], whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.\n\nA new period of philosophy started with Socrates. Like the [[Sophists]], he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from [[Plato]], who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.\n\n[[Aristotle]] of [[Stagira]], the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of [[Greek philosophy]] from other founders during ancient times were [[Stoicism]], [[Epicureanism]], [[Skepticism]] and [[Neoplatonism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/greekphi/|title=Ancient Greek Philosophy |publisher= Internet encyclopedia of philosophy|accessdate= 23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n[[Byzantine philosophy]] refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the [[Byzantine Empire]], especially between the 8th and 15th centuries. It was characterised by a [[Christianity|Christian]] world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and the [[Neoplatonists]].\n\nOn the eve of the [[Fall of Constantinople]], [[Gemistus Pletho]] tried to restore the use of the term \"Hellene\" and advocated the return to the [[Olympian Gods]] of the ancient world. After 1453 a number of [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|Greek Byzantine scholars]] who fled to western Europe contributed to the [[Renaissance]].\n\nIn modern period, [[Modern Greek Enlightenment|Diafotismos]] (Greek: \u0394\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2, \"enlightenment\", \"illumination\") was the Greek expression of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and its philosophical and political ideas. Some notable representatives were [[Adamantios Korais]], [[Rigas Feraios]] and [[Theophilos Kairis]].\n\nOther modern era Greek philosophers or political scientists include [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Nicos Poulantzas]] and [[Christos Yannaras]].\n\n=== Music and dances ===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Music of Greece}}\n[[File:Sfakia-dance.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cretan]] dancers of [[Greek folk music|traditional folk music]]]]\n[[File:Rembetes Karaiskaki 1933.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rebetiko|Rebetes]] in Karaiskaki, [[Piraeus]] (1933). Left [[Markos Vamvakaris]] with [[bouzouki]].]]\n\nGreek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed [[aulos]] and the plucked string instrument, the [[lyre]], especially the special kind called a [[kithara]]. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the [[Roman Empire]], Middle East, and the [[Byzantine Empire]] also had effect on Greek music.\n\nWhile the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] resisted any type of change. Therefore, [[Byzantine music]] remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic [[Byzantine chant]]; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.\n\nAlong with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the [[Greek folk music|Greek folk song]] (''Demotiko'') which is divided into two cycles, the [[Acritic songs|akritic]] and [[klephtic song|klephtic]]. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the [[akrites]] (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with [[Digenis Acritas|Digenes Akritas]]. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the [[Greek War of Independence]]. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, ''paraloghes'' (narrative song or ballad), love songs, [[mantinada|mantinades]], wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people's struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.\n\n[[File:Mikis2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|[[Mikis Theodorakis]] is one of the most popular and significant Greek songwriters]]\n\nThe [[Heptanese]]an [[Greek folk music#Ionian Islands|kant\u00e1dhes]] (\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03c2 '[[serenade]]s'; sing.: \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b4\u03b1) became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870\u20131930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage (\u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b8\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ac \u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 'theatrical revue songs') in [[revue]], [[operetta]]s and [[nocturne]]s that were dominating Athens' theater scene.\n\n[[Rebetiko]], initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later [[la\u00efk\u00f3]] (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]], [[Grigoris Bithikotsis]], [[Stelios Kazantzidis]], [[George Dalaras]], [[Haris Alexiou]] and [[Glykeria]].\n\nRegarding the classical music, it was through the [[Ionian islands]] (which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek: ''\u0395\u03c0\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae \u03a3\u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae''), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]], [[Spyridon Xyndas]], [[Spyridon Samaras]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]. [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.\n\nIn the 20th century, Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of [[avant garde]] and modern [[classical music]], with figures such as [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], and [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] achieving international prominence. At the same time, composers and musicians such as [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Manos Hatzidakis]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]], [[Vangelis]] and [[Demis Roussos]] garnered an international following for their music, which include famous [[film score]]s such as [[Zorba the Greek]], [[Serpico]], [[Never on Sunday]], [[America America]], [[Eternity and a Day]], [[Chariots of Fire]], [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|Blade Runner]], among others. [[Greek American]] composers known for their film scores include also [[Yanni]] and [[Basil Poledouris]]. Notable Greek [[opera]] singers and [[classical music]]ians of the 20th and 21st century include [[Maria Callas]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Mario Frangoulis]], [[Leonidas Kavakos]], [[Dimitris Sgouros]] and others.\n\nDuring the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|dictatorship of the Colonels]], the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed, internally exiled, and put in a [[concentration camp]],<ref name=\"Hischak2015\">{{cite book|author=Thomas S.

In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]], Greece won with the song \"[[My Number One]]\", performed by Greek-Swedish singer [[Elena Paparizou]]. The song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Albania, Cyprus, Serbia & Montenegro, Sweden and Germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in Greece.

Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like [[skordalia]] (a thick pur\u00e9e of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), [[lentil]] [[soup]], [[retsina]] (white or ros\u00e9 wine sealed with pine resin) and [[Sesame seed candy|pasteli]] (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as [[meze]] with various dips such as [[tzatziki]], grilled octopus and small fish, [[feta cheese]], [[dolmades]] (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various [[pulses]], [[olive]]s and cheese. [[Olive oil]] is added to almost every dish.\n\nSome sweet desserts include [[melomakarona]], [[diples]] and [[galaktoboureko]], and drinks such as [[ouzo]], [[metaxa]] and a variety of wines including retsina. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines: [[oregano]], [[Mentha|mint]], garlic, [[onion]], [[dill]] and [[bay laurel]] leaves. Other common herbs and spices include [[basil]], [[thyme]] and [[fennel]] seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use \"sweet\" spices in combination with meat, for example [[cinnamon]] and [[clove]]s in stews.\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Greek cinema}}\nCinema first appeared in Greece in 1896, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907 in Athens. In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films began. ''Golfo'' (\u0393\u03ba\u03cc\u03bb\u03c6\u03c9), a well known traditional love story, is considered the first Greek [[feature film]], although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''\u0394\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a7\u03bb\u03cc\u03b7''), containing one of the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1944 [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.\n\n[[File:Theodoros Angelopoulos Athens 26-4-2009-2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.65|[[Theodoros Angelopoulos]], winner of the [[Palme d'Or]] in [[1998 Cannes Film Festival|1998]], notable director in the history of the [[European cinema]]]]\n\nThe 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many to be a \"golden age\" of Greek cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognised as important figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[George Tzavellas]], [[Irene Papas]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]] and others. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements. Some notable films include ''[[The Drunkard (1950 film)|The Drunkard]]'' (1950, directed by [[George Tzavellas]]), ''[[The Counterfeit Coin]]'' (1955, by [[Giorgos Tzavellas]]), ''\u03a0\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc \u03a8\u03c9\u03bc\u03af'' (1951, by [[Grigoris Grigoriou]]), ''[[O Drakos]]'' (1956, by [[Nikos Koundouros]]), ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955, directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis), ''[[Woe to the Young]]'' (1961, by [[Alekos Sakellarios]]), ''[[Glory Sky]]'' (1962, by [[Takis Kanellopoulos]]) and ''[[The Red Lanterns]]'' (1963, by [[Vasilis Georgiadis]])\n\nCacoyannis also directed ''[[Zorba the Greek]]'' with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. [[Finos Film]] also contributed in this period with movies such as ''\u039b\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b1, \u03a6\u03c4\u03ce\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03cc\u03c4\u03b9\u03bc\u03bf'', ''[[Madalena (film)|Madalena]]'', ''[[I theia ap' to Chicago]]'', ''\u03a4\u03bf \u03be\u03cd\u03bb\u03bf \u03b2\u03b3\u03ae\u03ba\u03b5 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03bf'' and many more.\n\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThere are also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora, such as the Greek-French [[Costa-Gavras]] and the Greek-Americans [[Elia Kazan]], [[John Cassavetes]] and [[Alexander Payne]].\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{Main|Sports in Greece}}\n[[File:Louis entering Kallimarmaron at the 1896 Athens Olympics.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Spyridon Louis]] entering the [[Panathenaic Stadium]] at the end of the marathon; [[1896 Summer Olympics]].]]\n[[File:Charisteas' Siegtreffer im Finale der Euro 2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Angelos Charisteas]] scoring Greece's winning goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final]]]]\n\nGreece is the birthplace of the [[ancient Olympic Games]], first recorded in 776 BC in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], and hosted the modern [[Olympic Games]] twice, the inaugural [[1896 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2004 Summer Olympics]].

In women's European competitions, Greek water polo teams ([[NC Vouliagmeni]], [[ANO Glyfada|Glyfada NSC]], [[Olympiacos Women's Water Polo Team|Olympiacos]], [[Ethnikos Piraeus Water Polo Club|Ethnikos Piraeus]]) are amongst the most successful in European water pol\u03bf, having won 4 [[LEN Women's Champions' Cup|LEN Champions Cups]], 3 [[Women's LEN Trophy|LEN Trophies]] and 2 European Supercups.\n\nThe [[Greece men's national volleyball team|Greek men's national volleyball team]] has won two bronze medals, one in the [[Men's European Volleyball Championship|European Volleyball Championship]] and another one in the [[Men's European Volleyball League]], a 5th place in the [[Volleyball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and a 6th place in the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship]]. The Greek league, the [[A1 Ethniki Volleyball|A1 Ethniki]], is considered one of the top volleyball leagues in Europe and the Greek clubs have had significant success in European competitions. [[Olympiacos S.C.|Olympiacos]] is the most successful volleyball club in the country having won the most domestic titles and being the only Greek club to have won European titles; they have won two [[CEV Top Teams Cup|CEV Cups]], they have been [[CEV Champions League]] runners-up twice and they have played in 12 Final Fours in the European competitions, making them one of the most traditional volleyball clubs in Europe. [[Iraklis Thessaloniki V.C.|Iraklis]] have also seen significant success in European competitions, having been three times runners-up of the [[CEV Champions League]].\n\nIn handball, [[AC Diomidis Argous]] is the only Greek club to have won a [[EHF Challenge Cup|European Cup]].\n\nApart from these, [[cricket]] is relatively popular in [[Corfu]].\n\n=== Mythology ===\n{{Main|Greek mythology}}\nThe numerous gods of the [[ancient Greek religion]] as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek [[epic (genre)|epics]] (''[[The Odyssey]]'' and ''[[The Iliad]]'') and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology. Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the [[ancient Greeks|ancient Greek]] world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.\n\nThe principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the [[Dodekatheon]], or the ''Twelve Gods'', who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was [[Zeus]], the king of the gods, who was married to [[Hera]], who was also Zeus's sister. The other Greek gods that made up the [[Twelve Olympians]] were [[Ares]], [[Poseidon]], [[Athena]], [[Demeter]], [[Dionysus]], [[Apollo]], [[Artemis]], [[Aphrodite]], [[Hephaestus]] and [[Hermes]]. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as [[nymphs]] and other magical creatures.\n\n=== Public holidays and festivals ===\n{{Main|Public holidays in Greece}}\n[[File:Virgin Mary procession, Chora of Naxos, 118916.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Procession in honor of the Assumption of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] (15 August)]]\n\nAccording to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. Since the late '70s, Saturday also is a non school and not working day. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (''[[Greek Independence Day]]''), [[Easter Monday]], 15 August (''[[Dormition of the Mother of God|Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin]]''), and 25 December (''[[Christmas]]''). 1 May (''[[Labour Day]]'') and 28 October (''[[Ohi Day]]'') are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.\n\nIn addition to the national holidays, there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a \"Patron Saint\" parallel to \"[[Name days in Greece|Name Days]]\", or a \"Liberation Day\". On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off.\n\nNotable festivals, beyond the religious fests, include [[Patras Carnival]], [[Athens Festival]] and various local wine festivals. The city of [[Thessaloniki]] is also home of a number of festivals and events. The [[International Thessaloniki Film Festival|Thessaloniki International Film Festival]] is one of the most important film festivals in [[Southern Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586|script-title=el:\u0394\u03b9\u03b5\u03b8\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b2\u03ac\u03bb \u039a\u03b9\u03bd\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03bf\u03c5 \u0398\u03b5\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2 \u2013 \u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03af\u03bb|trans-title=Thessaloniki International Film Festival \u2013 Profile|language=el|accessdate=3 September 2015|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905090357/http://www.filmfestival.gr/default.aspx?lang=el-GR&loc=1&page=586|archive-date=5 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Greece|Ancient Greece}}\n* [[Outline of Greece]]\n** [[Outline of ancient Greece]]\n* [[Index of Greece-related articles]]{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=\"lower-alpha\"}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Main|Bibliography of Greece}}\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* \"Minorities in Greece&nbsp;\u2013 Historical Issues and New Perspectives\".

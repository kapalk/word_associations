The nation now has a tiered governmental system consisting of a [[federal government]] overseeing ethnically based regional states, zones, [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] (''woreda''), and ''[[kebele]]s'' (\"neighbourhoods\").\n\nSince 1996, Ethiopia has been divided into nine ethnically-based and politically autonomous [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional states]] (''kililoch'', singular ''kilil''&thinsp;) and two chartered cities (''astedader akababiwoch'', singular ''astedader akababi''&thinsp;), the latter being [[Addis Ababa]] and [[Dire Dawa]]. The ''kililoch'' are subdivided into sixty-eight [[Zones of Ethiopia|zones]], and then further into 550 ''woredas'' and several special ''woredas''.\n\nThe constitution assigns extensive power to regional states, which can establish their own government and democracy as long as it is in line with the federal government's constitution. Each region has at its apex a regional council where members are directly elected to represent the districts and the council has legislative and executive power to direct internal affairs of the regions.\n\nArticle 39 of the Ethiopian Constitution further gives every regional state the right to secede from Ethiopia. There is debate, however, as to how much of the power guaranteed in the constitution is actually given to the states. The councils implement their mandate through an executive committee and regional sectoral bureaus. Such elaborate structure of council, executive, and sectoral public institutions is replicated to the next level (''woreda'').\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"| Region or city (\u12ad\u120d\u120d/\u12e8\u12a8\u1270\u121b \u12a0\u1235\u1270\u12f3\u12f5\u122d)\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Capital\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Area {{smaller|{{nobold|(km<sup>2</sup>)}}}}\n! colspan=\"4\" | Population<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csa.gov.et/Central |title=Statistical Agency of Ethiopia, 2005\u20132013 |accessdate=2 May 2017 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n|-\n!

It lies between the [[3rd parallel north]] and the [[15th parallel north]] and longitudes [[33rd meridian east]] and [[48th meridian east]].\n\nThe major portion of Ethiopia lies on the [[Horn of Africa]], which is the easternmost part of the African landmass. Bordering Ethiopia are [[Sudan]] and [[South Sudan]] to the west, [[Djibouti]] and [[Eritrea]] to the north, [[Somalia]] to the east and [[Kenya]] to the south. Within Ethiopia is a vast highland complex of mountains and dissected plateaus divided by the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]], which runs generally southwest to northeast and is surrounded by lowlands, [[steppe]]s, or semi-desert. The great diversity of terrain determines wide variations in climate, soils, natural vegetation, and settlement patterns.\n\nEthiopia is an ecologically diverse country, ranging from the deserts along the eastern border to the tropical forests in the south to extensive [[Afromontane]] in the northern and southwestern parts. [[Lake Tana]] in the north is the source of the [[Blue Nile]]. It also has a large number of [[endemism|endemic]] species, notably the [[gelada]], the [[walia ibex]] and the [[Ethiopian wolf]] (\"Simien fox\"). The wide range of altitude has given the country a variety of ecologically distinct areas, and this has helped to encourage the evolution of endemic species in ecological isolation.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Geography of Ethiopia#Climate}}\n[[File:Semien Mountains 13.jpg|thumb|[[Semien Mountains]]]]\nThe predominant climate type is tropical monsoon, with wide topographic-induced variation. The [[Ethiopian Highlands]] cover most of the country and have a climate which is generally considerably cooler than other regions at similar proximity to the Equator. Most of the country's major cities are located at elevations of around {{convert|2000|\u2013|2500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, including historic capitals such as Gondar and Axum.\n[[File:Wonchi Lake of Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|left|Wonchi Lake]]\nThe modern capital, Addis Ababa, is situated on the foothills of [[Mount Entoto]] at an elevation of around {{convert|2400|m}}. It experiences a mild climate year round. With temperatures fairly uniform year round, the seasons in Addis Ababa are largely defined by rainfall: a dry season from October to February, a light rainy season from March to May, and a heavy rainy season from June to September. The average annual rainfall is approximately {{convert|1200|mm|}}.\n\nThere are on average 7 hours of sunshine per day. The dry season is the sunniest time of the year, though even at the height of the rainy season in July and August there are still usually several hours per day of bright sunshine. The average annual temperature in Addis Ababa is {{convert|16|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, with daily maximum temperatures averaging {{convert|20|-|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} throughout the year, and overnight lows averaging {{convert|5|-|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\nMost major cities and tourist sites in Ethiopia lie at a similar elevation to Addis Ababa and have a comparable climate. In less elevated regions, particularly the lower lying [[Ethiopian xeric grasslands and shrublands]] in the east of the country, the climate can be significantly hotter and drier. Dallol, in the [[Danakil Depression]] in this eastern zone, has the world's highest average annual temperature of {{convert|34|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}.\n\n== Environment ==\n{{see also|Environmental issues in Ethiopia}}\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{Main|Wildlife of Ethiopia}}\n[[File:Canis simensis -Simien Mountains, Ethiopia-8.jpg|thumb|The [[Ethiopian wolf]]]]\nEthiopia has 31 endemic species of mammals.<ref name=\"Massicot\"/> The [[African wild dog]] prehistorically had widespread distribution in the territory.

As people moved from rural areas to the cities, there were fewer people to grow food for the population. The Land Reform Act was meant to increase agriculture since food production was not keeping up with population growth over the period of 1970\u20131983. This program proliferated the formation of peasant associations, large villages based on agriculture. The act did lead to an increase in food production, although there is debate over the cause; it may be related to weather conditions more than the reform act.<ref name=\"Anderson, Frank 1991.

Children add the [[given name]]s of their father and paternal grandfather consecutively to their own given name. For compatibility purposes, as is done in passports, the grandfather's given name is taken as a family [[surname]], and a person's given name and their father's given name form the first name.\n\nEveryone is addressed by their given name. In official situations, the prefixes ''Ato'' ('''\u12a0\u1276''') is used for men; ''Weyzero'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122e''') for married women; and ''Weyzer\u012bt'' ('''\u12c8\u12ed\u12d8\u122a\u1275''') for unmarried women.\n\n===Calendar===\n{{Main|Ethiopian calendar|Oromo calendar}}\n[[File:Celebrate The Return of Axum Obelisk (Detail) (3172365788).jpg|thumb|Model commemorating the [[Obelisk of Axum|Obelisk of Aksum]]'s return to Ethiopia, which shows the date of its departure and return according to the [[Ethiopian calendar]]]]\nEthiopia has several local calendars. The most widely known is the [[Ethiopian calendar]], also known as the Ge'ez calendar. It is based on the older Alexandrian or [[Coptic calendar]], which in turn derives from the [[Egyptian calendar]]. Like the Coptic calendar, the Ethiopian calendar has twelve months of exactly 30 days each plus five or six [[epagomenal]] days, which comprise a thirteenth month. The Ethiopian months begin on the same days as those of the Coptic calendar, but their names are in Ge'ez.\n\nLike the [[Julian calendar]], the sixth epagomenal day\u2014which in essence is a [[leap day]]\u2014is added every four years without exception on 29 August of the Julian calendar, six months before the Julian leap day. Thus, the first day of the Ethiopian year, 1 M\u00e4sk\u00e4r\u00e4m, for years between 1901 and 2099 (inclusive), is usually 11 September ([[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]), but falls on 12 September in years before the Gregorian leap year. Also, a seven- to eight-year gap between the Ethiopian and Gregorian calendars results from an alternate calculation in determining the date of the [[Annunciation]] of [[Jesus]].\n\nAnother prominent calendrical system was developed around 300 BC by the [[Oromo people|Oromo]]. A lunar-stellar calendar, this [[Oromo calendar]] relies on astronomical observations of the moon in conjunction with seven particular stars or constellations. Oromo months (stars/lunar phases) are Bittottessa (Iangulum), Camsa (Pleiades), Bufa (Aldebarran), Waxabajjii (Belletrix), Obora Gudda (Central Orion-Saiph), Obora Dikka (Sirius), Birra (full moon), Cikawa (gibbous moon), Sadasaa (quarter moon), Abrasa (large crescent), Ammaji (medium crescent), and Gurrandala (small crescent).<ref>{{cite web|first=Lawrence R |last=Doyle |url=http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |title=The Borana Calendar Reinterpreted |work=tusker.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029073246/http://www.tusker.com/Archaeo/art.currentanthro.htm |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Time===\n[[Time in Ethiopia]] is counted differently from in many Western countries. The Ethiopian day is reckoned as beginning at 6 AM as opposed to 12 AM, concurrently with sunrise throughout the year. To convert between the Ethiopian clock and Western clocks, one must add (or subtract) 6 hours to the Western time. For example, 2 AM local Addis Ababa time is called \"8 at night\" in Ethiopia, while 8 PM is called \"2 in the evening\".\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Ethiopian cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Ethiopian dishes and foods}}\n[[File:Alicha 1.jpg|thumb|Typical Ethiopian cuisine: ''[[Injera]]'' (pancake-like bread) and several kinds of ''wat'' (stew)]]\nThe best-known [[Ethiopian cuisine]] consists of various types of thick [[meat]] [[stew]]s, known as ''[[wat (food)|wat]]'' in Ethiopian culture, and [[vegetable]] side dishes served atop [[injera]], a large [[sourdough]] [[flatbread]] made of [[teff]] flour. This is not eaten with utensils, but instead one uses the injera to scoop up the entr\u00e9es and side dishes.

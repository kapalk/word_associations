This has been correlated with the introduction of pottery, pigs, and certain fishing techniques.\n\nIn the 18th century, traders brought the [[sweet potato]] to New Guinea, where it was adopted and became part of the staples. [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese traders]] had obtained it from South America and introduced it to the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]].<ref>[[#Swadling|Swadling]], p. 282</ref> The far higher crop yields from sweet potato gardens radically transformed traditional agriculture and societies. Sweet potato largely supplanted the previous staple, [[Colocasia esculenta|taro]], and resulted in a significant increase in population in the highlands.\n\nAlthough by the late 20th century [[headhunting]] and [[cannibalism]] had been practically eradicated, in the past they were practised in many parts of the country as part of rituals related to warfare and taking in enemy spirits or powers.<ref>Knauft, Bruce M.

In 1545, he noted the resemblance of the people to those he had earlier seen along the [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]] coast of Africa. Guinea, in its turn, is etymologically derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese word]] ''[[Guinea (region)|Guin\u00e9]]''. The name is one of several [[Toponymy|toponyms]] sharing similar [[Placename etymology|etymologies]], ultimately meaning \"land of the blacks\" or similar meanings, in reference to the [[dark skin]] of the inhabitants.\n[[File:New Guinea (1884-1919).png|thumb|New Guinea from 1884 to 1919. [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[British Empire|Britain]] controlled the eastern half of New Guinea.]]\nIn the nineteenth century, Germany ruled the northern half of the country for some decades, beginning in 1884, as a colony named [[German New Guinea]]. In 1914 after the outbreak of [[World War I]], Australian forces landed and [[Australian occupation of German New Guinea|captured German New Guinea in a small military campaign]] and occupied it throughout the war. After the war, in which Germany and the Central Powers were defeated, the [[League of Nations]] authorised Australia to administer this area as a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory.\n\nThe southern half of the country had been colonised in 1884 by the United Kingdom as [[Territory of Papua|British New Guinea]]. With the [[Papua Act 1905]], the UK transferred this territory to the newly formed [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], which took on its administration. Additionally, from 1905, British New Guinea was renamed as the [[Territory of Papua]]. In contrast to establishing an Australian mandate in former German New Guinea, the League of Nations determined that Papua was an External Territory of the Australian Commonwealth; as a matter of law it remained a British possession. The difference in legal status meant that until 1949, Papua and New Guinea had entirely separate administrations, both controlled by Australia. These conditions contributed to the complexity of organising the country's post-independence legal system.\n\n[[File:Buna (AWM 014008).jpg|thumb|left|Australian forces attack Japanese positions during the [[Battle of Buna\u2013Gona]], 7 January 1943.]]\nDuring [[World War II]], the [[New Guinea campaign]] (1942\u20131945) was one of the major military campaigns and conflicts between Japan and the Allies.

The nation established independence from [[Australia]] on 16 September 1975, becoming a [[Commonwealth realm]], continuing to share [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] as its head of state. It maintains close ties with Australia, which continues to be its largest aid donor.

A renewed [[Bougainville Civil War|uprising]] on Bougainville started in 1988 and claimed 20,000 lives until it was resolved in 1997. Bougainville had been the chief mining region of the country, generating 40% of the national budget. The native peoples felt they were bearing the adverse environmental effects of the mining, which poisoned the land, water and air, without gaining a fair share of the profits.<ref>\"[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/onairhighlights/428966 New report doubles death toll on Bougainville to 20,000]\".

The constitutional convention, which prepared the draft constitution, and Australia, the outgoing metropolitan power, had thought that Papua New Guinea would not remain a monarchy. The founders, however, considered that imperial honours had a cachet.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bradford |first=Sarah |title=Elizabeth: A Biography of Britain's Queen |year=1997 |publisher=Riverhead Books |isbn=978-1-57322-600-4}}</ref> The monarch is represented by the [[Governor-General of Papua New Guinea]], currently [[Bob Dadae]]. Papua New Guinea (and the [[Solomon Islands]]) are unusual among Commonwealth realms in that governors-general are elected by the legislature, rather than chosen by the executive branch.\n\nThe [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Prime Minister]] heads the [[Cabinet of Papua New Guinea|cabinet]], which consists of 31 MPs from the ruling coalition, which make up the government. The current prime minister is [[Peter O'Neill]]. The [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[National Parliament of Papua New Guinea|National Parliament]] has 111 seats, of which 22 are occupied by the governors of the 22 provinces and the [[National Capital District (Papua New Guinea)|National Capital District]] (NCD). Candidates for members of parliament are voted upon when the prime minister asks the governor-general to call a national election, a maximum of five years after the previous national election.\n\nIn the early years of independence, the instability of the party system led to frequent [[motion of no confidence|votes of no confidence]] in parliament, with resulting changes of the government, but with referral to the electorate, through national elections only occurring every five years. In recent years, successive governments have passed legislation preventing such votes sooner than 18 months after a national election and within 12 months of the next election. In December 2012, the first two (of three) readings were passed to prevent votes of no confidence occurring within the first 30 months. This restriction on votes of no confidence has arguably resulted in greater stability, although perhaps at a cost of reducing the accountability of the executive branch of government.\n\nElections in PNG attract numerous candidates. After independence in 1975, members were elected by the [[first past the post|first-past-the-post]] system, with winners frequently gaining less than 15% of the vote. Electoral reforms in 2001 introduced the [[Limited Preferential Vote]] system (LPV), a version of the [[instant-runoff voting|Alternative Vote]]. The [[Papua New Guinean general election, 2007|2007 general election]] was the first to be conducted using LPV.\n\n[[File:Peter O'Neill APEC 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Prime Minister [[Peter O'Neill]]]]\n{{update|section|date=October 2012}}\nIn 2011 there was a [[2011\u201312 Papua New Guinean constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] between the parliament-elect Prime Minister, Peter O'Neill (voted into office by a large majority of MPs), and [[Michael Somare|Sir Michael Somare]], who was deemed by the supreme court (in a December Opinion, 3:2) to retain office. The stand-off between parliament and the supreme court continued until the July 2012 national elections, with legislation passed effectively removing the chief justice and subjecting the supreme court members to greater control by the legislature, as well as a series of other laws passed, for example limiting the age for a prime minister. The confrontation reached a peak, with the Deputy Prime Minister entering the supreme court during a hearing, escorted by some police, ostensibly to arrest the Chief Justice. There was strong pressure among some MPs to defer the national elections for a further six months to one year, although their powers to do that were highly questionable.\n\nThe parliament-elect prime minister and other cooler-headed MPs carried the votes for the writs for the new election to be issued, slightly late, but for the election itself to occur on time, thereby avoiding a continuation of the constitutional crisis. The crisis was tense at times, but largely restricted to the political and legal fraternity, plus some police factions. The public and public service (including most police and military) stood back. It was a period when, with increased telecommunication access and use of social media (notably Facebook and mobile phones), the public and students played some part in helping maintain restraint and demanding the leadership to adhere to constitutional processes. They insisted on having the elections so that the people could say who should be their legitimate representatives for the next five years.\n\nUnder a 2002 amendment, the leader of the party winning the largest number of seats in the election is invited by the governor-general to form the government, if he can muster the necessary majority in parliament. The process of forming such a coalition in PNG, where parties do not have much ideology, involves considerable horsetrading right up until the last moment. Peter O'Neill emerged as Papua New Guinea's prime minister after the July 2012 election, and formed a government with [[Leo Dion]], the former Governor of East New Britain Province, as deputy prime minister.\n\n=== Law ===\n[[File:Port Moresby parliament building front, by Steve Shattuck.jpg|thumb|upright|The Parliament building of Papua New Guinea in [[Port Moresby]]]]\n{{Main|Law of Papua New Guinea}}\nThe unicameral Parliament enacts legislation in the same manner as in other jurisdictions that have \"cabinet,\"{{clarify|date=September 2016}} \"responsible government,\" or \"parliamentary democracy\": it is introduced by the executive government to the legislature, debated and, if passed, becomes law when it receives royal assent by the Governor-General. Most legislation is regulation implemented by the bureaucracy under enabling legislation previously passed by Parliament.\n\nAll ordinary statutes enacted by Parliament must be consistent with the Constitution. The courts have jurisdiction to rule on the constitutionality of statutes, both in disputes before them and on a reference where there is no dispute but only an abstract question of law. Unusual among developing countries, the judicial branch of government in Papua New Guinea has remained remarkably independent, and successive executive governments have continued to respect its authority.\n\nThe \"underlying law\" (Papua New Guinea's [[common law]]) consists of principles and rules of common law and equity in English<ref>Papua New Guinea Constitution Schedule 2.2.2</ref> common law as it stood on 16 September 1975 (the date of Independence), and thereafter the decisions of PNG's own courts. The courts are directed by the Constitution and, latterly, the ''Underlying Law Act'', to take note of the \"custom\" of traditional communities. They are to determine which customs are common to the whole country and may be declared also to be part of the underlying law. In practice, this has proved extremely difficult and has been largely neglected. Statutes are largely adapted from overseas jurisdictions, primarily Australia and England. Advocacy in the courts follows the adversarial pattern of other common-law countries.\n\nThis national court system, used in towns and cities, is supported by a village court system in the more remote areas. The law underpinning the village courts is 'customary law'.\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:APEC Leaders Photo - Papua New Guinea 2018.jpg|thumb|APEC 2018 in Papua New Guinea]]\nIn foreign policy, Papua New Guinea is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], Pacific Islands Forum, and the Melanesian Spearhead Group (MSG) of countries. It was accorded Observer status within [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] in 1976, followed later by Special Observer status in 1981. It is also a member of [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] and an [[African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States|ACP]] country, associated with the European Union. The country has a low-key initiative when it comes to the Indonesia-sponsored [[genocide in West Papua]] due to its application in ASEAN, where the headquarters is in [[Jakarta]].\n\nPapua New Guinea has positive ties with [[Australia]] and countries in [[Oceania]]. It also has good ties with fellow-Christian country, the [[Philippines]], especially in the education sector. The country's policy has been focusing on ties with Southeast Asia in recent years due to its application in ASEAN, which is supported by the Philippines and co-observer [[Timor-Leste]].\n\n=== Military ===\n{{main|Papua New Guinea Defence Force}}\nThe Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) is the military organisation responsible for the defence of Papua New Guinea.\n\n=== Human rights ===\n[[File:Papua New Guinean children, men and women show their support for putting an end to violence against women during a White Ribbon Day march (21614943268).jpg|thumb|left|Papua New Guinean children, men and women show their support for putting an end to violence against women during a [[White Ribbon Campaign|White Ribbon Day]] march]]\n{{Main|Human rights in Papua New Guinea}}\n{{See also|Sexual violence in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nPapua New Guinea is often ranked as likely the worst place in the world for [[violence against women]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/05/papua-new-guinea-abuse-clinic|author=Davidson, Helen|date=5 July 2013|title=M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res opens Papua New Guinea clinic for abuse victims|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=12 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/19/papua-new-guinea-spiralling-violence|author=Davidson, Helen|date=19 July 2013|title=Papua New Guinea: a country suffering spiralling violence|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref> A 2013 study in ''[[The Lancet]]'' found that 27% of men on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, reported having raped a non-partner, while 14.1% reported having committed [[gang rape]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jewkes |first=Rachel |first2=Emma|last2=Fulu|first3=Tim|last3=Roselli|first4=Claudia|last4=Garcia-Moreno |title=Prevalence of and factors associated with non-partner rape perpetration: findings from the UN Multi-country Cross-sectional Study on Men and Violence in Asia and the Pacific |journal=[[The Lancet]] |date= 2013 |doi=10.1016/S2214-109X(13)70069-X |volume=323 |issue=4 |pages=e208-18 |pmid=25104346}}</ref> According to [[UNICEF]], nearly half of reported rape victims are under 15 years of age and 13% are under 7 years of age.<ref name=\"UNICEF2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/papuang_45211.html|title=UNICEF strives to help Papua New Guinea break cycle of violence|publisher=[[UNICEF]]|accessdate=26 February 2014|date=18 August 2008}}</ref> A report by [[ChildFund]] Australia, citing former Parliamentarian Dame [[Carol Kidu]], claimed 50% of those seeking medical help after rape are under 16, 25% are under 12, and 10% are under 8.<ref>{{cite web |author=Wiseman H |title=Stop Violence Against Women and Children in Papua New Guinea |url=https://www.childfund.org.au/sites/default/files/publications/Stop%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20PNG%202013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150827092248/https://www.childfund.org.au/sites/default/files/publications/Stop%20Violence%20Against%20Women%20and%20Children%20in%20PNG%202013.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-08-27 |website=ChildFund |date=August 2013 |accessdate=18 May 2015 |page=5 }}</ref>\n\nThe 1976 Sorcery Act imposed a penalty of up to 2 years in prison for the practice of [[black magic|\"black\" magic]], until the Act was repealed in 2013.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-22698668 PNG repeals sorcery law and expands death penalty]\".

Including all its islands, it lies between latitudes [[equator|0\u00b0]] and [[12th parallel south|12\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[140th meridian east|140\u00b0]] and [[160th meridian east|160\u00b0E]].\n\nLocated north of the Australian mainland, the country's geography is diverse and, in places, extremely rugged. A spine of mountains, the [[New Guinea Highlands]], runs the length of the island of [[New Guinea]], forming a populous [[highland (geography)|highlands]] region mostly covered with [[tropical rainforest]], and the long [[Papuan Peninsula]], known as the 'Bird's Tail'. Dense [[rainforest]]s can be found in the lowland and coastal areas as well as very large [[wetland]] areas surrounding the [[Sepik]] and [[Fly River|Fly]] rivers. This terrain has made it difficult for the country to develop transportation infrastructure. Some areas are accessible only on foot or by aeroplane.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The highest peak is [[Mount Wilhelm]] at {{convert|4509|m}}. Papua New Guinea is surrounded by [[coral reef]]s which are under close watch, in the interests of preservation.\n\nThe country is situated on the Pacific [[Ring of Fire]], at the point of collision of several [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. There are a number of active [[volcano]]es, and eruptions are frequent. Earthquakes are relatively common, sometimes accompanied by [[tsunami]]s.\n\nThe mainland of the country is the eastern half of New Guinea island, where the largest towns are also located, including [[Port Moresby]] (capital) and [[Lae]]; other major islands within Papua New Guinea include [[New Ireland (island)|New Ireland]], [[New Britain]], [[Manus Island|Manus]] and [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]].\n\nPapua New Guinea is one of the few regions close to the [[equator]] that experience [[snow]]fall, which occurs in the most elevated parts of the mainland.\n\n===Borders===\n\nThe border between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia was confirmed by treaty with Australia before independence in 1974.<ref name=\"bordertreaty1974\">{{cite web|title=Agreement between Australia and Indonesia concerning Certain Boundaries between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia (1974) ATS 26|url=http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1974/26.html|website=www3.austlii.edu.au|publisher=Austraasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library|accessdate=19 April 2017}}</ref>  The land border comprises a segment of the [[141st meridian east|141\u00b0 E meridian]] from the north coast southwards to where it meets the [[Fly River]] flowing east, then a short curve of the river's [[thalweg]] to where it meets the 141\u00b001'10\" E meridian flowing west, then southwards to the south coast.<ref name=\"bordertreaty1974\"/> The 141\u00b0 E meridian formed the entire eastern boundary of [[Dutch New Guinea]] according to its 1828 annexation proclamation.<ref name=\"VanderVeur1966\">{{cite book |last1=Van der Veur |first1=Paul W. |title=Documents and Correspondence on New Guinea's Boundaries |date=2012 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9789401537063 |nopp=Y |pages=\u00a7\u00a7 A1, D1\u2013D5 |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=ybLyCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA2 |orig-year=1966 |language=en}}</ref> [[Treaty of The Hague (1895)|In 1895]] the Dutch and British agreed to a territorial exchange, bringing the entire left bank of the Fly River into [[British New Guinea]] and moving the southern border east to the [[Torasi Estuary]].<ref name=\"VanderVeur1966\"/>\n\nThe maritime boundary with Australia was confirmed by a treaty in 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty between Australia and the Independent State of Papua New Guinea concerning Sovereignty and Maritime Boundaries in the area between the two Countries, including the area known as Torres Strait, and Related Matters [1985] ATS 4|url=http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/dfat/treaties/1985/4.html|website=www3.austlii.edu.au|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute, Australian Treaties Library|accessdate=19 April 2017}}</ref> In the [[Torres Strait]] it runs close to the mainland of New Guinea, keeping the adjacent North Western [[Torres Strait Islands]] ([[Dauan Island|Dauan]], [[Boigu Island (Queensland)|Boigu]] and [[Saibai Island|Saibai]]) under Australian sovereignty.

It is connected to the Australian segment by a shallow [[continental shelf]] across the [[Torres Strait]], which in former ages lay exposed as a [[land bridge]], particularly during [[ice age]]s when sea levels were lower than at present.\n\nConsequently, many species of birds and mammals found on New Guinea have close genetic links with corresponding species found in Australia. One notable feature in common for the two landmasses is the existence of several species of [[marsupial]] [[mammal]]s, including some [[kangaroo]]s and [[Phalangeriformes|possums]], which are not found elsewhere. Papua New Guinea is a [[Megadiverse countries|megadiverse country]].\n\nMany of the other islands within PNG territory, including New Britain, New Ireland, Bougainville, the [[Admiralty Islands]], the [[Trobriand Islands]], and the [[Louisiade Archipelago]], were never linked to New Guinea by land bridges.

All the Australasian lands are home to the [[Antarctic flora]], descended from the flora of southern Gondwana, including the [[Pinophyta|coniferous]] [[podocarpaceae|podocarps]] and ''[[Araucaria]]'' pines, and the broadleafed southern beech (''[[Nothofagus]]''). These plant families are still present in Papua New Guinea.\n\nAs the Indo-Australian Plate (which includes landmasses of [[India]], Australia, and the Indian Ocean floor in between) drifts north, it collides with the [[Eurasian Plate]]. The collision of the two plates pushed up the [[Himalayas]], the Indonesian islands, and New Guinea's Central Range. The Central Range is much younger and higher than the mountains of Australia, so high that it is home to rare equatorial [[glacier]]s.

The rugged terrain\u2014including high mountain ranges and valleys, swamps and islands\u2014and high cost of developing infrastructure, combined with other factors (including serious law and order problems in some centres and the system of customary land title) makes it difficult for outside developers. Local developers are handicapped by years of deficient investment in education, health, ICT and access to finance. Agriculture, for subsistence and cash crops, provides a livelihood for 85% of the population and continues to provide some 30% of GDP. Mineral deposits, including gold, [[Petroleum|oil]], and copper, account for 72% of export earnings. [[Elaeis guineensis|Oil palm]] production has grown steadily over recent years (largely from estates and with extensive outgrower output), with [[palm oil]] now the main agricultural export. In households participating, coffee remains the major export crop (produced largely in the Highlands provinces), followed by [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coconut oil]]/[[copra]] from the coastal areas, each largely produced by smallholders and tea, produced on estates and rubber.

There is virtually no freehold title; the few existing freeholds are automatically converted to state lease when they are transferred between vendor and purchaser. Unalienated land is owned under customary title by traditional landowners. The precise nature of the [[seisin]] varies from one culture to another. Many writers portray land as in the communal ownership of traditional clans; however, closer studies usually show that the smallest portions of land whose ownership cannot be further divided are held by the individual heads of extended families and their descendants or their descendants alone if they have recently died.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThis is a matter of vital importance because a problem of economic development is identifying the membership of customary landowning groups and the owners. Disputes between mining and forestry companies and landowner groups often devolve on the issue of whether the companies entered into contractual relations for the use of land with the true owners. Customary property\u2014usually land\u2014cannot be devised by will. It can only be inherited according to the custom of the deceased's people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The Lands Act was amended in 2010 along with the Land Group Incorporation Act, intended to improve the management of state land, mechanisms for dispute resolution over land, and to enable customary landowners to be better able to access finance and possible partnerships over portions of their land, if they seek to develop it for urban or rural economic activities. The Land Group Incorporation Act requires more specific identification of the customary landowners than hitherto and their more specific authorisation before any land arrangements are determined; (a major issue in recent years has been a land grab, using, or rather misusing, the Lease-Leaseback provision under the Land Act, notably using 'Special Agricultural and Business Leases' (SABLs) to acquire vast tracts of customary land, purportedly for agricultural projects, but in an almost all cases as a back-door mechanism for securing tropical forest resources for logging\u2014circumventing the more exacting requirements of the Forest Act, for securing Timber Permits (which must comply with sustainability requirements and be competitively secured, and with the customary landowners approval).

They paint themselves and dress up with [[feather]]s, [[pearl]]s and animal skins to represent birds, trees or mountain spirits. Sometimes an important event, such as a legendary battle, is enacted at such a musical festival.\n\nThe country possesses one (1) [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]], namely, [[Kuk Swamp|Kuk Early Agricultural Site]], which was inscribed in 2008. The country, however, has no elements inscribed yet in the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]], despite having one of the widest array of intangible cultural heritage elements in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/887|title=Kuk Early Agricultural Site|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|website=whc.unesco.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/state/papua-new-guinea-PG|title=Papua New Guinea - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO|website=ich.unesco.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nSport is an important part of Papua New Guinean culture and [[rugby league]] is by far the most popular sport.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hadfield |first=Dave |title=Island gods high in a dream world |work=[[The Independent]] |date=8 October 1995 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/island-gods-high-in-a-dream-world-1576603.html |accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref> In a nation where communities are far apart and many people live at a minimal subsistence level, rugby league has been described as a replacement for tribal warfare as a way of explaining the local enthusiasm for the game (a matter of life or death). Many Papua New Guineans have become instant celebrities by representing their country or playing in an overseas professional league. Even Australian rugby league players who have played in the annual [[State of Origin series]], which is celebrated feverishly every year in PNG, are among the most well-known people throughout the nation.\n\nState of Origin is a highlight of the year for most Papua New Guineans, although the support is so passionate that many people have died over the years in violent clashes supporting their team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/world/three-dead-in-png-after-state-of-origin-violence-20090626-cywd.html |title=Three dead in PNG after State of Origin violence |publisher=BrisbaneTimes.com.au |date=26 June 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> The [[Papua New Guinea national rugby league team]] usually plays against the Australian Prime Minister's XIII (a selection of NRL players) each year, normally in Port Moresby.\n\nAlthough not as popular, [[Australian rules football]] is more significant in another way, as [[Papua New Guinea national Australian rules football team|the national team]] is ranked second, only after Australia. Other major sports which have a part in the Papua New Guinea sporting landscape are [[association football]], [[rugby union]], [[basketball]] and, in eastern Papua, [[cricket]].\n\nThe capital city, Port Moresby, hosted the [[Pacific Games]] in 2015.\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main|Education in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nA large proportion of the population is [[Literacy|illiterate]],<ref name=\"hdrstats.undp.org\">{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_PNG.html|title=Papua New Guinea HDI Rank \u2013 145|work=2007/2008 Human Development Report, Hdrstats.undp.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429193232/http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/data_sheets/cty_ds_PNG.html|archivedate=2009-04-29|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> with women predominating in this area.<ref name=\"hdrstats.undp.org\" /> Much of the education in PNG is provided by church institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirche-in-not.de/aktuelle-meldungen/2009/03-06-papua-neuguinea-weltgebetstag-frauen-2009 |title=Kichte-in-not.de |publisher=Kirche-in-not.de |date= 6 March 2009|accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> This includes 500 schools of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Papua New Guinea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nmz-mission.de/de.partner/de.papua-neuguinea/de.papua-neuguinea.2/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231014835/http://www.nmz-mission.de/de.partner/de.papua-neuguinea/de.papua-neuguinea.2/index.html |archivedate=2010-12-31 |title=Evangelisch-Lutherische Kirche in Papua-Neuguinea |publisher=NMZ-mission.de |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> Papua New Guinea has six universities apart from other major tertiary institutions. The two founding universities are the [[University of Papua New Guinea]], based in the [[National Capital District (Papua New Guinea)|National Capital District]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Vahau, Alfred |url=http://www.upng.ac.pg/index.html |title=University of Papua New Guinea |publisher=Upng.ac.pg |date=5 January 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref> and the [[Papua New Guinea University of Technology]], based outside of [[Lae]], in [[Morobe Province]].\n\nThe four other universities which were once colleges were established recently after gaining government recognition. These are the [[University of Goroka]] in the Eastern Highlands province, [[Divine Word University]] (run by the [[Catholic Church]]'s [[Society of the Divine Word|Divine Word Missionaries]]) in [[Madang Province]], [[Papua New Guinea University of Natural Resources and Environment|Vudal University]] in [[East New Britain Province]] and [[Pacific Adventist University]] (run by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]) in the National Capital District.\n\n== Science and technology ==\nPapua New Guinea's ''National Vision 2050'' was adopted in 2009. This has led to the establishment of the Research, Science and Technology Council. At its gathering in November 2014, the Council re-emphasised the need to focus on sustainable development through [[Science and technology in Pacific Island countries|science and technology]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100129-1|location=Paris|pages=693\u2013731}}</ref>\n\n''Vision 2050''<nowiki/>'s medium-term priorities are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* emerging industrial technology for downstream processing;\n* infrastructure technology for the economic corridors;\n* knowledge-based technology;\n* science and engineering education; and\n* to reach the target of investing 5% of GDP in research and development by 2050. (There is no recent data for this indicator.)\nAccording to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science, Papua New Guinea had the largest number of publications (110) among Pacific Island states in 2014, followed by Fiji (106). Nine out of ten scientific publications from Papua New Guinea focused on immunology, genetics, biotechnology and microbiology. Nine out of ten were also co-authored by scientists from other countries, mainly Australia, the United States of America, United Kingdom, Spain and Switzerland.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nForestry is an important economic resource for Papua New Guinea but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, are some of the obstacles to introducing automated machinery and design. Policy-makers need to turn their attention to eliminating these barriers, in order for forestry to make a more efficient and sustainable contribution to national economic development.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn Papua New Guinea, renewable energy sources represent two-thirds of the total electricity supply.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, the Secretariat of the [[Pacific Community]] observed that, 'while Fiji, Papua New Guinea and Samoa are leading the way with large-scale hydropower projects, there is enormous potential to expand the deployment of other renewable energy options such as solar, wind, geothermal and ocean-based energy sources'.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.spc.int/edd/fr/section-01/energy-overview/energy?start=12|title=Pacific-first centre of excellence for renewable energy and energy efficiency takes shape|last=|first=|date=18 June 2015|work=Secretariat of Pacific Community press release|access-date=17 March 2017}}</ref> The European Union has funded the Renewable Energy in Pacific Island Countries Developing Skills and Capacity programme (EPIC).

The programme resulted from the signing of an agreement in February 2014 between the European Union and the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. The other beneficiaries are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Transport ==\n{{Main|Transport in Papua New Guinea}}\n\nTransport in Papua New Guinea is heavily limited by the country's mountainous terrain. As a result, air travel is the single most important form of transport for human and high density/value freight. Airplanes made it possible to open up the country during its early colonial period. Even today the two largest cities, [[Port Moresby]] and [[Lae]], are only directly connected by planes. Port Moresby is not linked by road to any of the other major towns, and many remote villages can only be reached by light aircraft or on foot.\n\n[[Jacksons International Airport]] is the major international airport in Papua New Guinea, located {{convert|5|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from Port Moresby. In addition to two international airfields, Papua New Guinea has 578 airstrips, most of which are unpaved.<ref name=\"cia\">{{cite web |title=Papua New Guinea |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |location=Langley, Virginia |year=2012 |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pp.html |accessdate=5 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Papua New Guinea}}\n*[[Outline of Papua New Guinea]]{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n{{Free-content attribution\n\n | title = UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO Publishing\n| page numbers = 535\u2013555\n| source = \n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf\n| license statement URL = \n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n{{Refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Biskup, Peter, B.

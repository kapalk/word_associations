'''Republic of Senegal''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|R\u00e9publique du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal}}), is a country in [[West Africa]]. Senegal is bordered by [[Mauritania]] in the north, [[Mali]] to the east, [[Guinea]] to the southeast, and [[Guinea-Bissau]] to the southwest. Senegal also borders [[The Gambia]], a country occupying a narrow sliver of land along the banks of the [[Gambia River]], which separates Senegal's southern region of [[Casamance]] from the rest of the country. Senegal also shares a maritime border with [[Cape Verde]]. Senegal's economic and political capital is [[Dakar]].\n\nThe [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential republic]]  is the westernmost country in the mainland of the [[Old World]], or [[Afro-Eurasia]],<ref>Janet H. Gritzner, Charles F. Gritzner \u2013 2009, Senegal \u2013 Page 8</ref> and owes its name to the [[Senegal River]], which borders it to the east and north. Senegal covers a land area of almost {{convert|197000|km2}} and has an estimated population of about {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Senegal}}|,||}}/1e6 round 0}} million.{{UN_Population|ref}} The climate is typically [[Sahel]]ian, though there is a [[Wet season|rainy season]].\n\n== Etymology ==\nProbably from a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] transliteration of the name of the [[Zenaga language|Zenaga]] also known as the [[Sanhaja]],<ref name=fas>{{Cite web|url=https://theculturetrip.com/africa/senegal/articles/the-real-story-behind-senegals-name/|title=The Real Story Behind Senegal\u2019s Name|first=Beetle|last=Holloway|website=Culture Trip}}</ref> or a combination of the supreme deity in {{w|Serer religion}} (''Rog Sene'') and ''o gal'' meaning ''body of water'' in the [[Serer language]]. Alternatively, the name could derive from the [[Wolof language|Wolof]] phrase \"Sunuu Gaal,\" which means \"our boat.\"\n\n== Cultures and influences ==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2019}}\nThe territory of modern Senegal has been inhabited by various ethnic groups since [[prehistory]]. Organized kingdoms emerged around the seventh century, and parts of the country were ruled by prominent regional empires such as the [[Jolof Empire]]. The present state of Senegal has its roots in European colonialism, which began during the mid-15th century, when various European powers began competing for trade in the area. The establishment of coastal trading posts gradually led to control of the mainland, culminating in French rule of the area by the 19th century, albeit amid much local resistance. Senegal peacefully attained independence from France in 1960, and has since been among the more politically stable countries in Africa.\n\nSenegal's economy is centered mostly on commodities and natural resources. Major industries are fish processing, [[phosphate]] mining, fertilizer production, [[petroleum]] refining, construction materials, and ship construction and repair. As in most African nations, agriculture is a major sector, with Senegal producing several important cash crops, including [[peanut]]s, [[sugarcane]], [[cotton]], [[green bean]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[melon]]s, and [[mango]]es.<ref name=fas/> Owing to its relative stability, tourism and hospitality are also burgeoning sectors.\n\nWith it being a multiethnic and secular nation, Senegal is predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] with [[Sufism|Sufi]] and [[traditional African religion|animist]] influences. French is the [[official language]], although many native languages are spoken and recognized. Since April 2012, Senegal's president has been [[Macky Sall]]. Senegal has been a member of the [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] since 1970.\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Senegal}}\n\n===Early and pre-colonial eras===\nArchaeological findings throughout the area indicate that Senegal was inhabited in prehistoric times and has been continuously occupied by various ethnic groups. Some kingdoms were created around the 7th century: [[Takrur]] in the 9th century, {{ILL|Namandiru|wo}} and the [[Jolof Empire]] during the 13th and 14th centuries. Eastern Senegal was once part of the [[Ghana Empire]].\n\nIslam was introduced through [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] contact with the [[Almoravid dynasty]] of the [[Maghreb]], who in turn propagated it with the help of the Almoravids, and Toucouleur allies. This movement faced resistance from ethnicities of traditional religions, the Serers in particular.<ref>Klein, Martin A., ''Islam and Imperialism in Senegal: Sine-Saloum, 1847\u20131914'', p. 7, Edinburgh University Press (1968) {{ISBN|0-8047-0621-2}}</ref><ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La civilisation Sereer, Pangool,'' p. 13. Dakar, Nouvelles Editions Africaines (1990), {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>\n\nIn the 13th and 14th centuries, the area came under the influence of the empires to the east; the Jolof Empire of Senegal was also founded during this time. In the Senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was [[Slavery in Africa|enslaved]], typically as a result of captives taken in warfare.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 \"Slavery\"], ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica's Guide to Black History'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006131931/http://www.britannica.com/blackhistory/article-24157 |date=6 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century the Jolof Empire grew more powerful, having united [[Cayor]] and the kingdoms of [[Baol]], [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]], [[Saloum]], [[Waalo]], [[Futa Tooro]] and [[Bambouk]], or much of present-day West Africa. The empire was a voluntary confederacy of various states rather than an empire built on military conquest.<ref name=charles/><ref>Ham, Anthony. ''West Africa.''

Due to internal political difficulties, the Federation broke up on 20 August, when Senegal and French Sudan (renamed the Republic of [[Mali]]) each proclaimed independence.\n\n[[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]] was Senegal's first president in September 1960. Senghor was a very well-read man, educated in France. He was a poet and philosopher who personally drafted the Senegalese national anthem, \"Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons\". Pro-African, he advocated a brand of African socialism.<ref>''A Critical bibliography of French literature: in three parts. The Twentieth.'' Edited by David Clark Cabeen, Richard A. Brooks, Douglas W. Alden</ref>\n\n[[File:Colonial Saint Louis.jpg|thumb|Colonial [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint Louis]] c. 1900. Europeans and Africans on the Rue Lebon.]] \nIn 1980, President Senghor decided to retire from politics. The next year, he transferred power in 1981 to his hand-picked successor, [[Abdou Diouf]]. Former prime minister [[Mamadou Dia]], who was Senghor's rival, ran for election in 1983 against Diouf, but lost. Senghor moved to France, where he died at the age of 96.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Boubacar Lam]] discovered Senegalese oral history that was initially compiled by the [[Toucouleur people|Tuculor]] noble, [[Yoro Dy\u00e2o]], not long after [[World War I]], which documented migrations into [[West Africa]] from the [[Nile Valley]]; ethnic groups, from the [[Senegal River]] to the [[Niger Delta]], retained traditions of having an eastern origin.<ref name=\"AfrAm\">{{cite book |last1=Gordon |first1=Jane |title=A Companion to African-American Studies |date=15 April 2008 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |page=463 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ODmpx1fgJNIC&pg=PA463|isbn=978-1-4051-5466-6}}</ref>\n\nSenegal joined with [[the Gambia]] to form the nominal [[Senegambia Confederation]] on 1 February 1982. However, the union was dissolved in 1989. Despite peace talks, a southern separatist group ([[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] or MFDC) in the [[Casamance]] region has clashed sporadically with government forces since 1982 in the [[Casamance conflict]]. In the early 21st century, violence has subsided and President [[Macky Sall]] held talks with rebels in Rome in December 2012.<ref>[http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=135&regionSelect=2-Southern_Africa# \"[[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]]: Senegal: Casamance, In-depth Developments since 2005\"], ''Conflict Encyclopedia''</ref>\n\nAbdou Diouf was president between 1981 and 2000. He encouraged broader political participation, reduced government involvement in the economy, and widened Senegal's diplomatic engagements, particularly with other developing nations. Domestic politics on occasion spilled over into street violence, border tensions, and a violent separatist movement in the southern region of the Casamance. Nevertheless, Senegal's commitment to democracy and human rights strengthened. Abdou Diouf served four terms as president.\n\nIn the presidential election of 1999, opposition leader [[Abdoulaye Wade]] defeated Diouf in an election deemed free and fair by international observers. Senegal experienced its second peaceful transition of power, and its first from one political party to another. On 30 December 2004 President Wade announced that he would sign a peace treaty with the separatist group in the Casamance region. This, however, has yet to be implemented. There was a round of talks in 2005, but the results have not yet yielded a resolution.\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:Macky Sall - 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Macky Sall]], President of Senegal (2012\u2013present)]]\n[[File:Abdoulaye Wade in 16-05-2007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Abdoulaye Wade]], President of Senegal (2000\u20132012)]]\n\nSenegal is a [[republic]] with a presidency; the president is [[Elections in Senegal|elected]] every five years as of 2001, previously being seven years, by adult voters. The first president, [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]], was a poet and writer, and was the first African elected to the ''Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise''. Senegal's second president, [[Abdou Diouf]], later served as general secretary of the ''Organisation de la Francophonie''. The third president was [[Abdoulaye Wade]], a lawyer. The current president is [[Macky Sall]], elected in March 2012.\n\nSenegal has more than 80 political parties. The [[unicameral]] parliament consists of the [[National Assembly of Senegal|National Assembly]], which has 150&nbsp;seats (a [[Senate (Senegal)|Senate]] was in place from 1999 to 2001 and 2007 to 2012).<ref name=cia>{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=CIA |work=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Senegal |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sg.html |year=2009|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref> An independent judiciary also exists in Senegal. The nation's highest courts that deal with business issues are the constitutional council and the court of justice, members of which are named by the president.\n\n===Political culture===\nCurrently, Senegal has a quasi-democratic political culture, one of the more successful post-colonial democratic transitions in Africa. Local administrators are appointed and held accountable by the president. [[Marabout]]s, religious leaders of the various [[Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal]], have also exercised a strong political influence in the country especially during Wade's presidency. In 2009, [[Freedom House]] downgraded Senegal's status from \"Free\" to \"Partially Free\", based on increased centralisation of power in the executive. However, it has since recovered its Free status by 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/senegal-0#.VEWVY_nF-So|title=Senegal - Country report - Freedom in the World - 2014|website=Freedomhouse.org|accessdate=23 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, Senegal finished in 12th position on the [[Ibrahim Index of African Governance]].<ref name=\"ibrahim_index\">{{cite web|url=http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/section/the-ibrahim-index |title=The Ibrahim Index \u00bb Mo Ibrahim Foundation |publisher=Moibrahimfoundation.org |accessdate=3 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229141051/http://www.moibrahimfoundation.org/en/section/the-ibrahim-index |archivedate=29 December 2011 }}</ref> The Ibrahim Index is a comprehensive measure of African governance (limited to [[sub-Saharan Africa]] until 2008), based on a number of different variables which reflect the success with which governments deliver essential political goods to their citizens.

The Serer people stood out as one of this group, who spent over one thousand years resisting Islamization (see [[Serer history (medieval era to present)|Serer history]]). Although many Serers are Christians or Muslim, their conversion to Islam in particular is very recent, who converted on their own free will rather than by force, although force had been tried centuries earlier unsuccessfully (see [[the Battle of Fandane-Thiouthioune]]).<ref>{{cite book|author1=Hans Bressers|author2=Walter A.

In Murid communities, which place more emphasis on the work ethic than on literary Quranic studies, the term ''daara'' often applies to work groups devoted to working for a religious leader. Other Islamic groups include the much older Q\u0101diriyya order and the Senegalese [[Layene|Laayeen]] order, which is prominent among the coastal Lebu. Today, most Senegalese children study at ''daara''s for several years, memorizing as much of the Qur'an as they can. Some of them continue their religious studies at councils (''majlis'') or at the growing number of private Arabic schools and publicly funded Franco-Arabic schools.\n\nSmall Roman Catholic communities are mainly found in coastal Serer, [[Jola people|Jola]], [[Mankanya people|Mankanya]] and Balant populations, and in eastern Senegal among the Bassari and Coniagui. The Protestant churches are mainly attended by immigrants but during the second half of the 20th century Protestant churches led by Senegalese leaders from different ethnic groups have evolved. In Dakar Catholic and Protestant rites are practiced by the Lebanese, Cape Verdean, European, and American immigrant populations, and among certain Africans of other countries as well as by the Senegalese themselves. Although Islam is Senegal's majority religion, Senegal's first president, [[L\u00e9opold S\u00e9dar Senghor]], was a Catholic Serer.\n\n[[Serer religion]] encompasses a belief in a supreme deity called [[Roog]] ([[Koox]] among the [[Cangin languages|Cangin]]), [[Serer creation myth|Serer cosmogony]], [[Religious cosmology|cosmology]] and [[divination]] ceremonies such as the annual ''Xoy'' (or ''Khoye'') ceremony precided over by the Serer [[Saltigue]]s (high priests and priestesses).

[[Chicken as food|Chicken]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[pea]]s, [[Egg (food)|eggs]], and [[beef]] are also used in Senegalese cooking, but not [[pork]], due to the nation's largely [[Muslim]] population. [[Peanut]]s, the primary crop of Senegal, as well as [[couscous]], [[white rice]], [[sweet potato]]es, [[lentil]]s, [[black-eyed pea]]s and various vegetables, are also incorporated into many recipes. Meats and vegetables are typically stewed or marinated in herbs and spices, and then poured over rice or couscous, or eaten with bread.\n\nPopular fresh juices are made from [[Hibiscus|bissap]], [[ginger]], ''buy'' (pronounced 'buoy', which is the fruit of the [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] tree, also known as \"monkey bread fruit\"), [[mango]], or other fruit or wild trees (most famously [[soursop]], which is called ''corossol'' in French).

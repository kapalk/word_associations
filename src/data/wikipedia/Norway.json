According to the traditional dominant view, the first component was originally [[:wikt:nor\u00f0r|''nor\u00f0r'']], a [[cognate]] of English ''north'', so the full name was ''Nor\u00f0r [[wikt:vegr|vegr]]'', \"the way northwards\", referring to the sailing route along the Norwegian coast, and contrasting with ''su\u00f0rvegar'' \"southern way\" (from [[Old Norse]] [[:wikt:su\u00f0r|su\u00f0r]]) for (Germany), and ''austrvegr'' \"eastern way\" (from [[:wikt:austr|austr]]) for the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]].

The interpretation as \"northern\", as reflected in the English and Latin forms of the name, would then have been due to later [[folk etymology]].

The oldest finds are stone tools dating from 9,500 to 6,000 BC, discovered in [[Finnmark]] ([[Komsa culture]]) in the north and [[Rogaland]] ([[Fosna-Hensbacka culture|Fosna culture]]) in the south-west. However, theories about two altogether different cultures (the Komsa culture north of the [[Arctic Circle]] being one and the Fosna culture from [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] to [[Oslofjord]] being the other) were rendered obsolete in the 1970s.\n\nMore recent finds along the entire coast revealed to archaeologists that the difference between the two can simply be ascribed to different types of tools and not to different cultures. Coastal fauna provided a means of livelihood for fishermen and hunters, who may have made their way along the southern coast about 10,000 BC when the interior was still covered with ice. It is now thought that these so-called \"Arctic\" peoples came from the south and followed the coast northward considerably later.\n\nIn the southern part of the country are dwelling sites dating from about 5,000 BC. Finds from these sites give a clearer idea of the life of the hunting and fishing peoples. The implements vary in shape and mostly are made of different kinds of stone; those of later periods are more skilfully made. [[Rock carvings]] (i.e. petroglyphs) have been found, usually near hunting and fishing grounds. They represent game such as [[deer]], [[reindeer]], [[Moose|elk]], bears, birds, [[Earless seal|seals]], whales, and fish (especially [[salmon]] and [[halibut]]), all of which were vital to the way of life of the coastal peoples. The [[rock carvings at Alta]] in Finnmark, the largest in Scandinavia, were made at sea level from 4,200 to 500 BC and mark the progression of the land as the sea rose after the last ice age ended.\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\n{{Main|Nordic Bronze Age}}\n[[File:Bronze Age boats.png|thumb|right|[[Nordic Bronze Age]] [[rock carvings]] at [[Steinkjer]], [[Central Norway]]]]\nBetween 3000 and 2500 BC, new settlers ([[Corded Ware culture]]) arrived in [[eastern Norway]]. They were [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] [[farmers]] who grew grain and kept cows and sheep. The hunting-fishing population of the west coast was also gradually replaced by farmers, though hunting and fishing remained useful secondary means of livelihood.\n\nFrom about 1500 BC, [[bronze]] was gradually introduced, but the use of stone implements continued; Norway had few riches to barter for bronze goods, and the few finds consist mostly of elaborate weapons and brooches that only chieftains could afford. Huge burial cairns built close to the sea as far north as [[Harstad]] and also inland in the south are characteristic of this period. The motifs of the rock carvings differ from those typical of the [[Stone Age]]. Representations of the Sun, animals, trees, weapons, ships, and people are all strongly stylised.\n\nThousands of [[rock carving]]s from this period depict ships, and the large stone burial monuments known as [[stone ship]]s, suggest that ships and seafaring played an important role in the culture at large. The depicted ships most likely represent sewn plank built canoes used for warfare, fishing and trade. These ship types may have their origin as far back as the neolithic period and they continue into the Pre-Roman Iron Age, as exemplified by the [[Hjortspring boat]].<ref>Ling 2008.

The dead were cremated, and their graves contain few burial goods. During the first four centuries AD, the people of Norway were in contact with Roman-occupied [[Gaul]]. About 70 Roman bronze cauldrons, often used as burial urns, have been found. Contact with the civilised countries farther south brought a knowledge of [[runes]]; the oldest known Norwegian runic inscription dates from the 3rd century. At this time, the amount of settled area in the country increased, a development that can be traced by coordinated studies of [[topography]], [[archaeology]], and place-names. The oldest root names, such as nes, vik, and b\u00f8 (\"cape,\" \"bay,\" and \"farm\"), are of great antiquity, dating perhaps from the Bronze Age, whereas the earliest of the groups of compound names with the suffixes vin (\"meadow\") or heim (\"settlement\"), as in Bj\u01ebrgvin (Bergen) or S\u01ffheim (Seim), usually date from the 1st century AD.\n\nArchaeologists first made the decision to divide the Iron Age of Northern Europe into distinct pre-Roman and [[Roman Iron Age]]s after Emil Vedel unearthed a number of Iron Age artefacts in 1866 on the island of [[Bornholm]].<ref>Vedel, ''Bornholms Oldtidsminder og Oldsager'', (Copenhagen 1886).</ref> They did not exhibit the same permeating Roman influence seen in most other artefacts from the early centuries AD, indicating that parts of northern Europe had not yet come into contact with the Romans at the beginning of the [[Iron Age]].\n\n=== Migration period ===\n{{Main|Migration period}}\n{{See also|Petty kingdoms of Norway}}\nThe destruction of the [[Western Roman Empire]] by the [[Germanic peoples]] in the 5th century is characterised by rich finds, including [[tribal chief]]s' graves containing magnificent weapons and gold objects.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Hill forts were built on precipitous rocks for defence.

By the 9th century, each of these small states had [[Thing (assembly)|''things'']] (local or regional assemblies) for negotiating and settling disputes. The ''thing'' meeting places, each eventually with a [[h\u00f6rgr]] (open-air sanctuary) or a [[heathen hof]] (temple; literally \"hill\"), were usually situated on the oldest and best farms, which belonged to the chieftains and wealthiest farmers. The regional ''things'' united to form even larger units: assemblies of deputy yeomen from several regions. In this way, the ''lagting'' (assemblies for negotiations and lawmaking) developed. The Gulating had its meeting place by [[Sognefjord]] and may have been the centre of an aristocratic confederation{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} along the western fjords and islands called the Gulatingslag. The Frostating was the assembly for the leaders in the [[Trondheimsfjord]] area; the [[Earls of Lade]], near [[Trondheim]], seem to have enlarged the Frostatingslag by adding the coastland from [[Romsdalsfjord]] to [[Lofoten]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Viking Age ===\n{{Main|Viking Age}}\n{{See also|Unification of Norway|Hereditary Kingdom of Norway}}\n{{multiple image|align = right|direction = diagonal|total_width = 280|image1 = Le bateau viking dOseberg (4835828216).jpg|caption1 = The [[Oseberg ship]] at the [[Viking Ship Museum (Oslo)|Viking Ship Museum]] in Oslo.|image2 = Viking swords at Bergen Museum.jpg|caption2 = [[Viking sword]]s found in Norway, preserved at the [[Bergen Museum]].}}\n[[File:Gjermundbu helmet - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|The [[Gjermundbu helmet]] found in [[Buskerud]] is the only known reconstructable [[Viking Age]] helmet]]\nFrom the 8th to the 10th century, the wider Scandinavian region was the source of [[Viking]]s.

One of the most important sources for the history of the 11th century Vikings is the treaty between the Icelanders and Olaf Haraldsson, king of Norway circa 1015 to 1028.<ref>Jones, Gwyn, A history of the Vikings (Oxford 2001).</ref> This is largely attributed to the missionary kings [[Olaf I of Norway|Olav Tryggvasson]] and [[Olaf II of Norway|St. Olav]]. [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon the Good]] was Norway's first Christian king, in the mid-10th century, though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected. Born sometime in between 963\u2013969, Olav Tryggvasson set off raiding in England with 390 ships. He attacked London during this raiding. Arriving back in Norway in 995, Olav landed in [[Moster (island)|Moster]]. There he built a church which became the first [[Old Moster Church|Christian church]] ever built in Norway. From Moster, Olav sailed north to [[Trondheim]] where he was proclaimed King of Norway by the Eyrathing in 995.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 95.</ref>\n\n[[Feudalism]] never really developed in Norway or Sweden, as it did in the rest of Europe. However, the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character. The [[Hanseatic League]] forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy. The League had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the Hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying. The League's monopolistic control over the economy of Norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, to the degree that no real [[burgher (title)|burgher]] class existed in Norway.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 201.</ref>\n\n=== Civil war and peak of power ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)}}\n{{See also|Greater Norway|Civil war era in Norway}}\n[[File:Norwegian Hereditary Empire excluding Greenland.png|thumb|[[Kingdom of Norway (872\u20131397)|Norwegian Kingdom]] at its greatest extent, 13th century]]\nFrom the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace.<ref>Stenersen: 36</ref>  In 1130, the [[civil war era in Norway|civil war era]] broke out on the basis of [[line of succession to the Norwegian throne|unclear succession laws]], which allowed all the king's sons to rule jointly. For periods there could be peace, before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict. The [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings.<ref>Stenersen: 38</ref> The church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts, with the civil wars also becoming an issue regarding the church's influence of the king. The wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of [[H\u00e5kon H\u00e5konsson]], who introduced clear law of succession.<ref>Stenersen: 39</ref>\n\nFrom 1000 to 1300, the population increased from 150,000 to 400,000, resulting both in more land being cleared and the subdivision of farms. While in the Viking Age all farmers owned their own land, by 1300, seventy percent of the land was owned by the king, the church, or the aristocracy. This was a gradual process which took place because of farmers borrowing money in poor times and not being able to repay. However, tenants always remained free men and the large distances and often scattered ownership meant that they enjoyed much more freedom than continental serfs. In the 13th century, about twenty percent of a farmer's yield went to the king, church and landowners.<ref>Stenersen: 37</ref>\n\nThe 14th century is described as Norway's [[Golden Age]], with peace and increase in trade, especially with the British Islands, although Germany became increasingly important towards the end of the century. Throughout the [[High Middle Ages]], the king established Norway as a sovereign state with a central administration and local representatives.<ref>Stenersen: 41</ref>\n\nIn 1349, the [[Black Death]] spread to Norway and had within a year killed a third of the population. Later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by 1400. Many communities were entirely wiped out, resulting in an abundance of land, allowing farmers to switch to more [[animal husbandry]]. The reduction in taxes weakened the king's position,<ref>Stenersen: 44</ref> and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus, reducing some to mere farmers.

''Syttende Mai'' is also called ''Norwegian Constitution Day''.\n\nNorwegian opposition to the great powers' decision to link Norway with Sweden caused the [[Swedish\u2013Norwegian War (1814)|Norwegian\u2013Swedish War]] to break out as Sweden tried to subdue Norway by military means. As Sweden's military was not strong enough to defeat the Norwegian forces outright, and Norway's treasury was not large enough to support a protracted war, and as British and Russian navies blockaded the Norwegian coast,<ref>{{cite book|last = Nicolson|first = Harold|title = The Congress of Vienna; a study in allied unity, 1812\u20131822|publisher = Constable & co. ltd|year = 1946|page =295|quote=The British Government sought to overcome this reluctance by assisting Russia in blockading the coast of Norway}}</ref> the belligerents were forced to negotiate the [[Convention of Moss]]. According to the terms of the convention, Christian Frederik abdicated the Norwegian throne and authorised the [[Parliament of Norway]] to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the [[personal union]] that Norway was forced to accept. On 4 November 1814, the Parliament (Storting) elected [[Charles XIII of Sweden]] as king of Norway, thereby establishing the [[Union between Sweden and Norway|union with Sweden]].<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 572.</ref> Under this arrangement, Norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions, except for the foreign service.

The movement covered all branches of culture, including literature ([[Henrik Wergeland]] [1808\u20131845], [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]] [1832\u20131910], [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]] [1812\u20131845], [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]] [1813\u20131882]), painting ([[Hans Gude]] [1825\u20131903], [[Adolph Tidemand]] [1814\u20131876]), music ([[Edvard Grieg]] [1843\u20131907]), and even language policy, where attempts to define a native written language for Norway led to today's two official written forms for Norwegian: [[Bokm\u00e5l]] and [[Nynorsk]].\n\n[[Charles XIV John of Sweden|King Charles III John]], who came to the throne of Norway and Sweden in 1818, was the second king following Norway's break from Denmark and the union with Sweden. Charles John was a complex man whose long reign extended to 1844. He protected the constitution and liberties of Norway and Sweden during the age of [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Metternich]]. As such, he was regarded as a liberal monarch for that age. However, he was ruthless in his use of paid informers, the secret police and restrictions on the freedom of the press to put down public movements for reform\u2014especially the Norwegian national independence movement.<ref>Franklin D. Scott, ''Sweden: the Nation's History'' ([[University of Minnesota Press]]: Minneapolis, 1977) p. 380.</ref>\n\nThe [[Romanticism|Romantic Era]] that followed the reign of King Charles III John brought some significant social and political reforms. In 1854, women won the right to inherit property in their own right, just like men. In 1863, the last trace of keeping unmarried women in the status of minors was removed. Furthermore, women were then eligible for different occupations, particularly the common school teacher.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 432.</ref> By mid-century, Norway's democracy was limited by modern standards: Voting was limited to officials, property owners, leaseholders and burghers of incorporated towns.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 431.</ref>\n[[File:Saami Family 1900.jpg|thumb|left|A [[S\u00e1mi people|S\u00e1mi]] family in Norway, c. 1900]]\nStill, Norway remained a conservative society.

He made his appeal to the labouring classes urging a change of social structure \"from below upwards.\" In 1848, he organised a labour society in [[Drammen]]. In just a few months, this society had a membership of 500 and was publishing its own newspaper. Within two years, 300 societies had been organised all over Norway, with a total membership of 20,000 persons. The membership was drawn from the lower classes of both urban and rural areas; for the first time these two groups felt they had a common cause.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 433.</ref> In the end, the revolt was easily crushed; Thrane was captured and in 1855, after four years in jail, was sentenced to three additional years for crimes against the safety of the state.

A national referendum confirmed the people's preference for a monarchy over a republic. No Norwegian could legitimately claim the throne because none was able to prove relationship to medieval royalty and in European tradition [[Royal descent|royal]] or \"blue\" blood is a precondition for laying claim to the throne.\n\nThe government offered the throne of Norway to a prince of the Dano-German royal [[house of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl\u00fccksburg]]. Prince Carl of Denmark was unanimously elected king by the Norwegian [[Parliament of Norway|Parliament]], the first king of a fully independent Norway in 508 years (1397: [[Kalmar Union]]); he took the name [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]]. In 1905, the country welcomed the prince from neighbouring Denmark, his wife [[Maud of Wales]] and their young son to re-establish Norway's royal house. Following centuries of close ties between Norway and Denmark, a prince from the latter was the obvious choice for a European prince who could best relate to the Norwegian people.\n\n=== First and Second World Wars ===\n{{See also|German occupation of Norway|Reichskommissariat Norwegen|Quisling regime}}\n[[File:Operation Weser\u00fcbung.jpg|left|thumb|Scenes from the [[Norwegian Campaign]] in 1940]]\n[[File:Bombingen av Kristiansund, 1940, Riksarkivet, Arkivreferanse PA 1667U2 050.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|Bombing of [[Kristiansund]].

In reality, however, Norway had been pressured by the British to hand over increasingly large parts of its large merchant fleet to the British at low rates, as well as to join the trade blockade against Germany. Norwegian merchant marine ships, often with Norwegian sailors still on board, were then sailing under the British flag and at risk of being sunk by German submarines. Thus, many Norwegian sailors and ships were lost. Thereafter, the world ranking of the Norwegian merchant navy fell from fourth place to sixth in the world.<ref>[[#Larsen|Larsen]], p. 510.</ref>\n\nNorway also proclaimed its neutrality during the [[Second World War]], but despite this, it was [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|invaded by German forces]] on 9 April 1940. Although Norway was unprepared for the German surprise attack (see: [[Battle of Dr\u00f8bak Sound]], [[Norwegian Campaign]], and [[Invasion of Norway]]), military and naval resistance lasted for two months. Norwegian armed forces in the north launched an offensive against the German forces in the [[Battles of Narvik]], until they were forced to surrender on 10 June after losing British support which had been diverted to France during the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]].\n\n[[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon]] and the Norwegian government escaped to [[Rotherhithe]] in London. Throughout the war they sent inspirational radio speeches and supported clandestine military actions in Norway against the Germans. On the day of the invasion, the leader of the small National-Socialist party [[Nasjonal Samling]], [[Vidkun Quisling]], tried to seize power, but was forced by the German occupiers to step aside. Real power was wielded by the leader of the German occupation authority, [[Reichskommissar]] [[Josef Terboven]]. Quisling, as ''minister president'', later formed a [[Quisling regime|collaborationist government under German control]]. Up to 15,000 Norwegians volunteered to fight in German units, including the [[Waffen-SS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nuav.net/volunter.html |title=Norwegian volunteers in the Wehrmacht and SS |publisher=Nuav.net |date=9 April 1940 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n[[File:Ole Friele Backer norske flygere.jpg|thumb|left|Norwegian fighter pilots in the United Kingdom during World War II]]\nThe fraction of the Norwegian population that supported Germany was traditionally smaller than in Sweden, but greater than is generally appreciated today.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} It included a number of prominent personalities such as the Nobel-prize winning novelist [[Knut Hamsun]]. The concept of a \"Germanic Union\" of member states fit well into their thoroughly nationalist-patriotic ideology.\n\nMany Norwegians and persons of Norwegian descent joined the Allied forces as well as the [[Free Norwegian Forces]]. In June 1940, a small group had left Norway following their king to Britain. This group included 13 ships, five aircraft, and 500 men from the Royal Norwegian Navy. By the end of the war, the force had grown to 58 ships and 7,500 men in service in the Royal Norwegian Navy, 5 squadrons of aircraft (including Spitfires, Sunderland flying boats and Mosquitos) in the newly formed Norwegian Air Force, and land forces including the [[Norwegian Independent Company 1]] and 5 Troop as well as No. 10 [[British Commandos|Commandos]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nDuring the five years of [[German occupation of Norway|German occupation]], Norwegians built a [[Norwegian resistance movement|resistance movement]] which fought the German occupation forces with both civil disobedience and armed resistance including the destruction of [[Norsk Hydro]]'s [[heavy water]] plant and stockpile of heavy water at [[Vemork]], which crippled the German nuclear programme (see: ''[[Norwegian heavy water sabotage]]''). More important to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, however, was the role of the Norwegian [[Merchant Navy|Merchant Marine]]. At the time of the [[invasion]], Norway had the fourth-largest merchant marine fleet in the world. It was led by the Norwegian shipping company [[Nortraship]] under the Allies throughout the war and took part in every war operation from the [[Dunkirk evacuation|evacuation of Dunkirk]] to the [[Normandy landings]].

The government, led by prime minister [[Einar Gerhardsen]], embarked on a program inspired by [[Keynesian economics]], emphasising state financed industrialisation and co-operation between trade unions and [[employers' organisation]]s. Many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued, although the [[rationing]] of dairy products was lifted in 1949, while price control and rationing of housing and cars continued as long as until 1960.\n[[File:StatfjordA(Jarvin1982).jpg|thumb|Since the 1970s oil production has helped to expand the Norwegian economy and finance the Norwegian state. ([[Statfjord oil field]])]]\nThe wartime alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States was continued in the post-war years. Although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy, the Labour Party distanced itself from the Communists (especially after the Communists' seizure of power in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1948), and strengthened its foreign policy and defence policy ties with the US. Norway received [[Marshall Plan]] aid from the United States starting in 1947, joined the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OEEC) one year later, and became a founding member of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in 1949.\n\nThe first oil was discovered at the small Balder field in 1967, production only began in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.norskolje.museum.no/balder/|title=Balder \u2013 Norsk Oljemuseum|website=www.norskolje.museum.no}}</ref> In 1969, the [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] discovered petroleum resources at the [[Ekofisk oil field|Ekofisk]] field west of Norway. In 1973, the Norwegian government founded the State oil company, [[Statoil]]. Oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s because of the large capital investment that was required to establish the country's petroleum industry. Around 1975, both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked. Since then labour-intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced.\n\nNorway was a founding member of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Norway was twice invited to join the [[European Union]], but ultimately declined to join after referendums that failed by narrow margins in 1972 and 1994.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20830201|title=Norwegian minister Espen Eide urges UK caution on quitting EU |date=23 December 2012 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=23 December 2012}}</ref>\n[[File:2011 Norway attacks flower march 2.jpg|thumb|Town Hall Square in Oslo filled with people with roses mourning the victims of the [[2011 Norway attacks#Ut\u00f8ya massacre|Ut\u00f8ya massacre]], 22 July 2011]]\nIn 1981, a Conservative government led by [[K\u00e5re Willoch]] replaced the Labour Party with a policy of stimulating the [[stagflation|stagflated economy]] with tax cuts, economic liberalisation, deregulation of markets, and measures to curb record-high inflation (13.6% in 1981).\n\nNorway's first female prime minister, [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] of the Labour party, continued many of the reforms of her conservative predecessor, while backing traditional Labour concerns such as [[social security]], high taxes, the industrialisation of nature, and feminism. By the late 1990s, Norway had paid off its foreign debt and had started accumulating a [[sovereign wealth fund]]. Since the 1990s, a divisive question in politics has been how much of the income from petroleum production the government should spend, and how much it should save.\n\nIn 2011, Norway suffered [[2011 Norway attacks|two terrorist attacks]] on the same day conducted by [[Anders Behring Breivik]] which struck the [[Regjeringskvartalet|government quarter]] in Oslo and a summer camp of the Labour party's [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|youth movement]] at [[Ut\u00f8ya]] island, resulting in 77 deaths and 319 wounded.\n\nThe [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013|2013 Norwegian parliamentary election]] brought a more conservative government to power, with the [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]] winning 43% of the electorate's votes.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Norway|Geology of Norway}}\n[[File:Satellite image of Norway in February 2003.jpg|thumb|left|A satellite image of continental Norway in winter]]\nNorway's core territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]]; the remote island of [[Jan Mayen]] and the archipelago of [[Svalbard]] are also part of the Kingdom of Norway.{{refn|The [[Svalbard Treaty|Spitsbergen Treaty]] (also known as the [[Svalbard Treaty]]) of 9 February 1920 recognises Norway's full and absolute sovereignty over the arctic archipelago of Spitsbergen (now called [[Svalbard]]).<ref name=\"Board1986\"/>|group=note}} The Antarctic [[Peter I Island]] and the sub-Antarctic [[Bouvet Island]] are [[Dependencies of Norway|dependent territories]] and thus not considered part of the Kingdom.

[[Finnmarksvidda]] and the interior valleys of [[Troms]] and [[Nordland]] also receive less than {{convert|300|mm|abbr=off}} annually.

Further inland in southeastern and northern Norway, the [[subarctic climate]] (Dfc) dominates; this is especially true for areas in the rain shadow of the [[Scandinavian Mountains]]. Some of the inner valleys of [[Oppland]] get so little precipitation annually, thanks to the rain shadow effect, that they meet the requirements for dry-summer subarctic climates (Dsc). In higher altitudes, close to the coasts of southern and western Norway, one can find the rare subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc). This climate is also common in Northern Norway, but there usually in lower altitudes, all the way down to sea level. A small part of the northernmost coast of Norway has the [[Polar climate|tundra/alpine/polar climate]] (ET). Large parts of Norway are covered by mountains and high altitude plateaus, many of which also exhibit the [[Tundra climate|tundra/alpine/polar climate]] (ET).<ref

It can [[impeachment|impeach]] members of the government if their acts are declared unconstitutional. If an indicted suspect is impeached, Parliament has the power to remove the person from office.\n\nThe position of [[Prime Minister of Norway|prime minister]], Norway's head of government, is allocated to the member of Parliament who can obtain the confidence of a majority in Parliament, usually the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power in terms of the number of seats to form a government on its own. Norway has often been ruled by minority governments.\n\nThe prime minister nominates the cabinet, traditionally drawn from members of the same political party or parties in the Storting, making up the government.

The issue of [[separation of church and state]] in Norway has been increasingly controversial, as many people believe it is time to change this, to reflect the growing diversity in the population. A part of this is the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739.

Norway is a highly integrated member of most sectors of the EU internal market. Some sectors, such as agriculture, oil and fish, are not wholly covered by the EEA Treaty. Norway has also acceded to the [[Schengen Agreement]] and several other intergovernmental agreements among the EU member states.\n\nThe country is richly endowed with natural resources including petroleum, [[hydropower]], fish, [[forestry|forests]], and minerals. Large reserves of petroleum and natural gas were discovered in the 1960s, which led to a boom in the economy. Norway has obtained one of the highest standards of living in the world in part by having a large amount of natural resources compared to the size of the population. In 2011, 28% of state revenues were generated from the petroleum industry.<ref>\"[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3421.htm Norway],\" U.S. Department of State</ref>\n\nNorway is the first country which banned cutting of trees (deforestation), in order to prevent rain forests from vanishing. The country declared its intention at the UN Climate Summit in 2014, alongside Great Britain and Germany. Crops, that are typically linked to forests' destruction are timber, soy, palm oil and beef. Now Norway has to find a new way to provide these essential products without exerting negative influence on its environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/08/europe/norway-deforestation/|title=Norway becomes first country to ban deforestation}}</ref>\n\n=== Resources ===\n[[File:Gaulosen og \u00d8ysand.jpg|thumb|Agriculture is a significant sector, in spite of the mountainous landscape ([[\u00d8ysand]])]]\n[[File:Stockfish in Lofoten.jpg|thumb|right|[[Stockfish]] has been exported from [[Lofoten]] in Norway for at least 1,000 years]]\n;Oil industry\n[[File:Heidrun, Norskehavet (28276260560).jpg|thumb|Oil production has been central to the Norwegian economy since the 1970s, with a dominating [[state ownership]] ([[Heidrun oil field]])]]\nExport revenues from oil and gas have risen to almost 50% of total exports and constitute more than 20% of the GDP.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=[[Statistics Norway]] |chapter-url=http://www.ssb.no/en/befolkning/artikler-og-publikasjoner/this-is-norway/ |title=This is Norway |chapter=Secondary Industries |page=40 |date=15 March 2009 |accessdate=24 March 2013}}</ref> Norway is the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest gas exporter in the world, but it is not a member of [[OPEC]]. In 1995, the Norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund ([[The Government Pension Fund of Norway|\"Government Pension Fund \u2013 Global\"]]), which would be funded with oil revenues, including taxes, dividends, sales revenues and licensing fees. This was intended to reduce overheating in the economy from oil revenues, minimise uncertainty from volatility in oil price, and provide a cushion to compensate for expenses associated with the ageing of the population.\n\nThe government controls its petroleum resources through a combination of state ownership in major operators in the oil fields (with approximately 62% ownership in [[Statoil]] in 2007) and the fully state-owned [[Petoro]], which has a market value of about twice Statoil, and [[State's Direct Financial Interest|SDFI]]. Finally, the government controls licensing of exploration and production of fields. The fund invests in developed financial markets outside Norway. The budgetary rule (''Handlingsregelen'') is to spend no more than 4% of the fund each year (assumed to be the normal yield from the fund).\n\n;Oil fields\nBetween 1966 and 2013, Norwegian companies drilled 5085 oil wells, mostly in the [[North Sea]].<ref name=\"NorwegianSectorOnly?4053wells\">Ole Mathismoen (5 August 2013) ''Aftenposten'' p. 5</ref> Of these 3672 are ''utviklingsbr\u00f8nner'' (regular production);<ref name=\"NorwegianSectorOnly?4053wells\"/> 1413 are ''letebr\u00f8nner'' (exploration); and 1405 have been terminated (''avsluttet'').<ref name=\"NorwegianSectorOnly?4053wells\"/>\n\nOil fields not yet in production phase include: [[Wisting Central]]\u2014calculated size in 2013, 65\u2013156&nbsp;million barrels of oil and {{convert|10|to|40|e9ft3|e9m3|abbr=off}}, (''utvinnbar'') of gas.<ref name=WistingCentral>{{cite web|author=Lindeberg, Anne |url=http://www.dn.no/energi/article2677091.ece |title=Her er Norges nye oljeprovins |publisher=Dn.no |accessdate=12 October 2013|date=6 September 2013 }}</ref> and the [[Castberg Oil Field]] (''Castberg-feltet''<ref name=\"WistingCentral\"/>)\u2014calculated size 540 million barrels of oil, and {{convert|2|to|7|e9ft3|e6m3|abbr=off}} (''utvinnbar'') of gas.<ref name=Castberg-feltet>{{cite web|url=http://www.npd.no/Nyheter/Resultat-av-leteboring/2011/72208-1/ |title=Gass- og oljefunn nord for Sn\u00f8hvitfeltet i Barentshavet \u2013 7220/8-1 |publisher=Npd.no |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref> Both oil fields are located in the [[Barents Sea]].\n\n;Fish industry\nNorway is also the world's second-largest exporter of fish (in value, after China).<ref name=\"GGT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.globefish.org/filedownload.php?fileId=560 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171010164444/http://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/en/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 October 2017 |title=FAO Globefish global trends 2006 |accessdate=8 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=10037949 |title=Mener Norge b\u00f8r satse p\u00e5 v\u00e5pen n\u00e5r oljen tar slutt \u2013 VG Nett om Stoltenberg-regjeringen |publisher=Vg.no |accessdate=7 March 2011}}</ref> Fish from fish farms and catch constitutes the second largest (behind oil/natural gas) export product measured in value.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dokumenter/norsk-naringsvirksomhet---strukturen-i-n/id87547/#Sentrale|title=Norsk n\u00e6ringsvirksomhet - Strukturen i norsk \u00f8konomi|last=handelsdepartementet|first=N\u00e6rings- og|date=18 May 2000|website=Regjeringen.no|language=no|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ssb.no/nasjonalregnskap-og-konjunkturer/faktaside/norsk-naeringsliv|title=Norsk n\u00e6ringsliv|work=ssb.no|access-date=3 October 2018|language=nb-NO}}</ref>\n\n;Electricity\n[[hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric plants]] generate roughly 98\u201399% of Norway's electric power, more than any other country in the world.<ref>{{cite news|title=Binge and purge |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12970769 |quote=98\u201399% of Norway's electricity comes from hydroelectric plants. |work=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=30 January 2009 |date=22 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n;Mineral resources\nNorway contains significant mineral resources, and in 2013, its mineral production was valued at US$1.5&nbsp;billion (Norwegian Geological Survey data).

In this way, the losses incurred by the market turmoil was recuperated by November 2009.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nOther nations with economies based on natural resources, such as Russia, are trying to learn from Norway by establishing similar funds.

The next year, the main telecom supplier, [[Telenor]], was listed on [[Oslo Stock Exchange]]. The state also owns significant shares of Norway's largest bank, [[DNB ASA|DnB NOR]] and the airline [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]. Since 2000, economic growth has been rapid, pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the early 1980s (unemployment in 2007: 1.3%). The international financial crisis has primarily affected the industrial sector, but unemployment has remained low, and was at 3.3% (86,000 people) in August 2011. In contrast to Norway, Sweden had substantially higher actual and projected unemployment numbers as a result of the recession. Thousands of mainly young Swedes migrated to Norway for work during these years, which is easy, as the labour market and social security systems overlap in the Nordic Countries.

The Norwegian government offers language instructional courses for immigrants wishing to obtain Norwegian citizenship. With increasing concern about assimilating immigrants, since 1 September 2008, the government has required that an applicant for Norwegian citizenship give evidence of proficiency in either Norwegian or in one of the S\u00e1mi languages, or give proof of having attended classes in Norwegian for 300 hours, or meet the language requirements for university studies in Norway (that is, by being proficient in one of the Scandinavian languages).\n\nThe primary foreign language taught in Norwegian schools is English, considered an international language since the post-WWII era. The majority of the population is fairly fluent in English, especially those born after World War II. German, French and Spanish are also commonly taught as second or, more often, third languages. Russian, Japanese, Italian, [[Latin]], and rarely [[Standard Mandarin|Chinese (Mandarin)]] are offered in some schools, mostly in the cities. Traditionally, English, German and French were considered the main foreign languages in Norway. These languages, for instance, were used on [[Norwegian passport]]s until the 1990s, and university students have a general right to use these languages when submitting their theses.\n\n=== Population ===\n{{Historical populations\n|percentages = pagr\n|footnote = '''Source''': Statistics Norway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/02/02/folkendrhist/tabeller/tab/00.html |title=Tabell 0 Hele landet.

Controversial events associated with the black metal movement in the early 1990s included several [[Church arson|church burnings]] and two prominent [[Black metal#Aarseth's murder|murder cases]].\n\nThe jazz scene in Norway is thriving.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the group maintained its popularity domestically, and has remained successful outside Norway, especially in Germany, Switzerland, France, and Brazil.\n\nSome of the most memorable female solo artists from Norway are [[Susanne Sundf\u00f8r]], [[Astrid S]], [[Adel\u00e9n]], [[Julie Bergan]], [[Maria Mena]], [[Tone Damli]], [[Margaret Berger]], [[Lene Marlin]], [[Christel Alsos]], [[Maria Arredondo]], [[Marion Raven]], [[Marit Larsen]]; both former members of the defunct pop-rock group [[M2M (band)|M2M]], [[Lene Nystr\u00f8m]] vocalist of the Danish eurodance group [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], and [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] vocalist of the Swedish pop group [[ABBA]].\n\nIn recent years, various Norwegian songwriters and production teams have contributed to the music of other international artists. The Norwegian production team [[Stargate (production team)|Stargate]] has produced songs for [[Rihanna]], [[Beyonc\u00e9]], [[Shakira]], [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Lionel Richie]], among others. [[Espen Lind]] has written and produced songs for Beyonc\u00e9, Lionel Richie and [[Leona Lewis]], among others. [[Lene Marlin]] has written songs for Rihanna and [[Lovebugs (band)|Lovebugs]]. [[Ina Wroldsen]] has written songs for artists such as [[Demi Lovato]], [[Shakira]], [[Inna]], [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]], [[One Direction]] and [[The Saturdays]] among others.\n\nNorway enjoys many music festivals throughout the year, all over the country. Norway is the host of one of the world's biggest [[extreme sport]] festivals with music, [[Ekstremsportveko]]\u2014a festival held annually in [[Voss]]. Oslo is the host of many festivals, such as [[\u00d8yafestivalen]] and [[by:Larm]]. Oslo used to have a summer parade similar to the German [[Love Parade]]. In 1992, the city of Oslo wanted to adopt the French music festival ''F\u00eate de la Musique''. [[Fredrik Carl St\u00f8rmer]] established the festival. Even in its first year, \"Musikkens Dag\" gathered thousands of people and artists in the streets of Oslo. \"Musikkens Dag\" is now renamed ''Musikkfest Oslo''.\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Norwegian literature}}\n{{See also|List of Norwegian writers}}\n[[File:Hamsun bldsa HA0269.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Knut Hamsun]], author]]\nThe history of Norwegian literature starts with the [[Norse paganism|pagan]] [[Poetic Edda|Eddaic poems]] and [[skald]]ic verse of the 9th and 10th centuries, with poets such as [[Bragi Boddason]] and [[Eyvindr sk\u00e1ldaspillir]]. The arrival of Christianity around the year 1000 brought Norway into contact with European mediaeval learning, [[hagiography]] and history writing. Merged with native oral tradition and Icelandic influence, this influenced the literature written in the late 12th and early 13th centuries. Major works of that period include ''[[Historia Norwegi\u00e6]]'', ''[[\u00dei\u00f0rekssaga]]'' and ''[[Konungs skuggsj\u00e1]]''.\n\nLittle Norwegian literature came out of the period of the Scandinavian Union and the subsequent Dano-Norwegian union (1387\u20131814), with some notable exceptions such as [[Petter Dass]] and [[Ludvig Holberg]]. In his play ''[[Peer Gynt]]'', Ibsen characterised this period as \"Twice two hundred years of darkness/brooded o'er the race of monkeys.\" The first line of this couplet is frequently quoted. During the union with Denmark, the government imposed using only written Danish, which decreased the writing of Norwegian literature.\n[[File:Ibsen photography.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henrik Ibsen]]]]\nTwo major events precipitated a major resurgence in Norwegian literature: in 1811 a Norwegian university was established in [[Oslo|Christiania]]. Secondly, seized by the spirit of revolution following the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions, the Norwegians created their first [[Constitution of Norway|Constitution]] in 1814. Strong authors were inspired who became recognised first in Scandinavia, and then worldwide; among them were [[Henrik Wergeland]], [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]], [[J\u00f8rgen Moe]] and [[Camilla Collett]].\n\nBy the late 19th century, in the [[Golden Age]] of Norwegian literature, the so-called \"Great Four\" emerged: [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]], [[Alexander Kielland]], and [[Jonas Lie (writer)|Jonas Lie]]. Bj\u00f8rnson's \"peasant novels\", such as ''Ein glad gut'' (A Happy Boy) and ''Synn\u00f8ve Solbakken'', are typical of the [[Norwegian romantic nationalism]] of their day. Kielland's novels and short stories are mostly naturalistic. Although an important contributor to early romantic nationalism, (especially ''[[Peer Gynt]]''), [[Henrik Ibsen]] is better known for his pioneering realistic dramas such as ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' and ''[[A Doll's House]].'' They caused an uproar because of his candid portrayals of the middle classes, complete with infidelity, unhappy marriages, and corrupt businessmen.\n\nIn the 20th century, three Norwegian novelists were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]: [[Bj\u00f8rnstjerne Bj\u00f8rnson]] in 1903, [[Knut Hamsun]] for the book ''[[Growth of the Soil|Markens gr\u00f8de]]'' (\"Growth of the Soil\") in 1920, and [[Sigrid Undset]] (known for ''[[Kristin Lavransdatter|Kristinlavransdatter]]'') in 1928. Writers such as the following also made important contributions: [[Dag Solstad]], [[Jon Fosse]], [[Cora Sandel]], [[Olav Duun]], [[Olav H. Hauge]], [[Gunvor Hofmo]], [[Stein Mehren]], [[Kjell Askildsen]], [[Hans Herbj\u00f8rnsrud]], [[Aksel Sandemose]], [[Bergljot Hob\u00e6k Haff]], [[Jostein Gaarder]], [[Erik Fosnes Hansen]], [[Jens Bj\u00f8rneboe]], [[Kjartan Fl\u00f8gstad]], [[Lars Saabye Christensen]], [[Johan Borgen]], [[Herbj\u00f8rg Wassmo]], [[Jan Erik Vold]], [[Rolf Jacobsen (poet)|Rolf Jacobsen]], [[Olaf Bull]], [[Jan Kj\u00e6rstad]], [[Georg Johannesen]], [[Tarjei Vesaas]], [[Sigurd Hoel]], [[Arnulf \u00d8verland]], [[Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd]] and [[Johan Falkberget]].\n\n=== Research ===\nInternationally recognised Norwegian scientists include the mathematicians [[Niels Henrik Abel]], [[Sophus Lie]] and [[Atle Selberg]], physical chemist [[Lars Onsager]], physicist [[Ivar Giaever]], chemists [[Odd Hassel]], [[Peter Waage]], and [[Cato Maximilian Guldberg]].\n\nIn the 20th century, Norwegian academics have been pioneering in many [[social sciences]], including [[criminology]], sociology and [[peace and conflict studies]]. Prominent academics include [[Arne N\u00e6ss]], a philosopher and founder of [[deep ecology]]; [[Johan Galtung]], the founder of [[peace studies]]; [[Nils Christie]] and [[Thomas Mathiesen]], criminologists; [[Fredrik Barth]], a social anthropologist; [[Vilhelm Aubert]], [[Harriet Holter]] and [[Erik Gr\u00f8nseth]], sociologists; [[Tove Stang Dahl]], a pioneer of women's law; [[Stein Rokkan]], a political scientist; and economists [[Ragnar Frisch]], [[Trygve Haavelmo]], and [[Finn E. Kydland]].\n\nIn 2014, the two Norwegian scientists [[May-Britt Moser]] and [[Edvard Moser]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] along with [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]]. They won the prize for their groundbreaking work identifying the cells that make up a positioning system in the human brain, our \"in-built GPS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiologi or Medicine 2014 |publisher=The Official Website of the Nobel Prize |accessdate=2 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Architecture of Norway}}\n[[File:Urnesstavkirke.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|The [[Urnes Stave Church]] has been listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].]]\nWith expansive forests, Norway has long had a tradition of building in wood.

Stonework architecture was introduced from Europe for the most important structures, beginning with the construction of [[Nidaros Cathedral]] in [[Trondheim]]. In the early [[Middle Ages]], wooden [[stave church]]es were constructed throughout Norway. Some of them have survived; they represent Norway's most unusual contribution to architectural history. A fine example, [[Urnes Stave Church]] in inner [[Sognefjord]], is on [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage List]]. Another notable example of wooden architecture is the buildings at [[Bryggen]] Wharf in Bergen, also on the list for World Cultural Heritage sites, consisting of a row of tall, narrow wooden structures along the quayside.\n[[File:Hyttklokka.jpg|thumb|upright|The 17th-century town of [[R\u00f8ros]], designated in 1980 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has narrow streets and wooden houses.]]\nIn the 17th century, under the Danish monarchy, cities and villages such as [[Kongsberg]] and [[R\u00f8ros]] were established. The city Kongsberg had a church built in the Baroque style. Traditional wooden buildings that were constructed in R\u00f8ros have survived.\n\nAfter Norway's union with Denmark was dissolved in 1814, Oslo became the capital. The architect [[Christian Heinrich Grosch|Christian H. Grosch]] designed the earliest parts of the [[University of Oslo]], the [[Oslo Stock Exchange]], and many other buildings and churches constructed in that early national period.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the city of [[\u00c5lesund]] was rebuilt in the [[Art Nouveau]] style, influenced by styles of France. The 1930s, when functionalism dominated, became a strong period for Norwegian architecture. It is only since the late 20th century that Norwegian architects have achieved international renown. One of the most striking modern buildings in Norway is the [[S\u00e1mi Parliament of Norway|S\u00e1mi Parliament]] in [[Karasjok|K\u00e1r\u00e1\u0161johka]], designed by [[Stein Halvorson]] and [[Christian Sundby]].

It was in the 19th century that a truly Norwegian era began, first with portraits, later with impressive landscapes. Johan Christian Dahl (1788\u20131857), originally from the Dresden school, eventually returned to paint the landscapes of western Norway, defining Norwegian painting for the first time.\"<ref name=\"HFG\">{{cite book |author= Haverkamp, Frode |title = Hans Fredrik Gude: From National Romanticism to Realism in Landscape |language = Norwegian}}</ref>\n\nNorway's newly found independence from Denmark encouraged painters to develop their Norwegian identity, especially with landscape painting by artists such as [[Kitty Lange Kielland|Kitty Kielland]], a female painter who studied under [[Hans Gude]], and [[Harriet Backer]], another pioneer among female artists, influenced by [[impressionism]]. [[Frits Thaulow]], an impressionist, was influenced by the art scene in Paris as was [[Christian Krohg]], a realist painter, famous for his paintings of prostitutes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artcyclopedia.com/nationalities/Norwegian.html |title=Norwegian Artists |publisher=Artcyclopedia.com |accessdate=23 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nOf particular note is [[Edvard Munch]], a symbolist/expressionist painter who became world-famous for ''[[The Scream]]'' which is said to represent the anxiety of modern man.\n\nOther artists of note include [[Harald Sohlberg]], a neo-romantic painter remembered for his paintings of [[R\u00f8ros]], and [[Odd Nerdrum]], a figurative painter who maintains that his work is not art, but [[kitsch]].\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Norwegian cuisine}}\n[[:Category:Norwegian cuisine|Norway's culinary traditions]] show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions, with [[salmon]] (fresh and cured), [[herring]] (pickled or marinated), [[trout]], [[cod]]fish, and other seafood, balanced by cheeses (such as [[brunost]]), dairy products, and breads (predominantly dark/darker).\n\n[[Lefse]] is a Norwegian potato flatbread, usually topped with large amounts of butter and sugar, most common around Christmas.

It is the eleventh largest [[sovereign state]] in [[Africa]] and is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west, [[Western Sahara]] to the north and northwest, [[Algeria]] to the northeast, [[Mali]] to the east and southeast, and [[Senegal]] to the southwest.\n\nThe country derives its name from the ancient [[Berbers|Berber]] kingdom of [[Mauretania]], which existed from the 3rd century BCE into the 7th century CE in the far north of modern-day [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]. Approximately 90% of Mauritania's land is within the [[Sahara]]; consequently, the population is concentrated in the south, where precipitation is slightly higher. The capital and largest city is [[Nouakchott]], located on the Atlantic coast, which is home to around one-third of the country's {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Mauritania}}|,||}}/1e6 round 1}} million people. The government was overthrown on 6 August 2008, in [[2008 Mauritanian coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by General [[Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz]]. On 16 April 2009, Aziz resigned from the military to run for president in the 19 July elections, which he won.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/world/africa/20mauritania.html?_r=0|title=Coup Leader Wins Election Amid Outcry in Mauritania|agency=[[Associated Press]] (AP)|work= [[The New York Times]]|date=19 July 2009|location= Nouakchott, Mauritania |accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Names and pronunciation==\n\nMauritania ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Mauritania.ogg|\u02cc|m|\u0252r|\u026a|\u02c8|t|e\u026a|n|i|\u0259|,_|\u02cc|m|\u0254\u02d0r|\u026a|-}};<ref>{{citation|last=Wells|first=John  C.|year=2008|title=Longman Pronunciation Dictionary|edition=3rd|publisher=Longman|isbn=9781405881180}}</ref> ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0648\u0631\u064a\u062a\u0627\u0646\u064a\u0627}}, ''{{transl|ar|M\u016br\u012bt\u0101ny\u0101}}'', {{lang-fr|Mauritanie}}) is officially known as the '''Islamic Republic of Mauritania'''.

Through a combination of strategic alliances with [[Zawaya tribe|Zawaya]] tribes, and military pressure on the Hassane warrior nomads, he managed to extend French rule over the Mauritanian [[emirate]]s. [[Emirate of Trarza|Trarza]], [[Brakna]] and [[Tagant Region|Tagant]] were occupied by the French armies in 1903\u201304, but the northern emirate of [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] held out longer, aided by the anti-colonial rebellion (or [[jihad]]) of shaykh [[Maa al-Aynayn]], as well by insurgents from Tagant and the other regions. Adrar was finally defeated militarily in 1912, and incorporated into the territory of Mauritania, which had been drawn up and planned in 1904. Mauritania was part of [[French West Africa]] from 1920, as a [[protectorate]] and, then, a [[colony]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/world/mauritania-history.html|title=Mauritania: History|website=www.infoplease.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}</ref>\n\nFrench rule brought legal prohibitions against slavery and an end to inter-clan warfare.

The previous capital of the country under the French rule, [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], was located in Senegal, so when the country gained independence in 1960, Nouakchott, at the time little more than a fortified village (''\"ksar\"''), was chosen as the site of the  new capital of Mauritania.<ref name=\"Pazzanita2008\">{{cite book|author=Pazzanita, Anthony G. |title=Historical Dictionary of Mauritania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KU_9MfXKKYC&pg=PA369|year=2008|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-6265-4}} page 369.</ref>\n\nAfter gaining independence, larger numbers of indigenous [[Sub-Saharan African]] peoples ([[Fula people|Haalpulaar]], [[Soninke people|Soninke]], and [[Wolof people|Wolof]]) entered Mauritania, moving into the area north of the [[Senegal River]].

This occurred as the French militarily suppressed the most intransigent Hassane tribes in the north.

The Arabized dominant elites reacted to changing circumstances, and to [[Arab nationalist]] calls from abroad, by increasing pressure to [[Arabization|Arabize]] many aspects of Mauritanian life, such as law and the education system. This was also a reaction to the consequences of the French domination under the colonial rule. Various models for maintaining the country's cultural diversity have been suggested, but none were successfully implemented.\n\nThis ethnic discord was evident during inter-communal violence that broke out in April 1989 (the \"[[Mauritania\u2013Senegal Border War]]\"), but has since subsided. Mauritania expelled some 70,000 sub-Saharan African Mauritanians in the late 1980s.<ref>[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?ReportId=70522 MAURITANIA: Fair elections haunted by racial imbalance], IRIN News. 5 March 2007.</ref> Ethnic tensions and the sensitive issue of slavery \u2013&nbsp;past and, in some areas, present&nbsp;\u2013 are still powerful themes in the country's political debate.

After several military losses from the [[Polisario]] \u2013&nbsp;heavily armed and supported by Algeria, the [[regional power]] and rival to Morocco&nbsp;\u2013 Mauritania withdrew in 1979. Its claims were taken over by Morocco.\n\nDue to economic weakness, Mauritania has been a negligible player in the territorial dispute, with its official position being that it wishes for an expedient solution that is mutually agreeable to all parties. While most of Western Sahara has been occupied by Morocco, the UN still considers the Western Sahara a territory that needs to express its wishes with respect to statehood. A referendum is still supposed to be held sometime in the future, under UN auspices, to determine whether or not the indigenous [[Sahrawis]] wish to be independent, as the [[Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic]], or to be part of Morocco.\n\n===Ould Daddah era (1960\u20131978)===\n{{Main|Constitution of Mauritania|Mauritanian People's Party|Moktar Ould Daddah}}\n<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->\nMauritania became an independent nation in November 1960.<ref>{{citation|first= Martin |last= Meredith |title= The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence|publisher= Public Affairs Publishing|location= New York|year= 2005|page= 69|isbn=978-1610390712}}</ref> In 1964 [[President of Mauritania|President]] [[Moktar Ould Daddah]], originally installed by the French, formalized Mauritania as a [[one-party state]] with a new [[Constitution of Mauritania|constitution]], setting up an [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] presidential regime. Daddah's own [[Parti du Peuple Mauritanien]] (PPM) became the ruling organization in a [[One-party state|one-party system]]. The President justified this on the grounds that Mauritania was not ready for western-style [[multi-party system|multi-party democracy]]. Under this one-party constitution, Daddah was reelected in uncontested elections in 1976 and 1978.\n\nHe was ousted in a [[Military Committee for National Recovery|bloodless coup]] on 10 July 1978. He had brought the country to near-collapse through a disastrous [[History of Western Sahara|war]] to [[annexation|annex]] the [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|southern part]] of [[Western Sahara]], framed as an attempt to create a \"[[Greater Mauritania]]\".\n\n===CMRN and CMSN military governments (1978\u20131984)===\n[[File:Chinguetti-Guide.JPG|thumb|[[Chinguetti]] was a center of Islamic scholarship in West Africa.]]\n[[Col.]] [[Mustafa Ould Salek]]'s [[CMRN]] [[military junta|''junta'']] proved incapable of either establishing a strong base of power or extracting the country from its destabilizing conflict with the [[Western Sahara|Sahrawi]] resistance movement, the [[Polisario Front]]. It quickly fell, to be replaced by another military government, the [[Military Committee for National Salvation|CMSN]].\n\nThe energetic Colonel [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidallah]] soon emerged as its strongman. By giving up all claims to Western Sahara, he found peace with the Polisario and improved relations with its main backer, Algeria. But relations with Morocco, the other party to the conflict, and its European ally France deteriorated. Instability continued, and Haidallah's ambitious reform attempts foundered. His regime was plagued by attempted coups and intrigue within the military establishment. It became increasingly contested due to his harsh and uncompromising measures against opponents; many dissidents were jailed, and some executed. In 1981 slavery was formally abolished by law, making Mauritania the last country in the world to do so.\n\n===Ould Taya's rule (1984\u20132005)===\nIn December 1984, Haidallah was deposed by Colonel [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]], who, while retaining tight military control, relaxed the political climate. Ould Taya moderated Mauritania's previous pro-Algerian stance, and re-established ties with Morocco during the late 1980s. He deepened these ties during the late 1990s and early 2000s as part of Mauritania's drive to attract support from Western states and Western-aligned Arab states. Mauritania has not rescinded its recognition of Polisario's Western Saharan exile government, and remains on good terms with Algeria. Its position on the Western Sahara conflict is, since the 1980s, one of strict neutrality.\n\nOrdinance 83.127, enacted 5 June 1983, started the process of nationalization of all land not clearly the property of a documented owner, thus abolishing the traditional system of land tenure.

The opposition participated in municipal elections in January\u2013February 1994, and in subsequent [[Senate]] elections \u2013 most recently in April 2004 \u2013 and gained representation at the local level, as well as three seats in the Senate.\n\nThis period was marked by extensive ethnic violence and [[Human rights in Mauritania|human rights abuses]].

During the mid-to late 1990s, Mauritania shifted its foreign policy to one of increased co-operation with the US and Europe. It was rewarded with diplomatic normalization and aid projects. On 28 October 1999, Mauritania joined Egypt, Palestine, and Jordan as the only members of the Arab League to officially recognize Israel.

The leaders of the attempted coup escaped from the country, but some of them were caught, later on. Mauritania's [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2003|presidential election]], its third since adopting the democratic process in 1992, took place on 7 November 2003. Six candidates, including Mauritania's first female and first Haratine (descended from former [[Slavery in Mauritania|slaves]]) candidates, represented a wide variety of political goals and backgrounds. Incumbent President [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]] won reelection with 67.0% of the popular vote, according to the official figures, with [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla]] finishing second.\n\n===August 2005 military coup===\n<!--Please add new information to relevant articles of the series-->\nOn 3 August 2005, a military coup led by Colonel [[Ely Ould Mohamed Vall]] ended Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya's twenty-one years of rule. Taking advantage of Taya's attendance at the funeral of [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] [[King Fahd]], the military, including members of the presidential guard, seized control of key points in the capital [[Nouakchott]]. The coup proceeded without loss of life. Calling themselves the Military Council for Justice and Democracy, the officers released the following statement:\n\n:\"The national armed forces and security forces have unanimously decided to put a definitive end to the oppressive activities of the defunct authority, which our people have suffered from during the past years.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4741243.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Mauritania officers 'seize power' |date=4 August 2005 |accessdate=6 August 2008}}</ref>\n\nThe Military Council later issued another statement naming Colonel Vall as president and director of the national police force, the ''S\u00fbret\u00e9 Nationale''. Vall, once regarded as a firm ally of the now-ousted president, had aided Taya in the coup that had originally brought him to power, and had later served as his security chief. Sixteen other officers were listed as members of the Council.\n\nThough cautiously watched by the international community, the coup came to be generally accepted, with the military ''junta'' organizing elections within a promised two-year timeline. In a [[referendum]] on 26 June 2006, Mauritanians overwhelmingly (97%) approved a new constitution which limited the duration of a president's stay in office. The leader of the ''junta'', Col. Vall, promised to abide by the referendum and relinquish power peacefully. Mauritania's establishment of relations with [[Israel]]{{spaced ndash}}it is one of only three Arab states to recognize Israel{{spaced ndash}}was maintained by the new regime, despite widespread criticism from the opposition.

It found few supporters (among them Morocco, Libya and Iran), while Algeria, the United States, France and other European countries criticized the coup, and continued to refer to Abdallahi as the legitimate president of Mauritania. Domestically, a group of parties coalesced around Abdallahi to continue protesting the coup, which caused the junta to ban demonstrations and crack down on opposition activists. International and internal pressure eventually forced the release of Abdallahi, who was instead placed under house arrest in his home village. The new government broke off relations with Israel. In March 2010, Mauritania's female foreign minister Mint Hamdi Ould Mouknass announced that Mauritania had cut ties with Israel in a \"complete and definitive way.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/middle-east/Mauritania-Affirms-Break-with-Israel-88763857.html |title=Mauritania Affirms Break with Israel |publisher=Voice of America News |date=21 March 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the coup, Abdel Aziz insisted on holding new presidential elections to replace Abdallahi, but was forced to reschedule them due to internal and international opposition. During the spring of 2009, the [[Military junta|junta]] negotiated an understanding with some opposition figures and international parties. As a result, Abdallahi formally resigned under protest, as it became clear that some opposition forces had defected from him and most international players, notably including France and Algeria, now aligned with Abdel Aziz. The United States continued to criticize the coup, but did not actively oppose the elections.\n\nAbdallahi's resignation allowed the [[Mauritanian presidential election, 2009|election]] of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority. Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. They argued that the election had been falsified due to junta control, and complained that the international community had let down the opposition. Despite complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with Mauritania. By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and internal support. Some figures, such as Senate chairman [[Messaoud Ould Boulkheir]], continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.\n\nIn February 2011, the waves of the [[Arab Spring]] [[2011\u20132013 Mauritanian protests|spread to Mauritania]], where thousands of people took to the streets of the capital.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/feb/25/gaddafi-libya-live-blog |location=London |work=The Guardian |first= Richard |last= Adams |title=Libya's turmoil |date=25 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2014, Mauritania was invited as a non-member guest nation to the G20 summit in Brisbane.\n\n== Society ==\n=== Demographics ===\n{{Main|Demographics of Mauritania}}\n[[File:Adrar-Mother&daughter.JPG|thumb|A [[Moors|Moorish]] family in the [[Adrar Region|Adrar Plateau]].]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|0.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|2.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}} ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Mauritania}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|}\n{{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}}}, Mauritania had a population of approximately 4.3 million.

A series of scarps face southwest, longitudinally bisecting these plains in the center of the country. The scarps also separate a series of sandstone plateaus, the highest of which is the [[Adrar Plateau]], reaching an elevation of 500 metres. <ref name=\"Hughes1992\">{{cite book|author=R. H.

Isolated peaks, often rich in minerals, rise above the plateaus; the smaller peaks are called guelbs and the larger ones kedias. The concentric [[Guelb er Richat]] is a prominent feature of the north-central region. [[Kediet ej Jill]], near the city of [[Zou\u00eer\u00e2t]], has an elevation of 1,000 metres and is the highest peak.\n\nApproximately three-quarters of Mauritania is desert or semidesert.<ref name=\"Wane2009\">{{cite book|author=Njoki N.

The plateaus gradually descend toward the northeast to the barren [[El Djouf]], or \"Empty Quarter,\" a vast region of large sand dunes that merges into the [[Sahara Desert]]. To the west, between the ocean and the plateaus, are alternating areas of clayey plains (regs) and sand dunes (ergs), some of which shift from place to place, gradually moved by high winds. The dunes generally increase in size and mobility toward the north.\n\nBelts of natural vegetation, corresponding to the rainfall pattern, extend from east to west and range from traces of tropical forest along the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]] to brush and savanna in the southeast. Only sandy desert is found in the centre and north of the country.\n\n== Economy ==\n{{main|Economy of Mauritania|Transport in Mauritania}}\n[[File:Mauritania treemap.png|thumb|Graphical depiction of Mauritania's product exports in 28 color-coded categories]]\n\nDespite being rich in natural resources, Mauritania has a low GDP.<ref name=\"Dept.2015\">{{cite book|author=International Monetary Fund.

Gold and copper mining companies are opening mines in the interior.\n\nThe country's first [[deepwater port]] opened near [[Nouakchott]] in 1986. In recent years, drought and economic mismanagement have resulted in a buildup of foreign debt. In March 1999, the government signed an agreement with a joint [[World Bank]]-[[International Monetary Fund]] mission on a $54&nbsp;million enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF). Privatization remains one of the key issues. Mauritania is unlikely to meet ESAF's annual GDP growth objectives of 4\u20135%.\n\n[[Petroleum|Oil]] was discovered in Mauritania in 2001 in the offshore [[Chinguetti field]].

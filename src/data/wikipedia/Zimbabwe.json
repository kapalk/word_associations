The state endured international isolation and a 15-year [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] with [[black nationalist]] forces; this culminated in a [[Lancaster House Agreement|peace agreement]] that established universal enfranchisement and ''[[de jure]]'' sovereignty as Zimbabwe in April 1980. Zimbabwe then joined the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], from which it was suspended in 2002 for breaches of international law by its then-government, and from which it withdrew in December 2003. The [[sovereign state]] is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[African Union]] (AU), and the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA).

The Zimbabwean plateau eventually became the centre of subsequent Shona states, beginning around the 10th century. Around the early 10th century, trade developed with [[Shirazi era|Arab merchants]] on the Indian Ocean coast, helping to develop the [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]] in the 11th century. This was the precursor to the more impressive Shona civilisations that would dominate the region during the 13th to 15th centuries, evidenced by ruins at [[Great Zimbabwe]], near [[Masvingo]], and by other smaller sites.

This Shona state further refined and expanded upon Mapungubwe's stone architecture, which survives to this day at the ruins of the kingdom's capital of Great Zimbabwe. From {{circa}} 1450 to 1760 Zimbabwe gave way to the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. This Shona state ruled much of the area of present-day Zimbabwe, plus parts of central [[Mozambique]]. It is known by many names including the [[Mutapa Empire]], also known as ''Mwene Mutapa'' or ''Monomotapa'' as well as \"Munhumutapa\", and was renowned for its strategic trade routes with the [[Arabs]] and Portugal. The Portuguese sought to monopolise this influence and began a series of wars which left the empire in near collapse in the early 17th century.<ref name=\"autogenerated241\"/>\n\nAs a direct response to increased [[Europe]]an presence in the interior a new Shona state emerged, known as the [[Rozwi Empire]] (1684\u20131834). Relying on centuries of military, political and religious development, the Rozwi (meaning \"destroyers\") expelled the Portuguese from the Zimbabwean plateau{{when|date=November 2018}} by force of arms.

The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]], leaving a trail of destruction in their wake and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the [[Mfecane]]. When [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Boers|trekboers]] converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward, with the assistance of [[Tswana people|Tswana]] [[Barolong]] warriors and [[Griqua people|Griqua]] [[commando]]s.

Mzilikazi then organised his society into a military system with regimental [[kraal]]s, similar to those of Shaka, which was stable enough to repel further Boer incursions. Mzilikazi died in 1868; following a violent power struggle, his son [[Lobengula]] succeeded him.\n\n===Colonial era and Rhodesia (1888\u20131964)===\n{{Main|Company rule in Rhodesia|Southern Rhodesia|Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland}}\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2016}}\n[[File:Matabeleland.png|thumb|right|[[Matabeleland]] in the 19th century.]]\nIn the 1880s, European colonists arrived with [[Cecil Rhodes]]'s [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC).

ZAPU was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], the [[Warsaw Pact]] and associated nations such as Cuba, and adopted a [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist]] ideology; ZANU meanwhile aligned itself with [[Maoism]] and the bloc headed by the People's Republic of China. Smith declared Rhodesia a republic in 1970, following the results of a [[Rhodesian constitutional referendum, 1969|referendum]] the previous year, but this went unrecognised internationally.

If this rate of growth had been maintained for the next 37 years, Zimbabwe  would have in 2016 a GDP of US$52 billion. Instead it had a formal sector GDP of only US$14 billion, a cost of US$38 billion in lost growth. The population growth in 1980 was among the highest in Africa at about 3,5 per cent per annum, doubling every 21 years. Had this growth been maintained, the population would have been 31 million. Instead, as of 2018, it is about 13 million. The discrepancies were believed to be partly caused by death from starvation and disease, and partly due to decreased fertility. The life expectancy has halved, and death from politically motivated violence sponsored by government exceeds 200,000 since 1980.

Its northwest corner is roughly 150 meters from [[Namibia]], nearly forming a four-nation [[quadripoint]]. Most of the country is elevated, consisting of a central plateau (high veld) stretching from the southwest northwards with altitudes between 1,000 and 1,600 m.

For instance, it lacks the critical mass of researchers needed to trigger innovation. Although the infrastructure is in place to harness research and development to Zimbabwe's socio-economic development, universities and research institutions lack the financial and human resources to conduct research and the regulatory environment hampers the transfer of new technologies to the business sector. The economic crisis has precipitated an exodus of university students and professionals in key areas of expertise (medicine, engineering, etc.) that is of growing concern. More than 22% of Zimbabwean tertiary students were completing their degrees abroad in 2012, compared to a 4% average for sub-Saharan Africa as a whole. In 2012, there were 200 researchers (head count) employed in the public sector, one-quarter of whom were women. This is double the continental average (91 in 2013) but only one-quarter the researcher density of South Africa (818 per million inhabitants). The government has created the Zimbabwe Human Capital Website to provide information for the diaspora on job and investment opportunities in Zimbabwe.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nDespite the fact that human resources are a pillar of any research and innovation policy, the ''Medium Term Plan'' ''2011\u20132015'' did not discuss any explicit policy for promoting postgraduate studies in science and engineering. The scarcity of new PhDs in science and engineering fields from the University of Zimbabwe in 2013 was symptomatic of this omission.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nNor does the development agenda to 2018, the ''Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable Economic Transformation,'' contain any specific targets for increasing the number of scientists and engineers, or the staffing requirements for industry and other productive sectors. In addition, the lack of co-ordination and coherence among governance structures has led to a multiplication of research priorities and poor implementation of existing policies.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Scientific_publication_trends_in_SADC_countries,_2005-2014.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Scientific_publication_trends_in_SADC_countries,_2005-2014.svg|thumb|Scientific publication trends in the most productive SADC countries, 2005\u20132014.

It replaces the earlier policy dating from 2002. The 2012 policy prioritizes biotechnology, information and communication technologies (ICTs), space sciences, nanotechnology, indigenous knowledge systems, technologies yet to emerge and scientific solutions to emergent environmental challenges. The ''Second Science and Technology Policy'' also asserts the government commitment to allocating at least 1% of GDP to research and development, focusing at least 60% of university education on developing skills in science and technology and ensuring that school pupils devote at least 30% of their time to studying science subjects.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 2014, Zimbabwe counted 21 publications per million inhabitants in internationally catalogued journals, according to Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (Science Citation Index Expanded). This placed Zimbabwe sixth out of the 15 SADC countries, behind Namibia (59), Mauritius (71), Botswana (103) and, above all, South Africa (175) and the Seychelles (364).

Their spread straddles both the [[equator]] and the [[180th meridian]], although the [[International Date Line]] goes round Kiribati and swings far to the east, almost reaching the [[150th meridian west|150\u00b0W meridian]]. This brings the [[Line Islands]] into the same day as the Kiribati Islands. Kiribati's easternmost islands, the southern Line Islands, south of [[Hawaii]], have the most advanced time on Earth: [[UTC+14:00|UTC+14]] hours.\n\nKiribati became independent from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1979. The capital, [[South Tarawa]], which is now the most populated area, consists of a number of islets, connected by a series of [[causeway]]s. These comprise about half the area of [[Tarawa]] Atoll.\n\nKiribati is a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC), [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], and the [[World Bank]], and became a full member of the [[United Nations]] in 1999.\n\n==Etymology<!--linked-->==\nThe name ''Kiribati'' was adopted at independence. It is the local enunciation of ''Gilberts''. This name derives from the main archipelago that forms the nation. It was named the [[Gilbert Islands]] after the British explorer [[Thomas Gilbert (sea captain)|Thomas Gilbert]]. He sighted many of the islands in 1788 while mapping out the Outer Passage route from [[Port Jackson]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]].<ref name=LifeMagazine1944-05-22>\n{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bk8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA91 |title = The Gilberts & Marshalls: A distinguished historian recalls the past of two recently captured pacific groups |journal= [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date = 1944-05-22 |author = [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] |accessdate = 2009-10-14 }}</ref>\n\nThe Kiribati archipelago was named ''\u00celes Gilbert'' (''Gilbert Islands'' in English), in about 1820, by Russian admiral [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Adam von Krusenstern]] and French captain [[Louis Isidore Duperrey|Louis Duperrey]]. Both their maps, published in 1820, were written in French. In English, the archipelago was often referred to as the Kingsmills in the 19th century, although the name Gilbert Islands was used increasingly, including in the Western Pacific Order in Council of 1877.\n\nThe name Gilbert was incorporated into the name of the entire [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony]] from 1916, and was retained after the Ellice Islands became the separate nation of [[Tuvalu]] in 1976. The spelling of ''Gilberts'' in the [[Gilbertese language]] as Kiribati may be found in books in Gilbertese prepared by missionaries and others (see e.g. Hawaiian Board of Missionaries, 1895).<ref>{{cite book|author=Hawaiian board of missions, publishers|title=Te Rikitianere ni baibara, ae te boki ni kaoti nanon taeka ianena aika 376 aika n te baibara ni kiribati: ma te kankaotanti ae karako.

The location of Fanning Island, one of the closest formations to Hawaii, led to its annexation by the British Empire in 1888. Nearby candidates including Palmyra Island were disfavored due to the lack of adequate landing sites.\n\n[[File:165th Infantry assault wave attacking Butaritari, Yellow Beach Two, find it slow going in the coral bottom waters.... - NARA - 531172.tif|thumb|165th Infantry assault wave attacking Butaritari, Yellow Beach Two, [[Makin Atoll]], 20 November 1943]] \nThe United States eventually incorporated the Northern Line into its territories and did the same with the Phoenix Islands which lie between Kiribati and the Line Islands including Howland, Jarvis, and Baker islands, thus, bringing about a territorial dispute. This was eventually resolved and they became part of Kiribati as part of the [[Treaty of Tarawa]]. This was signed shortly after independence and ratified in 1983, the United States relinquishing all claims to the sparsely inhabited Phoenix Islands and those of the Line Islands that are part of Kiribati territory.\n\n[[File:Tarawa.jpg|thumb|American Marines assault a Japanese bunker during the [[Battle of Tarawa]], November 1943.]]\n[[Tarawa Atoll]] and others of the Gilbert group were occupied by Japan from 1941 to 1943 during World War II.

Marines landed in November 1943 and the [[Battle of Tarawa]] ensued.\n\nFurther military operations in the colony occurred in the late 1950s and early 1960s when [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] was used by the United States and United Kingdom for [[nuclear weapons testing]] including [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]].\n\nInstitutions of internal self-rule were established on Tarawa from about 1967. The Ellice Islands were separated from the rest of the colony in 1975 and granted their own internal self-rule institutions.

The executive branch consists of a president (''te Beretitenti''), a vice-president and a cabinet. The president, who is also chief of the cabinet, is elected from the legislature and is limited to three four-year terms. He remains a member of the Assembly while serving as president. The cabinet is composed of the president, vice-president, and 10 ministers (appointed by the president) who are also members of the House of Assembly.\n\nThe legislative branch is the unicameral ''Maneaba Ni Maungatabu'' (House of Assembly). It has elected members, including by constitutional mandate a representative of the Banaban people in [[Fiji]] (Banaba Island, former Ocean Island), in addition to the attorney general, who serves as an ''ex-officio'' member. Legislators serve for a four-year term.\n\nThe constitutional provisions governing administration of justice are similar to those in other former British possessions in that the judiciary is free from governmental interference. The judicial branch is made up of the High Court (in Betio) and the Court of Appeal. The president appoints the presiding judges.\n\nLocal government is through island councils with elected members. Local affairs are handled in a manner similar to town meetings in colonial America. Island councils make their own estimates of revenue and expenditure and generally are free from central government controls. There are a total of 21 inhabited islands in Kiribati. Each inhabited island has its own council. Since independence, Kiribati is no longer divided into districts (see [[Districts of Kiribati|Subdivisions of Kiribati]]).\n\nKiribati has formal political parties but their organisation is quite informal. Ad&nbsp;hoc opposition groups tend to coalesce around specific issues. Today the only recognisable parties are the ''Boutokaan te Koaua'' Party, ''Maneaban te Mauri'' Party, ''Maurin Kiribati'' Party and ''Tabomoa'' Party. There is universal suffrage at age 18.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Kiribati}}\n\nKiribati maintains close relations with its Pacific neighbours, Australia, New Zealand, Republic of China (Taiwan), Japan and Fiji. The first three of these provide the majority of the country's foreign aid. [[Taiwan]] and Japan also have specified-period licences to fish in Kiribati's waters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Background Notes: Kiribati, May 1996|url=https://1997-2001.state.gov/background_notes/kiribati_0596_bgn.html|publisher=U.S. State Department|year=1996|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}</ref> There are four resident diplomatic missions headquartered in Kiribati: the Embassies of the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) and Cuba and the High Commissions of [[List of Australian High Commissioners to Kiribati|Australia]] and New Zealand.\n\nIn November 1999 Kiribati agreed to allow Japan's [[National Space Development Agency]] to lease land on Christmas Island for 20 years, on which to build a [[spaceport]].<ref name=SpaceDaily2000>{{cite news |title=Kiribati Gives Okay to Christmas Island Spaceport |url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/japan-hopex-00d.html |newspaper=Space Daily News |date=11 May 2000 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> The agreement stipulated that Japan was to pay US$840,000 per year and would also pay for any damage to roads and the environment.<ref name=SpaceDaily2000 /> A Japanese-built downrange [[tracking station]] operates on Kiritimati<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fdsn.org/station_book/IU/XMAS/xmas.html |title=FDSN Station Info \u2013 XMAS |publisher = Fdsn.org |date=22 August 1997 |accessdate=14 May 2010}}</ref> and an abandoned airfield on the island was designated as the landing strip for a proposed reusable unmanned [[space shuttle]] called [[HOPE-X]].

Kiribati is a member of the [[Alliance of Small Island States]] (AOSIS), an intergovernmental organisation of low-lying coastal and small island countries. Established in 1990, the main purpose of the alliance is to consolidate the voices of [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) to address global warming. AOSIS has been very active from its inception, putting forward the first draft text in the [[Kyoto Protocol]] negotiations as early as 1994.\n\nIn 2009, President Tong attended the [[Climate Vulnerable Forum]] ([[Climate Vulnerable Forum|V11]]) in the [[Maldives]], with 10 other countries that are vulnerable to climate change, and signed the Bandos Island declaration on 10 November 2009, pledging to show moral leadership and commence greening their economies by voluntarily committing to achieving [[carbon neutrality]].\n\nIn November 2010, Kiribati hosted the [[Tarawa Climate Change Conference]] (TCCC) to support the president of Kiribati's initiative to hold a consultative forum between vulnerable states and their partners. The conference strove to create an enabling environment for multi-party negotiations under the auspices of the UNFCCC. The conference was a successor event to the Climate Vulnerable Forum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/tarawa_climate_change_conference.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 February 2012 |title=Climate Change in Kiribati, Tarawa Climate Change Conference Issues Ambo Declaration |publisher=Office of the President of Kiribati |date=12 November 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2018}}</ref> The ultimate objective of TCCC was to reduce the number and intensity of fault lines between parties to the COP process, explore elements of agreement between the parties and thereby to support Kiribati's and other parties' contribution to [[COP16]] held in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], from 29 November to 10 December 2010.\n\nIn 2013, President Tong has spoken of climate-change induced sea level rise as \"inevitable\". \"For our people to survive, then they will have to migrate.

Initiatives include improving water supply management in and around Tarawa; coastal management protection measures such as mangrove re-plantation and protection of public infrastructure; strengthening laws to reduce coastal erosion; and population settlement planning to reduce personal risks.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120202030155/http://www.climate.gov.ki/Kiribati_climate_change_strategies.html Government of Kiribati Climate Change Strategies]. climate.gov.ki</ref>\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:Line5304 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|A tropical islet with palm fronds oriented in the direction of the prevailing winds.]]\nThe climate is pleasant from April to October, with predominant northeastern winds and stable temperatures close to {{convert|30|C}}.

Commercially viable [[phosphate]] deposits on [[Banaba Island|Banaba]] were exhausted at the time of independence. [[Copra]] and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports. Kiribati is considered one of the [[Least developed country|least developed countries]] in the world.\n\nIn one form or another, Kiribati gets a large portion of its income from abroad. Examples include fishing licenses, development assistance, worker [[remittance]]s, and tourism. Given Kiribati's limited domestic production ability, it must import nearly all of its essential foodstuffs and manufactured items; it depends on these external sources of income for financing.\n\nThe economy of Kiribati benefits from international development assistance programs. The multilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were the [[European Union]] (A$9 million), the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (A$3.7 million), UNICEF, and the [[World Health Organization]] (A$100,000).<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\"/> The bilateral donors providing development assistance in 2009 were Australia (A$11 million), Japan (A$2 million), [[New Zealand]] (A$6.6 million), [[Taiwan]] (A$10.6 million), and other donors providing A$16.2 million, including technical assistance grants from the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=\"IMF 2011 SA\">{{cite web |title = Kiribati: Statistical Appendix |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24872.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/114 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |title = Kiribati: 2011 Article IV Consultation-Staff Report, Informational Annexes, Debt Sustainability Analysis, Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion, and Statement by the Executive Director for Kiribati |url = https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=24871.0 |publisher = International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 11/113 |date = 24 May 2011 |accessdate = 10 September 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe major donors in 2010/2011 were Australia (A$15 million), Taiwan (A$11 million); New Zealand (A$6 million), the [[World Bank]] (A$4 million) and the [[Asian Development Bank]].<ref name=mfat>{{cite web |url = http://www.mfat.govt.nz/Countries/Pacific/Kiribati.php |title = New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) |accessdate = 10 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1956, Kiribati established a [[sovereign wealth fund]] to act as a store of wealth for the country's earnings from [[phosphate]] mining.\nIn 2008, the [[Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund]] was valued at US$400 million.<ref>[http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund/kiribati.php Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute].

It is estimated to have grown by 1.75% for the year. Despite a weather-related drop in copra production, private sector activity appears to have picked up, especially in retail. Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base. Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled.

Most houses are made of materials obtained from coconut and pandanus trees. Frequent droughts and infertile soil hinder reliable large-scale agriculture, so the islanders have largely turned to the sea for livelihood and subsistence. Most are outrigger sailors and fishermen. Copra plantations serve as a second source of employment. In recent years large numbers of citizens have moved to the more urban island capital of Tarawa. Increasing urbanisation has raised the population of South Tarawa to 50,182.<ref name=\"IMF 2011\"/>{{page needed|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Landscape, Kiribati, 2011.

Ethnically, the I-Kiribati are [[Micronesia]]ns. Recent archaeological evidence indicates that [[Austronesians]] originally settled the islands thousands of years ago. Around the 14th century, Fijians, Samoans, and Tongans invaded the islands, thus diversifying the ethnic range and introducing [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]] linguistic traits. Intermarriage among all ancestral groups, however, has led to a population reasonably homogeneous in appearance and traditions.\n\n=== Languages ===\nThe people of Kiribati speak an [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic language]] called [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]]. Although English is also an [[official language]], it is not used very often outside the island capital of Tarawa. It is more likely that English is mixed in its use with Gilbertese. Older generations of I-Kiribati tend to use more complicated versions of the language. Several words in Gilbertese have been adopted from European settlers, for instance, ''kamea'' is the Gilbertese word for dog,<ref>[http://www.trussel.com/kir/glossary.htm Te taetae ni Kiribati \u2013 Kiribati Language Lessons \u2013 Glossary].

Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (''Te Kaimatoa'') or the hip dance (''Te Buki''), a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also [[tirere|stick dance]]s which accompany legends and semi-historical stories {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. These stick dances or \"tirere\" (pronounced seerere) are performed only during major festivals.\n\n===Dance===\n{{main|Dance in Kiribati}}\n[[File:Bonriki International Airportwelcomejpg.jpg|thumb|A welcome display.]]\nThe uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The Frigate bird (''Fregata minor'') on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer.<ref>[[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''In the South Seas'' and the [[Montana New Zealand Book Awards]] winner ''Akekeia!'' by Tony & Joan Whincup, Wellington, 2001.</ref>\n\n===Sport===\n{{see also|Kiribati at the Olympics|Kiribati at the 2014 Commonwealth Games}}\nKiribati has competed at the [[Commonwealth Games]] since [[1998 Commonwealth Games|1998]] and the [[Summer Olympics]] since [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]].

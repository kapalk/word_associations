It gained ''de-jure'' independence as a [[parliamentary republic]] on 24 October 1945, when [[Syrian Republic (1946\u20131963)|Republic of Syria]] became a founding member of the United Nations, an act which legally ended the former French Mandate \u2013 although French troops did not leave the country until April 1946. The post-independence period was tumultuous, and a large number of [[military coup]]s and coup attempts shook the country in the period 1949\u201371. In 1958, Syria entered a brief union with Egypt called the [[United Arab Republic]], which was terminated by the [[1961 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The republic was renamed into the Arab Republic of Syria in late 1961 after [[Syrian constitutional referendum, 1961|December 1 constitutional referendum]], and was increasingly unstable until the [[1963 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|1963 Ba'athist coup d'\u00e9tat]], since which the Ba'ath Party has maintained its power.

The following Neolithic period ([[PPNB]]) is represented by rectangular houses of [[Mureybet]] culture. At the time of the pre-pottery Neolithic, people used vessels made of stone, gyps and burnt lime ([[White Ware|Vaisselle blanche]]).

From this point, the region became known as [[Aramea]] or [[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]. There was also a synthesis between the Semitic Arameans and the remnants of the Indo-European [[Hittites]], with the founding of a number of [[Syro-Hittite]] states centered in north central Aram (Syria) and south central Asia Minor (modern Turkey), including [[Palistin]], [[Carchemish]] and [[Sam'al]].\n\n[[File:Geretteteg\u00f6tter l\u00f6wen.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Reliefs from [[Tel Halaf]] dating to the Aramean kingdom of [[Bit Bahiani]] ]]\nA [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] group known as the [[Phoenicians]] came to dominate the coasts of Syria, (and also Lebanon and northern [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) from the 13th century BC, founding city states such as [[Amrit]], [[Simyra]], [[Arwad]], [[Arab al-Mulk|Paltos]], [[Latakia#Ancient settlement and founding|Ramitha]] and [[Tell Sukas|Shuksi]]. From these coastal regions, they eventually spread their influence throughout the [[Mediterranean]], including building colonies in [[Malta]], Sicily, the [[Iberian peninsula]] (modern Spain and [[Portugal]]), and the coasts of North Africa and most significantly, founding the major city state of [[Carthage]] (in modern [[Tunisia]]) in the 9th century BC, which was much later to become the center of a major empire, rivaling the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nSyria and the entire [[Near East]] and beyond then fell to the vast [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911 BC \u2013 605 BC). The Assyrians introduced [[Imperial Aramaic]] as the [[lingua franca]] of their empire. This language was to remain dominant in Syria and the entire [[Near East]] until after the [[Arab]] [[Islamic]] conquest in the 7th and 8th centuries AD, and was to be a vehicle for the spread of Christianity. The Assyrians named their colonies of Syria and Lebanon [[Eber-Nari]]. Assyrian domination ended after the Assyrians greatly weakened themselves in a series of brutal internal civil wars, followed by an attacking coalition of their former subject peoples; the [[Medes]], [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]]. During the fall of Assyria, the [[Scythians]] ravaged and plundered much of Syria. The last stand of the Assyrian army was at [[Carchemish]] in northern Syria in 605 BC.\n\nThe Assyrian Empire was followed by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605 BC \u2013 539 BC).  During this period, Syria became a battle ground between Babylonia and another former Assyrian colony, that of [[Egypt]]. The Babylonians, like their Assyrian relations, were victorious over Egypt.\n\n=== Classical antiquity ===\n{{Main|Eber-Nari|Coele-Syria|Syria (Roman province)|Syria-Palaestina}}\n[[File:Palmyra 03.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient city of [[Palmyra]] before the war]]\n[[File:Zenobia obversee.png|thumb|left|[[Zenobia]], queen of Palmyra]]\n\nThe [[Achaemenid Empire]], founded by [[Cyrus the Great]], took [[Eber-Nari|Syria]] from Babylonia as part of its hegemony of Southwest Asia in 539 BC. The [[Persian people|Persians]], having spent four centuries under Assyrian rule, retained Imperial Aramaic as diplomatic language in the Achaemenid Empire (539 BC \u2013 330 BC), and also the Assyrian name of the [[satrapy]] of Aram/Syria [[Eber-Nari]].\n\nSyria was conquered by the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[Macedonian Empire]], ruled by [[Alexander the Great]] circa 330 BC, and consequently became [[Coele-Syria]] province of the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Seleucid Empire]] (323 BC \u2013 64 BC), with the Seleucid kings styling themselves 'King of Syria' and the city of Antioch being its capital starting from 240.\n\nThus, it was the Greeks who introduced the name \"Syria\" to the region. Originally an Indo-European corruption of \"Assyria\" in northern Mesopotamia, the Greeks used this term to describe not only Assyria itself but also the lands to the west which had for centuries been under Assyrian dominion.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rollinger | first1 = Robert | year = 2006 | title = The terms \"Assyria\" and \"Syria\" again\" (PDF) | url = | journal = Journal of Near Eastern Studies | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 284\u2013287 | doi = 10.1086/511103 }}</ref> Thus in the [[Greco-Roman]] world both the [[Arameans]] of Syria and the [[Old Assyrian Empire|Assyrians]] of Mesopotamia to the east were referred to as \"Syrians\" or \"Syriacs\", despite these being distinct peoples in their own right, a confusion which would continue into the modern world. Eventually parts of southern Seleucid Syria were taken by [[Judean]] [[Hasmoneans]] upon the slow disintegration of the Hellenistic Empire.\n\nSyria briefly came under [[Armenians|Armenian]] control from 83 BC, with the conquests of the Armenian king [[Tigranes the Great]], who was welcomed as a savior from the Seleucids and Romans by the Syrian people. However, [[Pompey the Great]], a general of the [[Roman Empire]] rode to Syria, captured [[Antioch]], its capital, and turned Syria into a [[Syria (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64 BC, thus ending the Armenian control over the region which had lasted two decades. Syria prospered under Roman rule, being strategically located on the silk road which gave it massive wealth and importance, making it the battleground for the rivaling Romans and Persians.\n\n[[File:Bosra_pano_Syria.jpg|thumb|[[Roman Theatre at Bosra]] in the province of [[Arabia Petraea|Arabia]], present-day Syria]]\n[[File:The Jupiter temple in Damascus.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of Jupiter, Damascus]]]]\n[[Palmyra]], a rich and sometimes powerful native [[Aramaic]]-speaking kingdom arose in northern Syria in the 2nd century; the Palmyrene established a trade network that made the city one of the richest in the Roman empire.

[[Syriac Christianity]] had taken hold as the major religion, although others still followed [[Judaism]], [[Mithraism]], [[Manicheanism]], [[Classical mythology|Greco-Roman Religion]], [[Canaanite Religion]] and [[Mesopotamian Religion]].

Diplomatic relations have been severed with several countries including: Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Germany, Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, the United States, Belgium, Spain, and the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.<ref>{{cite web|last=Strenger |first=Carlo |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/middle-east/assad-takes-a-page-out-of-russia-s-book-in-his-war-against-rebels-1.411789 |title=Assad takes a page out of Russia's book in his war against rebels|work=Haaretz |date=8 February 2012 |accessdate=15 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Syria military involvement.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of world and Syria (red) with military involvement.{{legend|blue|Countries that support the Syrian government}}{{legend|Green|Countries that support the Syrian rebels}}]]\n\nFrom the Arab league, Syria continues to maintain diplomatic relations with [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], Iraq, Lebanon, [[Sudan]] and [[Yemen]]. Syria's violence against civilians has also seen it suspended from the [[Arab League]] and the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] in 2012. Syria continues to foster good relations with its traditional allies, Iran and Russia, who are among the few countries which have supported the Syrian government in its conflict with the [[Syrian opposition]].\n\nSyria is included in the European Union's [[European Neighbourhood Policy]] (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.\n\n====International disputes====\n{{See also|Turkish occupation of northern Syria|Israeli-occupied territories}}\nIn 1939, while Syria was still a French mandate the French ceded the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]] to [[Turkey]] as part of a treaty of friendship in World War II. In order to facilitate this, a faulty election was done in which ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]] who were originally from the Sanjak but lived in [[Adana]] and other areas near the border in Turkey came to vote in the elections, shifting the election in favor of secession. Through this, the [[Hatay Province]] of Turkey was formed.

Syrian writers, many of whom migrated to Egypt, played a crucial role in the [[nahda]] or Arab literary and cultural revival of the 19th century. Prominent contemporary Syrian writers include, among others, [[Ali Ahmad Said|Adonis]], [[Muhammad al-Maghut|Muhammad Maghout]], [[Haidar Haidar]], [[Ghada al-Samman]], [[Nizar Qabbani]] and [[Zakariyya Tamer]].\n\nBa'ath Party rule, since the [[1966 Syrian coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 coup]], has brought about renewed censorship. In this context, the genre of the historical novel, spearheaded by [[Nabil Sulayman]], [[Fawwaz Haddad]], [[Khyri al-Dhahabi]] and [[Nihad Siris]], is sometimes used as a means of expressing dissent, critiquing the present through a depiction of the past. Syrian [[List of folklores|folk narrative]], as a subgenre of historical fiction, is imbued with [[magical realism]], and is also used as a means of veiled criticism of the present. [[Salim Barakat]], a Syrian \u00e9migr\u00e9 living in Sweden, is one of the leading figures of the genre. Contemporary Syrian literature also encompasses science fiction and futuristic [[utopia]]e ([[Nuhad Sharif]], [[Talib Umran]]), which may also serve as media of dissent.\n\n===Music===\n\n[[Music of Syria|The Syrian music scene]], in particular that of Damascus, has long been among the Arab world's most important, especially in the field of [[classical Arab music]]. Syria has produced several pan-Arab stars, including [[Asmahan]], [[Farid al-Atrash]] and singer [[Lena Chamamyan]]. The city of Aleppo is known for its [[muwashshah]], a form of [[Andalous]] sung poetry popularized by [[Sabri Moudallal]], as well as for popular stars like [[Sabah Fakhri]].\n\n===Media===\n[[Television in Syria|Television was introduced to Syria]] and Egypt in 1960, when both were part of the [[United Arab Republic]]. It broadcast in black and white until 1976.

Damascus was home to the fifth and seventh [[Pan Arab Games]]. Many popular football teams are based in Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Latakia, etc.\n\nThe [[Abbasiyyin Stadium]] in Damascus is home to the [[Syria national football team|Syrian national football team]]. The team enjoyed some success, having qualified for four [[Asian Cup]] competitions.

Syrian food mostly consists of Southern Mediterranean, Greek, and Southwest Asian dishes. Some Syrian dishes also evolved from Turkish and French cooking: dishes like [[Kebab|shish kebab]], stuffed zucchini/courgette, and ''[[dolma|yabra\u02be]]'' (stuffed grape leaves, the word ''yabra\u02be'' deriving from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word ''yaprak'', meaning leaf).\n\nThe main dishes that form Syrian cuisine are [[kibbeh]], [[hummus]], [[tabbouleh]], [[fattoush]], [[strained yogurt|labneh]], [[shawarma]], [[mujaddara]], [[shanklish]], [[past\u0131rma]], [[sujuk]] and baklava. [[Baklava]] is made of [[filo]] pastry filled with chopped nuts and soaked in [[honey]]. Syrians often serve selections of appetizers, known as [[meze]], before the main course. [[Za'atar]], [[minced beef]], and cheese [[manakish]] are popular [[hors d'\u0153uvres]]. The Arabic flatbread [[khubz]] is always eaten together with meze.\n\nDrinks in Syria vary, depending on the time of day and the occasion. [[Arabic coffee]], also known as [[Turkish coffee]], is the most well-known hot drink, usually prepared in the morning at breakfast or in the evening. It is usually served for guests or after food. [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an alcoholic drink, is a well-known beverage, served mostly on special occasions. Other Syrian beverages include [[ayran]], [[jallab]], [[white coffee]], and a locally manufactured beer called Al Shark.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/travel/2009/1015/damascus.html |title=Damascus |date=15 October 2009 |publisher=Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann |accessdate=26 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204125219/http://www.rte.ie/travel/2009/1015/damascus.html |archivedate=4 December 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== Education ==\n{{Main|Education in Syria}}\n[[File:Damascus University.jpg|thumb|[[Damascus University]] headquarters in [[Baramkeh]]]]\nEducation is free and compulsory from ages 6 to 12.

It is bordered by [[Sierra Leone]] to its northwest, [[Guinea]] to its north, [[Ivory Coast]] to its east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to its south-southwest. It covers an area of {{convert|111369|km2|sqmi|abbr=out|sp=us}} and has a population of around 4,700,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/central-african-republic-population/|title=Central African Republic|accessdate=19 March 2018}}</ref> [[English language|English]] is the official language and over 20 indigenous languages are spoken, representing the numerous ethnic groups who make up more than 95% of the population. The country's capital and largest [[List of cities in Liberia|city]] is [[Monrovia]].\n\nLiberia began as a settlement of the [[American Colonization Society]] (ACS), who believed black people would face better chances for freedom and prosperity in [[Africa]] than in the [[United States]].<ref name=AFP/> The country declared its independence on July 26, 1847. The U.S. did not recognize Liberia's independence until February 5, 1862, during the [[American Civil War]]. Between January 7, 1822, and the American Civil War, more than 15,000 freed and free-born black people who faced legislated limits in the U.S., and 3,198 [[Afro-Caribbeans]], relocated to the settlement.<ref name=TDIH/> The [[African American|black]] settlers carried their culture and tradition with them to Liberia. The Liberian constitution and flag were modeled after those of the U.S. On January 3, 1848, [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], a wealthy, free-born African American from [[Virginia]] who settled in Liberia, was elected as Liberia's first [[President of Liberia|president]] after the people proclaimed independence.<ref name=TDIH>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/liberian-independence-proclaimed \"July 26, 1847 Liberian independence proclaimed\"], This Day In History, History website.</ref>\n\nLiberia was the first African republic to proclaim its independence, and is Africa's first and oldest modern republic. Liberia retained its independence during the [[Scramble for Africa]]. During [[World War II]], Liberia supported the United States war efforts against Germany and in turn, the U.S. invested in considerable infrastructure in Liberia to help its war effort, which also aided the country in modernizing and improving its major air transportation facilities. In addition, President [[William Tubman]] encouraged economic changes. Internationally, Liberia was a founding member of the [[League of Nations]], [[United Nations]], and the [[Organisation of African Unity]].\n\nThe Americo-Liberian settlers did not relate well to the indigenous peoples they encountered, especially those in communities of the more isolated \"[[the bush|bush]]\". The colonial settlements were raided by the [[Kru people|Kru]] and [[Grebo people|Grebo]] from their inland chiefdoms. Americo-Liberians developed as a small elite that held on to political power, and the indigenous tribesmen were excluded from birthright citizenship in their own lands until 1904, in a repetition of the United States' treatment of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref name=\"Liberia\">\n{{cite web\n|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/6618.htm \n|title=Liberia\n|author= U.S. State Department\n}}</ref> The Americo-Liberians promoted religious organizations to set up missions and schools to educate the indigenous peoples.\n\nPolitical tensions from the rule of [[William R. Tolbert]] resulted in a military [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] in 1980 during which Tolbert was killed, marking the beginning of years-long political instability. Five years of military rule by the [[People's Redemption Council]] and five years of civilian rule by the [[National Democratic Party of Liberia]] were followed by the [[First Liberian Civil War|First]] and [[Second Liberian Civil War]]s.

Liberia was a part of the [[Kingdom of Koya]] from 1450 to 1898. As inland regions underwent [[desertification]], inhabitants moved to the wetter coast.

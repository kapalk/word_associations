Under the [[Bagratuni dynasty]], the [[Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia]] was restored in the 9th century. Declining due to the wars against the Byzantines, the kingdom fell in 1045 and Armenia was soon after invaded by the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]]. An Armenian principality and later a kingdom [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]] was located on the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] between the 11th and 14th centuries.\n\nBetween the 16th and 19th centuries, the traditional Armenian homeland composed of [[Eastern Armenia]] and [[Western Armenia]] came under the rule of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Persian Empire|Iranian]] empires, repeatedly ruled by either of the two over the centuries. By the 19th century, Eastern Armenia had been conquered by the [[Russian Empire]], while most of the western parts of the traditional Armenian homeland remained under Ottoman rule. During [[World War I]], Armenians living in their ancestral lands in the Ottoman Empire were systematically exterminated in the [[Armenian Genocide]]. In 1918, following the [[Russian Revolution]], all non-Russian countries declared their independence after the Russian Empire ceased to exist, leading to the establishment of the [[First Republic of Armenia]]. By 1920, the state was incorporated into the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]], and in 1922 became a founding member of the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1936, the Transcaucasian state was dissolved, transforming its constituent states, including the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]], into full [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union republics]]. The modern Republic of Armenia became independent in 1991 during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]].\n\nArmenia recognises the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], the world's oldest national church, as the country's primary religious establishment.<ref>The republic has [[separation of church and state]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.am/en/constitution-2015/|title=Constitution of Armenia, Article 18|publisher=president.am}}</ref> The unique [[Armenian alphabet]] was invented by [[Mesrop Mashtots]] in 405 AD.\n\nArmenia is a member of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]], the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[Collective Security Treaty Organization]].

The principality was ruled by the Prince of Armenia, and recognised by the [[Caliphate|Caliph]] and the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]]. It was part of the administrative division/emirate ''[[Arminiya]]'' created by the Arabs, which also included parts of Georgia and [[Caucasian Albania]], and had its centre in the Armenian city, [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]]. Arminiya lasted until 884, when it regained its independence from the weakened [[Abbasid Caliphate]] under [[Ashot I of Armenia]].\n\nThe reemergent Armenian kingdom was ruled by the [[Bagratuni dynasty]] and lasted until 1045. In time, several areas of the Bagratid Armenia separated as independent kingdoms and principalities such as the Kingdom of [[Vaspurakan]] ruled by the House of [[Artsruni]] in the south, Kingdom of [[Syunik Province|Syunik]] in the east, or [[Kingdom of Artsakh]] on the territory of modern [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], while still recognising the supremacy of the Bagratid kings.\n\n[[File:Cilician Armenia-en.svg|thumb|The [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], 1198\u20131375]]\n\nIn 1045, the Byzantine Empire conquered Bagratid Armenia.

The Byzantine governor of the palace gave them shelter where the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] was eventually established on 6 January 1198 under [[Leo I, King of Armenia]], a descendant of Prince Ruben.\n\nCilicia was a strong ally of the [[Crusades|European Crusaders]], and saw itself as a bastion of Christendom in the East. Cilicia's significance in Armenian history and statehood is also attested by the transfer of the seat of the Catholicos of the Armenian Apostolic Church, the spiritual leader of the Armenian people, to the region.\n\nThe Seljuk Empire soon started to collapse. In the early 12th century, Armenian princes of the Zakarid family drove out the Seljuk Turks and established a semi-independent principality in northern and eastern Armenia known as [[Zakarid Armenia]], which lasted under the patronage of the [[History of Georgia (country)|Georgian Kingdom]]. The [[Orbelian Dynasty]] shared control with the Zakarids in various parts of the country, especially in Syunik and [[Vayots Dzor Province|Vayots Dzor]], while the [[House of Hasan-Jalalyan]] controlled provinces of [[Artsakh (historic province)|Artsakh]] and [[Utik]] as the Kingdom of Artsakh.\n\n=== Early Modern era ===\n{{further|Iranian Armenia (1502\u20131828)|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Russian Armenia}}\nDuring the 1230s, the [[Mongol Empire]] conquered Zakarid Armenia and then the remainder of Armenia.

However, as Christians under a strict Muslim [[social structure]], Armenians faced pervasive discrimination. When they began pushing for more rights within the Ottoman Empire, Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]], in response, organised state-sponsored massacres against the Armenians between 1894 and 1896, resulting in an estimated death toll of 80,000 to 300,000 people.

Dashnaktsutyun members also formed [[Armenian fedayi]] groups that defended Armenian civilians through armed resistance. The Dashnaks also worked for the wider goal of creating a \"free, independent and unified\" Armenia, although they sometimes set aside this goal in favour of a more realistic approach, such as advocating autonomy.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire began to collapse, and in 1908, the [[Young Turk Revolution]] overthrew the government of Sultan Hamid. In April 1909, the [[Adana massacre]] occurred in the [[Adana Vilayet]] of the Ottoman Empire resulting in the deaths of as many as 20,000\u201330,000 Armenians. The Armenians living in the empire hoped that the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] would change their second-class status.

This federation, however, lasted from only February to May 1918, when all three parties decided to dissolve it. As a result, the Dashnaktsutyun government of Eastern Armenia declared its independence on 28 May as the [[First Republic of Armenia]] under the leadership of [[Aram Manukian]].\n\nThe First Republic's short-lived independence was fraught with war, [[territorial dispute]]s, and a mass influx of refugees from Ottoman Armenia, bringing with them disease and starvation. The [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]], appalled by the actions of the Ottoman government, sought to help the newly founded Armenian state through relief funds and other forms of support.\n\nAt the end of the war, the victorious powers sought to divide up the Ottoman Empire. Signed between the [[Allies of World War I|Allied and Associated Powers]] and [[Ottoman Empire]] at [[S\u00e8vres]] on 10 August 1920, the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] promised to maintain the existence of the Armenian republic and to attach the former territories of Ottoman Armenia to it. Because the new borders of Armenia were to be drawn by United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Ottoman Armenia was also referred to as \"[[Wilsonian Armenia]]\". In addition, just days prior, on 5 August 1920, [[Mihran Damadian]] of the Armenian National Union, the de facto Armenian administration in Cilicia, declared the independence of [[Cilicia]] as an Armenian autonomous republic under French protectorate.<ref>Hovannisian, Richard, and Simon Payaslian.

The treaty, however, was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], and never came into effect. The movement used the treaty as the occasion to declare itself the rightful [[Politics of Turkey|government of Turkey]], replacing the monarchy based in [[Istanbul]] with a republic based in [[Ankara]].\n\n[[File:11thRedArmyYerevan.jpg|thumb|left|Advance of the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|11th Red Army]] into the city of Yerevan]]\nIn 1920, Turkish nationalist forces invaded the fledgling Armenian republic from the east. Turkish forces under the command of [[K\u00e2z\u0131m Karabekir|Kaz\u0131m Karabekir]] captured Armenian territories that Russia had annexed in the aftermath of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|1877\u20131878 Russo-Turkish War]] and occupied the old city of Alexandropol (present-day [[Gyumri]]). The violent conflict finally concluded with the [[Treaty of Alexandropol]] on 2 December 1920. The treaty forced Armenia to disarm most of its [[Armed forces|military forces]], cede all former Ottoman territory granted to it by the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], and to give up all the \"Wilsonian Armenia\" granted to it at the S\u00e8vres treaty. Simultaneously, the [[11th Army (RSFSR)|Soviet Eleventh Army]], under the command of [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze]], invaded Armenia at Karavansarai (present-day [[Ijevan]]) on 29 November. By 4 December, Ordzhonikidze's forces entered Yerevan and the short-lived Armenian republic collapsed.\n\nAfter the fall of the republic, the [[February Uprising]] soon took place in 1921, and led to the establishment of the [[Republic of Mountainous Armenia]] by Armenian forces under command of [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] on 26 April, which fought off both Soviet and Turkish intrusions in the Zangezur region of southern Armenia.

They received medicine, food, and other provisions from Moscow, and communist rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire.

Clashes soon broke out between the NAA and [[Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs|Soviet Internal Security Forces]] (MVD) troops based in Yerevan when Armenians decided to commemorate the establishment of the 1918 First Republic of Armenia. The violence resulted in the deaths of five Armenians killed in a shootout with the MVD at the railway station. Witnesses there claimed that the MVD used excessive force and that they had instigated the fighting.\n\nFurther firefights between Armenian militiamen and Soviet troops occurred in [[Nubarashen|Sovetashen]], near the capital and resulted in the deaths of over 26 people, mostly Armenians.

As the economic situation stabilised and growth resumed, the share of agriculture in GDP dropped to slightly over 20% (2006 data), although the share of agriculture in employment remained more than 40%.<ref name=yb2007>[http://www.armstat.am/en/?nid=179 Statistical Yearbook 2007], Armenia National Statistical Service, Yerevan</ref>\n\n[[File:Mount Ararat and the Yerevan skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Yerevan]] is the economic and cultural centre of Armenia.]]\nArmenian mines produce copper, zinc, gold, and lead. The vast majority of energy is produced with fuel imported from Russia, including gas and nuclear fuel (for its one nuclear power plant); the main domestic energy source is hydroelectric. Small deposits of coal, gas, and petroleum exist but have not yet been developed.\n\nLike other [[Post-Soviet states|newly independent states]] of the former Soviet Union, Armenia's economy suffers from the breakdown of former Soviet trading patterns. Soviet investment in and support of Armenian industry has virtually disappeared, so that few major enterprises are still able to function. In addition, the effects of the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|1988 Spitak earthquake]], which killed more than 25,000 people and made 500,000 homeless, are still being felt. The conflict with Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh has not been resolved. The closure of Azerbaijani and Turkish borders has devastated the economy, because Armenia depends on outside supplies of energy and most raw materials. Land routes through Georgia and Iran are inadequate or unreliable. The GDP fell nearly 60% between 1989 and 1993, but then resumed robust growth.<ref name=agri/> The national currency, the dram, suffered hyperinflation for the first years after its introduction in 1993.\n\nNevertheless, the government was able to make wide-ranging economic reforms that paid off in dramatically lower inflation and steady growth. The 1994 cease-fire in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has also helped the economy. Armenia has had strong economic growth since 1995, building on the turnaround that began the previous year, and inflation has been negligible for the past several years. New sectors, such as precious-stone processing and jewelry making, information and communication technology, and even tourism are beginning to supplement more traditional sectors of the economy, such as agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/armenia-becoming-world-class-hiking-destination-180965096/|title=How Armenia Plans to Become the Next World-Class Hiking Destination|first=Laura|last=Kiniry|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThis steady economic progress has earned Armenia increasing support from international institutions. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD), and other [[Global financial system|international financial institutions]] (IFIs) and foreign countries are extending considerable grants and loans. Loans to Armenia since 1993 exceed $1.1&nbsp;billion. These loans are targeted at reducing the budget deficit and stabilising the currency; developing private businesses; energy; agriculture; food processing; transportation; the health and education sectors; and ongoing rehabilitation in the earthquake zone. The government joined the World Trade Organization on 5 February 2003. But one of the main sources of foreign direct investments remains the Armenian diaspora, which finances major parts of the reconstruction of infrastructure and other public projects. Being a growing democratic state, Armenia also hopes to get more financial aid from the Western World.\n\nA liberal foreign investment law was approved in June 1994, and a law on privatization was adopted in 1997, as well as a program of state property privatization. Continued progress will depend on the ability of the government to strengthen its macroeconomic management, including increasing revenue collection, improving the investment climate, and making strides against corruption.

These priorities are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* Armenian studies, humanities and social sciences;\n* Life sciences;\n* Renewable energy, new energy sources;\n* Advanced technologies, information technologies;\n* Space, Earth sciences, sustainable use of natural resources; and\n* Basic research promoting essential applied research.\nThe Law on the National Academy of Sciences was adopted in May 2011. This law is expected to play a key role in shaping the Armenian innovation system. It allows the National Academy of Sciences to extend its business activities to the commercialization of research results and the creation of spin-offs; it also makes provision for restructuring the National Academy of Sciences by combining institutes involved in closely related research areas into a single body. Three of these new centres are particularly relevant: the Centre for Biotechnology, the Centre for Zoology and Hydro-ecology and the Centre for Organic and Pharmaceutical Chemistry.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe government is focusing its support on selected industrial sectors. More than 20 projects have been cofunded by the State Committee of Science in targeted branches: pharmaceuticals, medicine and biotechnology, agricultural mechanization and machine building, electronics, engineering, chemistry and, in particular, the sphere of information technology.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nOver the past decade, the government has made an effort to encourage science\u2013industry linkages. The Armenian information technology sector has been particularly active: a number of public\u2013private partnerships have been established between companies and universities, in order to give students marketable skills and generate innovative ideas at the interface of science and business.

Artists such as [[Sayat Nova]] are famous due to their influence in the development of Armenian folk music. One of the oldest types of Armenian music is the [[Armenian chant]] which is the most common kind of religious music in Armenia. Many of these chants are ancient in origin, extending to pre-Christian times, while others are relatively modern, including several composed by Saint Mesrop Mashtots, the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Whilst under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule, the Armenian classical music composer [[Aram Khatchaturian]] became internationally well known for his music, for various ballets and the [[Sabre Dance]] from his composition for the ballet [[Gayane (ballet)|Gayane]].\n[[File:Armeniapedia dance2.jpg|thumb|Traditional [[Armenian dance]]]]\n\nThe Armenian Genocide caused widespread emigration that led to the settlement of Armenians in various countries in the world. Armenians kept to their traditions and certain diasporans rose to fame with their music. In the post-Genocide Armenian community of the United States, the so-called \"kef\" style Armenian dance music, using Armenian and Middle Eastern folk instruments (often electrified/amplified) and some western instruments, was popular. This style preserved the folk songs and dances of [[Western Armenia]], and many artists also played the contemporary popular songs of Turkey and other Middle Eastern countries from which the Armenians emigrated.\n\n[[Richard Hagopian]] is perhaps the most famous artist of the traditional \"kef\" style and the Vosbikian Band was notable in the 1940s and 1950s for developing their own style of \"kef music\" heavily influenced by the popular American [[Big Band]] Jazz of the time. Later, stemming from the Middle Eastern Armenian diaspora and influenced by Continental European (especially French) pop music, the Armenian pop music genre grew to fame in the 1960s and 1970s with artists such as [[Adiss Harmandian]] and [[Harout Pamboukjian]] performing to the Armenian diaspora and Armenia; also with artists such as [[Sirusho]], performing pop music combined with Armenian folk music in today's entertainment industry.\n\nOther Armenian diasporans that rose to fame in classical or international music circles are world-renowned [[List of French-Armenians|French-Armenian]] singer and composer [[Charles Aznavour]], pianist [[Sahan Arzruni]], prominent opera sopranos such as [[Hasmik Papian]] and more recently [[Isabel Bayrakdarian]] and [[Anna Kasyan]]. Certain Armenians settled to sing non-Armenian tunes such as the heavy metal band [[System of a Down]] (which nonetheless often incorporates traditional Armenian instrumentals and styling into their songs) or pop star [[Cher]]. In the Armenian diaspora, [[Armenian Revolutionary Songs|Armenian revolutionary songs]] are popular with the youth. These songs encourage Armenian patriotism and are generally about Armenian history and national heroes.\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Armenian art}}\n{{See also|List of museums in Armenia}}\n[[File:Khachkar-raffi kojian-IMG 0513.JPG|thumb|upright|Ancient Armenian [[Khachkar]]s (cross-stones)]]\n[[Yerevan Vernissage]] (arts and crafts market), close to Republic Square, bustles with hundreds of vendors selling a variety of crafts on weekends and Wednesdays (though the selection is much reduced mid-week). The market offers woodcarving, antiques, fine lace, and the hand-knotted wool carpets and kilims that are a Caucasus speciality. [[Obsidian]], which is found locally, is crafted into assortment of jewellery and ornamental objects. Armenian gold smithery enjoys a long tradition, populating one corner of the market with a selection of gold items. Soviet relics and souvenirs of recent Russian manufacture \u2013 nesting dolls, watches, enamel boxes and so on \u2013 are also available at the Vernisage.\n\n[[File:Zabel return.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Isabella, Queen of Armenia|Queen Zabel]]\u2019s Return to the Palace'', [[Vardges Sureniants]], (1909)]]\n\nAcross from the Opera House, a popular art market fills another city park on the weekends. Armenia\u2019s long history as a crossroads of the [[ancient history|ancient world]] has resulted in a landscape with innumerable fascinating [[archaeological site]]s to explore. [[Middle Ages|Medieval]], [[Iron Age]], [[Bronze Age]] and even [[Stone Age]] sites are all within a few hours drive from the city. All but the most spectacular remain virtually undiscovered, allowing visitors to view churches and fortresses in their original settings.\n\nThe National Art Gallery in Yerevan has more than 16,000 works that date back to the [[Middle Ages]], which indicate Armenia's rich tales and stories of the times. It houses paintings by many [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] masters as well. The Modern Art Museum, the Children\u2019s Picture Gallery, and the [[Martiros Saryan]] Museum are only a few of the other noteworthy collections of fine art on display in Yerevan. Moreover, many private galleries are in operation, with many more opening every year, featuring rotating exhibitions and sales.\n\nOn 13 April 2013, the Armenian government announced a change in law to allow [[freedom of panorama]] for 3D works of art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.am/legislation.php?sel=show&ID=4717 |title=Legislation: National Assembly of RA |publisher=Parliament.am |date= |accessdate=26 April 2013}}</ref>\n{{clearleft}}\n\n===Cinema===\n{{Main|Cinema of Armenia}}\nCinema in Armenia was born on April 16, 1923, when the Armenian State Committee of Cinema was established by a decree of the Soviet Armenian government.\n\nHowever, the first Armenian film with Armenian subject called \"Haykakan Sinema\" was produced earlier in 1912 in [[Cairo]] by Armenian-Egyptian publisher Vahan Zartarian. The film was premiered in Cairo on March 13, 1913.<ref>Armenian Cinema 100, by [[Artsvi Bakhchinyan]], Yerevan, 2012, pp. 111\u2013112</ref>\n\nIn March 1924, the first Armenian film studio; ''[[Armenfilm]]'' ({{lang-hy|\u0540\u0561\u0575\u0586\u056b\u056c\u0574}} \"Hayfilm,\" {{lang-ru|\u0410\u0440\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e}} \"Armenkino\") was established in Yerevan, starting with a [[documentary film]] called ''Soviet Armenia''.\n\n''[[Namus (film)|Namus]]'' was the first Armenian [[silent film|silent]] [[black-and-white]] film, directed by [[Hamo Beknazarian]] in 1925, based on a play of [[Alexander Shirvanzade]], describing the ill fate of two lovers, who were engaged by their families to each other since childhood, but because of violations of ''[[namus]]'' (a tradition of honor), the girl was married by her father to another person. The first [[sound film]], ''[[Pepo (film)|Pepo]]'' was shot in 1935 and directed by [[Hamo Beknazarian]].\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Armenia|Chess in Armenia}}\n[[File:Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports complex.jpg|thumb|The Tsaghkadzor Olympic Sports complex]]\n[[File:Ireland Armenia teams.jpg|thumb|The [[Armenia national football team]] in Dublin, Ireland]]\n\nA wide array of sports are played in Armenia, the most popular among them being wrestling, weightlifting, judo, association football, chess, and boxing. Armenia's mountainous terrain provides great opportunities for the practice of sports like skiing and climbing. Being a landlocked country, water sports can only be practised on lakes, notably [[Lake Sevan]]. Competitively, Armenia has been successful in chess, weightlifting and wrestling at the international level. Armenia is also an active member of the international sports community, with full membership in the Union of European Football Associations ([[UEFA]]) and International Ice Hockey Federation ([[IIHF]]). It also hosts the [[Pan-Armenian Games]].\n\nPrior to 1992, Armenians would participate in the Olympics representing the USSR. As part of the Soviet Union, Armenia was very successful, winning plenty of medals and helping the USSR win the medal standings at the Olympics on numerous occasions. The first medal won by an Armenian in modern Olympic history was by [[Hrant Shahinyan]] (sometimes spelled as Grant Shaginyan), who won two golds and two silvers in gymnastics at the [[1952 Summer Olympics]] in Helsinki. To highlight the level of success of Armenians in the Olympics, Shahinyan was quoted as saying:\n\n\"Armenian sportsmen had to outdo their opponents by several notches for the shot at being accepted into any Soviet team. But those difficulties notwithstanding, 90 percent of Armenian athletes on Soviet Olympic teams came back with medals.\"<ref name=\"ArmeniaNow.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.armenianow.com/features/6903/ambassadors_in_sport_independent |title=Ambassadors in Sport?: Independent Armenia far below the glory of Soviet times on the pitch, mat |publisher=[[ArmeniaNow]] |date=15 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nArmenia first participated at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona under a unified CIS team, where it was very successful, winning three golds and one silver in weightlifting, wrestling and sharp shooting, despite only having five athletes. Since the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] in [[Lillehammer]], Armenia has participated as an independent nation.\n\nArmenia participates in the Summer Olympic Games in boxing, wrestling, weightlifting, judo, gymnastics, track and field, diving, swimming and sharp shooting. It also participates in the Winter Olympic Games in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and figure skating.\n\n[[File:Levon Aronian 2011.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Chess Grandmaster [[Levon Aronian]] is a [[FIDE]] #2 rated player and the [[Comparison of top chess players throughout history#Elo system|fourth highest rated player in history]]]]\n[[Football in Armenia|Football]] is also popular in Armenia. The most successful team was the [[FC Ararat Yerevan]] team of the 1970s who won the [[Soviet Cup]] in 1973 and 1975 and the [[Soviet Top League 1973|Soviet Top League]] in 1973. The latter achievement saw FC Ararat gain entry to the [[European Cup 1974\u201375|European Cup]] where \u2013 despite a home victory in the second leg \u2013 they lost on aggregate at the quarter final stage to eventual winner [[FC Bayern Munich]]. Armenia competed internationally as part of the [[USSR national football team]] until the [[Armenian national football team]] was formed in 1992 after the split of the Soviet Union. Armenia have never qualified for a major tournament although recent improvements saw the team to achieve 44th position in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] in September 2011. The national team is controlled by the [[Football Federation of Armenia]]. The [[Armenian Premier League]] is the highest level football competition in Armenia, and has been dominated by [[FC Pyunik]] in recent seasons. The league currently consists of eight teams and relegates to the [[Armenian First League]].\n\nArmenia and the Armenian diaspora have produced many successful footballers, including [[Youri Djorkaeff]], [[Alain Boghossian]], [[Andranik Eskandarian]], [[Andranik Teymourian]], [[Edgar Manucharyan]] and [[Nikita Simonyan]]. Djokaeff and Boghossian won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] with [[France national football team|France]], Andranik Teymourian competed in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] for [[Iran national football team|Iran]] and Edgar Manucharyan played in the Dutch [[Eredivisie]] for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]].\n\n[[Wrestling]] has been a successful sport in the Olympics for Armenia. At the [[Armenia at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Armen Nazaryan]] won the gold in the Men's [[Greco-Roman wrestling|Greco-Roman]] Flyweight (52&nbsp;kg) category and [[Armen Mkrtchyan]] won the silver in Men's [[Freestyle wrestling|Freestyle]] Paperweight (48&nbsp;kg) category, securing Armenia's first two medals in its Olympic history.\n\nTraditional Armenian wrestling is called Kokh and practised in traditional garb; it was one of the influences included in the Soviet combat sport of [[Sambo (martial art)|Sambo]], which is also very popular.<ref>{{cite book|last=Green|first=ed. by Thomas A.|title=Martial arts of the world : en encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-1-57607-150-2|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=v32oHSE5t6cC&pg=PA718 718]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Politics of Armenia|government of Armenia]] budgets about $2.8&nbsp;million annually for sports and gives it to the National Committee of Physical Education and Sports, the body that determines which programs should benefit from the funds.<ref name=\"ArmeniaNow.com\"/>\n\nDue to the lack of success lately on the international level, in recent years, Armenia has rebuilt 16 Soviet-era sports schools and furnished them with new equipment for a total cost of $1.9&nbsp;million. The rebuilding of the regional schools was financed by the Armenian government. $9.3&nbsp;million has been invested in the resort town of [[Tsaghkadzor]] to improve the [[winter sport]]s infrastructure because of dismal performances at recent [[winter sport]]s events. In 2005, a cycling centre was opened in [[Yerevan]] with the aim of helping produce world class Armenian cyclists. The government has also promised a cash reward of $700,000 to Armenians who win a gold medal at the Olympics.<ref name=\"ArmeniaNow.com\"/>\n\nArmenia has also been very successful in chess, winning the [[World Team Chess Championship|World Champion]] in 2011 and the [[Chess Olympiad|World Chess Olympiad]] on three occasions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p004j7zg |title=Armenia: the cleverest nation on earth |publisher=[[BBC World Service]] |date=18 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n[[File:Armenian cuisine.jpg|thumb|left|Armenian cuisine]]\n{{Main|Armenian cuisine}}\n\nArmenian cuisine is closely related to eastern and [[Mediterranean cuisine]]; various [[spice]]s, [[vegetable]]s, [[fish]], and [[fruit]]s combine to present unique dishes. The main characteristics of Armenian cuisine are a reliance on the quality of the ingredients rather than heavily spicing food, the use of herbs, the use of wheat in a variety of forms, of legumes, nuts, and fruit (as a main ingredient as well as to sour food), and the stuffing of a wide variety of leaves.\n\nThe [[pomegranate]], with its symbolic association with fertility, represents that nation. The [[apricot]] is the national fruit.\n{{clearleft}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Armenia|Asia|Europe}}\n* [[Outline of Armenia]]\n* [[Index of Armenia-related articles]]\n* {{books-inline|Armenia}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist|25em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n\n| title = UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO Publishing\n| page numbers = 324\u201326\n| source =\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf\n| license statement URL =\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Armenia|Armenia}}\n* [https://www.e-gov.am/en/ Electronic Government of Armenia]\n* [https://armenia.travel/ The official tourism website of Armenia]\n* [https://www.armenianchurch.org/index.jsp?&lng=en The Armenian Church]\n* [http://himnadram.org/ Hayastan All Armenian Fund]\n* {{Twitter}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|am|Armenia}}\n* {{dmoz|Regional/Asia/Armenia}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17398605 Armenia profile] from the [[BBC News]]\n* {{Wikiatlas|Armenia}}\n* [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_CountryProfile.aspx?Country=AM Key Development Forecasts for Armenia] from [[International Futures]]\n* [http://www.armeniapedia.org/wiki/Main_Page Armeniapedia.org]\n\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Articles related to Armenia\n|list=\n{{Armenia topics}}\n{{Armenian nationalism}}\n{{Administrative divisions of Armenia|state=collapsed}}\n{{Cities and towns in Armenia}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in Armenia}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=[[File:Gnome-globe.svg|25px]]{{Spaces}}Geographic locale\n|list=\n{{Countries and regions of the Caucasus}}\n{{Sovereign states of Europe}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=International membership\n|list=\n{{Armenia ties}}\n{{Council of Europe}}\n{{Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)|state=collapsed}}\n{{Eurasian Economic Union (EEU)}}\n{{La Francophonie|state=collapsed}}\n{{Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}}}\n{{National personifications}}\n{{States with limited recognition}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2016}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Armenia| ]]<!--please leave the empty space as standard-->\n[[Category:Transcaucasia]]\n[[Category:Eastern European countries]]\n[[Category:Western Asian countries]]\n[[Category:Landlocked countries]]\n[[Category:Republics]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Council of Europe]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1918]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1920]]\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1920 disestablishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:1920 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1991]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in Asia]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Armenian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Russian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Countries in Asia]]\n[[Category:Countries in Europe]]\n[[Category:Christian states]]"

Malawi''', is a [[landlocked country]] in southeast [[Africa]] that was formerly known as [[Nyasaland]]. It is bordered by [[Zambia]] to the northwest, [[Tanzania]] to the northeast, and [[Mozambique]] on the east, south and west. Malawi is over {{convert|118000|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} with an estimated population of {{UN_Population|Malawi}} (as at July {{UN_Population|Year}}). [[Lake Malawi]] takes up about a third of Malawi's area.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Songs from the Heart, Malawi's amazing birdlife|publisher = Central Africana Limited|year = 2014|isbn = 978-99908-14-33-0|location = |pages = }}</ref> Its capital is [[Lilongwe]], which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is [[Blantyre]], the third is [[Mzuzu]] and the fourth largest is its old capital [[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]]. The name Malawi comes from the [[Maravi]], an old name of the [[Nyanja people]] that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed \"''The Warm Heart of Africa''\"  because of the friendliness of the people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novocmalawi.org/index.php/about/malawi-the-warm-heart-of-africa/|title=Malawi, The Warm Heart of Africa|publisher=Network of Organizations for Vulnerable & Orphan Children|accessdate=26 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727131527/http://www.novocmalawi.org/index.php/about/malawi-the-warm-heart-of-africa/|archivedate=27 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe part of Africa now known as Malawi was settled by [[Bantu expansion|migrating Bantu]] groups around the 10th century. Centuries later in 1891 the area was colonised by the British. In 1953 Malawi, then known as [[Nyasaland]], a [[protectorate]] of the [[United Kingdom]], became a [[protectorate]] within the semi-independent [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]]. The Federation was dissolved in 1963. In 1964 the protectorate over Nyasaland was ended and Nyasaland became an independent country under [[Queen Elizabeth II]] with the new name Malawi. Two years later it became a republic. Upon gaining independence it became a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[one-party state]] under the [[President of Malawi|presidency]] of [[Hastings Banda]], who remained president until 1994. Malawi has a democratic, [[multi-party]] government headed by an elected president, currently [[Arthur Peter Mutharika]]. The country has a [[Malawian Defence Force]] that includes an army, a navy and an air wing. Malawi's foreign policy is [[pro-Western]] and includes positive diplomatic relations with most countries and participation in several [[international organisation]]s, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa]] (COMESA), and the [[African Union]] (AU).\n\nMalawi is among the world's [[List of countries by Human Development Index|least-developed countries]]. The [[Economy of Malawi|economy]] is heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian government depends heavily on outside aid to meet [[economic development|development]] needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, [[environmental protection]], and becoming financially independent amidst widespread unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with a rise in the economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.\n\nMalawi has a low [[life expectancy]] and high [[infant mortality]]. There is a high prevalence of [[HIV/AIDS]], which is a drain on the labour force and government expenditures. There is a diverse population of [[native people]]s, [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]], with several languages spoken and an array of religious beliefs. Although there was periodic regional conflict fuelled in part by ethnic divisions in the past, by 2008 it had diminished considerably and the concept of a Malawian nationality had reemerged.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Malawi}}\n[[File:Chongoni Rock-Art Area-110124.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chongoni Rock Art Area]].]]\nThe area of Africa now known as Malawi had a very small population of [[hunter-gatherer]]s before waves of [[Bantu peoples]] began emigrating from the north around the 10th century.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Although most of the Bantu peoples continued south, some remained permanently and founded [[ethnic group]]s based on common ancestry.<ref name=\"Cutter142\">Cutter, ''Africa 2006'', p. 142</ref> By 1500&nbsp;AD, the tribes had established the [[Maravi|Kingdom of Maravi]]  that reached from north of what is now [[Nkhotakota]] to the [[Zambezi River]] and from [[Lake Malawi]] to the [[Luangwa River]] in what is now [[Zambia]].<ref name=\"StateDept\" />\n\nSoon after 1600, with the area mostly united under one native ruler, native tribesmen began encountering, trading with and making alliances with [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] traders and members of the military. By 1700, however, the empire had broken up into areas controlled by many individual ethnic groups.<ref>Davidson, ''Africa in History'', pp. 164\u2013165</ref> The [[Arab slave trade]] reached its height in the mid-\n1800s, when approximately 20,000 people were enslaved and considered to be carried yearly from Nkhotakota to Kilwa where they were sold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5603/ |title=Malawi Slave Routes and Dr. David Livingstone Trail \u2013 UNESCO World Heritage Centre |website=Whc.unesco.org |date=9 July 2015 |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n\nMissionary and explorer [[David Livingstone]] reached Lake Malawi (then Lake Nyasa) in 1859 and identified the [[Shire Highlands]] south of the lake as an area suitable for European settlement. As the result of Livingstone's visit, several Anglican and Presbyterian missions were established in the area in the 1860s and 1870s, the [[African Lakes]] Company Limited was established in 1878 to set up a trade and transport concern working closely with the missions, and a small mission and trading settlement was established at [[Blantyre]] in 1876 and a British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] took up residence there in 1883. The Portuguese government was also interested in the area so, to prevent Portuguese occupation, the British government sent [[Harry Johnston]] as British consul with instructions to make treaties with local rulers beyond Portuguese jurisdiction.<ref>John G Pike, (1969).

The administrators were given a budget of \u00a310,000 (1891 nominal value) per year, which was enough to employ ten European civilians, two military officers, seventy [[Punjab region|Punjab]] [[Sikhs]] and eighty-five [[Zanzibar]] [[porter (carrier)|porters]]. These few employees were then expected to administer and police a territory of around 94,000&nbsp;square kilometres with between one and two million people.<ref>Reader, ''Africa'', p. 579</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the [[Nyasaland African Congress]] (NAC) was formed by the Africans of Nyasaland to promote local interests to the British government.<ref>Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. 28</ref> In 1953, Britain linked Nyasaland with Northern and Southern [[Rhodesia]] in what was the [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland]], often called the Central African Federation (CAF),<ref name=CA/> for mainly political reasons.<ref>Murphy, ''Central Africa'', p. li</ref> Even though the Federation was semi-independent, the linking provoked opposition from African nationalists, and the NAC gained popular support. An influential opponent of the CAF was Dr. [[Hastings Banda]], a European-trained doctor working in [[Ghana]] who was persuaded to return to Nyasaland in 1958 to assist the nationalist cause. Banda was elected president of the NAC and worked to mobilise nationalist sentiment before being jailed by colonial authorities in 1959. He was released in 1960 and asked to help draft a new constitution for Nyasaland, with a clause granting Africans the majority in the colony's Legislative Council.<ref name=\"Cutter142\" />\n\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-165-9.jpg|thumb|Malawi's first Prime Minister and later [[President for Life]], [[Hastings Banda]] (left), with Tanzania's President [[Julius Nyerere]]]]\n\nIn 1961, Banda's [[Malawi Congress Party]] (MCP) gained a majority in the [[Nyasaland general election, 1961|Legislative Council elections]] and Banda became [[Prime Minister of Malawi|Prime Minister]] in 1963. The Federation was dissolved in 1963, and on 6 July 1964, Nyasaland became independent from British rule and renamed itself Malawi. Under a new constitution, Malawi became a republic with Banda as its first president. The new document also formally made Malawi a [[one-party state]] with the MCP as the only legal party. In 1971, Banda was declared [[president-for-life]]. For almost 30 years, Banda presided over a rigidly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regime, which ensured that Malawi did not suffer armed conflict.<ref name=\"Cutter143\">Cutter, ''Africa 2006'', p. 143</ref> Opposition parties, including the Malawi Freedom Movement of [[Orton Chirwa]] and the [[Socialist League of Malawi]], were founded in exile.\n\nMalawi's economy while Banda was president was often cited as an example of how a poor, landlocked, heavily populated, mineral-poor country could achieve progress in both agriculture and industrial development.<ref>Meredith, ''The Fate of Africa'', p. 285</ref> While in office, and using his control of the country, Banda constructed a business empire that eventually produced one-third of the country's GDP and employed 10% of the wage-earning workforce.<ref>Meredith, ''The Fate of Africa'', p. 380</ref> All money earned by Banda was ploughed back into developing Malawi{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} and was symbolised by the building of a top boarding school called [[Kamuzu Academy]] ([[Eton College|Eton]] of Africa). In Banda's own words \"''I do not want my boys and girls to do what I had to do \u2014 to leave their homes and their families and go away from Malawi to get an education''\", was the reason for gifting this school to Malawi.\n\nUnder pressure for increased [[political freedom]], Banda agreed to a [[Malawian democracy referendum, 1993|referendum]] in 1993, where the populace voted for a [[multi-party democracy]]. In late 1993 a presidential council was formed, the life presidency was abolished and a new constitution was put into place, effectively ending the MCP's rule.<ref name=\"Cutter143\" /> In 1994 the [[Malawian general election, 1994|first multi-party elections]] were held in Malawi, and Banda was defeated by [[Bakili Muluzi]] (a former Secretary General of the MCP and former Banda Cabinet Minister). Re-elected in 1999, Muluzi remained president until 2004, when Dr. [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] was [[Malawian general election, 2004|elected]].

Malawi maintained close [[Malawi\u2013South Africa relations|relations with South Africa]] throughout the [[Apartheid in South Africa|Apartheid]] era, which strained Malawi's relationships with other African countries. Following the collapse of apartheid in 1994, diplomatic relationships were made and maintained into 2011 between Malawi and all other African countries. In 2010, however, Malawi's relationship with Mozambique became strained, partially due to disputes over the use of the Zambezi River and an inter-country electrical grid.<ref name=\"StateDept\" /> In 2007, Malawi established diplomatic ties with China, and Chinese investment in the country has continued to increase since then, despite concerns regarding treatment of workers by Chinese companies and competition of Chinese business with local companies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2011/may/07/china-puts-mark-malawi-presence|title= China puts its mark on Malawi|date=7 May 2011|author=Ngozo, Claire|accessdate=20 July 2011|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> In 2011, relations between Malawi and the United Kingdom were damaged when a document was released in which the British ambassador to Malawi criticised President Mutharika.

The country's strong reliance on tobacco places a heavy burden on the economy as world prices decline and the international community increases pressure to limit tobacco production. Malawi's dependence on tobacco is growing, with the product jumping from 53% to 70% of export revenues between 2007 and 2008. The country also relies heavily on tea, sugar and coffee, with these three plus tobacco making up more than 90% of Malawi's export revenue.<ref name=\"CIA\" /><ref name=\"Africa08\" /> Because of a rise in costs and a decline in sales prices, Malawi is encouraging farmers away from tobacco towards more profitable crops, including spices such as [[paprika]]. The move away from tobacco is further fueled by likely World Health Organization moves against the particular type of tobacco that Malawi produces, burley leaf.

The ''National Science and Technology Policy'' of 2002 envisaged the establishment of a National Commission for Science and Technology to advise the government and other stakeholders on science and technology-led development. Although the Science and Technology Act of 2003 made provision for the creation of this commission, it only became operational in 2011, with a secretariat resulting from the merger of the Department of Science and Technology and the National Research Council. The Science and Technology Act of 2003 also established a Science and Technology Fund to finance research and studies through government grants and loans but, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}, this was not yet operational. The Secretariat of the National Commission for Science and Technology has reviewed the ''Strategic Plan for Science, Technology and Innovation'' (2011\u20132015) but, as of early 2015, the revised policy had not yet met with Cabinet approval.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMalawi is conscious of the need to attract more foreign investment to foster technology transfer, develop human capital and empower the private sector to drive economic growth. In 2012, most foreign investment flowed to infrastructure (62%) and the energy sector (33%).

Production facilities are to be established for a wide range of products within the three selected clusters: oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi's exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; it also helps companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country's Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund is a competitive facility, through which businesses in Malawi's agricultural and manufacturing sectors can apply for grant funding for innovative projects with potential for making a strong social impact and helping the country to diversify its narrow range of exports.

It provides a matching grant of up to 50% to innovative business projects to help absorb some of the commercial risk in triggering innovation. This support should speed up the implementation of new business models and/or the adoption of technologies.

As a result, attendance rates for all children have improved, with enrollment rates for primary schools up from 58% in 1992 to 75% in 2007. Also, the percentage of students who begin standard one and complete standard five has increased from 64% in 1992 to 86% in 2006. Youth literacy has also increased, moving from 68% in 2000 to 82% in 2007. This increase is primarily attributed to improved learning materials in schools, better infrastructure and feeding programs that have been implemented throughout the school system.<ref name=UNDP/> [[File:Public expenditure on education in Southern Africa as a share of GDP, 2012 or closest year.svg|link= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Public_expenditure_on_education_in_Southern_Africa_as_a_share_of_GDP,_2012_or_closest_year.svg|thumb|Public expenditure on education in Southern Africa as a share of GDP, 2012 or closest year.<ref name=\"Web\"/>]] However, attendance in secondary school falls to approximately 25%, with attendance rates being slightly higher for males.<ref name=Furlong>{{cite book|last1=Furlong|first1=Andy|title=Youth Studies: An Introduction|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=USA|isbn=978-0-415-56479-3|page=233}}</ref><ref name=U.N.>{{cite web|title=The world youth report: youth and climate change|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unyin/documents/WYR2010Final%20online%20version.pdf|website=United Nations|accessdate=17 January 2012}}</ref> Dropout rates are higher for girls than boys,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/Malawi.htm|title=Malawi|accessdate=6 October 2008|publisher=Bureau of International Labor Affairs, US Dept. of Labor|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006092319/http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/TDA2001/malawi.htm|archivedate=6 October 2008}}</ref> attributed to security problems during long walks to school, as girls face a higher prevalence of gender-based violence. \n\nEducation in Malawi comprises eight years of primary education, four years of secondary school and four years of university. There are four public universities in Malawi: [[Mzuzu University]] (MZUNI), Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), the [[University of Malawi]] (UNIMA) and [[Malawi University of Science and Technology]]. There are also private universities, such as Livingstonia, Malawi Lakeview, Catholic University of Malawi, Central Christian University, African Bible College, UNICAF University, and MIM.

It consists of army, navy and air force elements. The Malawi army originated from [[British Army|British colonial units]] formed before independence, and is now made up of two rifle regiments and one parachute regiment. The Malawi Air Force was established with German help in 1976, and operates a small number of transport aircraft and multi-purpose helicopters. The Malawian Navy has 3 vessels operating on Lake Malawi, based in [[Monkey Bay]].<ref name=\"Turner22\">Turner, ''The Statesman's Yearbook'', p. 822</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Malawi n3.jpg|thumb|upright|A Malawian man playing a [[xylophone]]]]\n\n{{See also|Music of Malawi|Malawian cuisine}}\n\nThe name \"Malawi\" comes from the [[Maravi]], a [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] people who emigrated from the southern [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] around 1400&nbsp;AD. Upon reaching northern Lake Malawi, the group divided, with one group moving south down the west bank of the lake to become the group known as the [[Chewa people|Chewa]], while the other group, the ancestors of today's Nyanja, moved along the east side of the lake to the southern section of Malawi. Ethnic conflict and continuing migration prevented the formation of a society that was uniquely and cohesively Malawian until the dawn of the 20th&nbsp;century. Over the past century, ethnic distinctions have diminished to the point where there is no significant inter-ethnic friction, although regional divisions still occur. The concept of a Malawian nationality has begun to form around a predominantly rural people who are generally conservative and traditionally nonviolent. The \"Warm Heart of Africa\" nickname is not due to the hot weather of the country, but due to the kind, loving nature of the Malawian people.<ref name=\"StateDept\" />\n\nFrom 1964\u20132010, and again since 2012, the [[Flag of Malawi]] is made up of three equal horizontal stripes of black, red and green with a red rising sun superimposed in the center of the black stripe.

[[Wood carving]] and [[oil painting]] are also popular in more urban centres, with many of the items produced being sold to tourists.

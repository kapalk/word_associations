This has polarized political alliances and threatens the viability of the new state. This paper explains the ideological divisions and the history of rivalry between these two key political actors. The adoption of Marxism by Fretilin in 1977 led to Gusm\u00e3o's repudiation of the party in the 1980s and his decision to remove Falintil, the guerrilla movement, from Fretilin control. The power struggle between the two leaders is then examined in the transition to independence. This includes an account of the politicization of the defense and police forces and attempts by Minister of Internal Administration Rog\u00e9rio Lobato to use disaffected Falintil veterans as a counterforce to the Gusm\u00e3o loyalists in the army. The December 4, 2002, Dili riots are explained in the context of this political struggle.|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"SpL\">{{cite journal|last1=Neto|first1=Oct\u00e1vio Amorim|last2=Lobo|first2=Marina Costa|year=2010|title=Between Constitutional Diffusion and Local Politics: Semi-Presidentialism in Portuguese-Speaking Countries|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1666842_code1512429.pdf|journal=APSA 2010 Annual Meeting Paper|ssrn=1644026|accessdate=25 August 2017|ref=harv}}</ref><ref name=\"InstET\">{{cite book|last=Beuman|first=Lydia M.|year=2016|title=Political Institutions in East Timor: Semi-Presidentialism and Democratisation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8GCFCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover|location=Abingdon, Oxon|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-1317362128|lccn=2015036590|oclc=983148216|accessdate=18 August 2017|via=Google Books|quote=}}</ref>\n| leader_title1 = [[President of East Timor|President]]\n| leader_name1 = [[Francisco Guterres]]\n| leader_title2 = [[Prime Minister of East Timor|Prime Minister]]\n| leader_name2 = [[Taur Matan Ruak]]\n| legislature = [[National Parliament of East Timor|National Parliament]]\n| sovereignty_type = [[History of East Timor|Formation]]\n| established_event1 = [[Portuguese Timor]]\n| established_date1 = 16th century\n| established_event2 = Independence declared\n| established_date2 = 28 November 1975\n| established_event3 = [[East Timor (province)|Annexation by Indonesia]]\n| established_date3 = 17 July 1976\n| established_event4 = Administered by [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor|UNTAET]]\n| established_date4 = 25 October 1999\n| established_event5 = Independence restored\n| established_date5 = 20 May 2002\n| area_km2 = 15,410 <ref name=\"auto\">[http://www.mne.gov.tl/] {{dead link|date=January 2018}}</ref>\n| area_rank = 154th <!-- Area rank should match [[List of countries and dependencies by area]] -->\n| area_sq_mi = 5,743 <!--Do not remove per [[WP:MOSNUM]]-->\n| percent_water = negligible\n| population_census = 1,167,242<ref name=\"census\">{{cite web|url=https://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=13777&lang=en|title=2015 Census shows population growth moderating|date=25 October 2015|accessdate=24 July 2016|publisher=Government of Timor-Leste|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207232321/http://timor-leste.gov.tl/?p=13777&lang=en|archivedate=7 February 2016|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n| population_census_year = 2015\n| population_density_km2 = 78\n| population_density_sq_mi = 203 <!--Do not remove per [[WP:MOSNUM]]-->\n| GDP_PPP = {{nowrap|$4.567 billion<ref name=\"WB\" />}}\n| GDP_PPP_year = 2017\n| GDP_PPP_rank = \n| GDP_PPP_per_capita = $5,479<ref name=\"WB\" />\n| GDP_PPP_per_capita_rank = 148th\n| GDP_nominal = {{nowrap|$2.498 billion<ref name=\"WB\">{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/country/timor-leste?display=graph|title=Timor-Leste|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref>}}\n| GDP_nominal_year = 2014\n| GDP_nominal_per_capita = $3,330<ref name=\"WB\" />\n| Gini = <!--number only-->\n| Gini_year = \n| Gini_change = <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| Gini_ref = \n| Gini_rank = \n| HDI = 0.625<!--number only-->\n| HDI_year = 2017<!-- Please use the year to which the data refers, not the publication year-->\n| HDI_change = increase <!--increase/decrease/steady-->\n| HDI_ref = <ref name=\"HDI\">{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2018_human_development_statistical_update.pdf|title=Human Development Indices and Indicators: 2018 Statistical update|publisher=United Nations Development Programme|date=15 September 2018|accessdate=15 September 2018}}</ref>\n| HDI_rank = 132nd\n| currency = [[United States dollar]]<sup>b</sup>\n| currency_code = USD\n| time_zone = \n| utc_offset = +9\n| utc_offset_DST = \n| time_zone_DST = \n| drives_on = left\n| calling_code = [[+670]]\n| iso3166code = TL\n| cctld = [[.tl]]<sup>c</sup>\n| footnote_a = Fifteen further \"national languages\" are recognised by the Constitution.\n<!----ORPHANED:\n|footnote_ = [[Indonesia]] invaded East Timor on 7 December 1975 and left in 1999.\n|footnote_ = Defined as a restoration by the Constitution.\n ----->| footnote_b = [[East Timor centavo coins|Centavo coins]] also used.\n| footnote_c = [[.tp]] has been phased out.\n| country_code = \n| official_website = [http://timor-leste.gov.tl/ timor-leste.gov.tl]\n}}\n<!-- NOTE: Please do not change the lead sentence without consulting the talk page first.

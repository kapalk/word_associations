It is bordered by [[Latvia]] to the north, [[Belarus]] to the east and south, [[Poland]] to the south, and [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] (a [[Russia]]n [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]]) to the southwest. Lithuania has an estimated population of 2.8 million people {{As of|2019|lc=y}}, and its capital and largest city is [[Vilnius]]. Other major cities are [[Kaunas]] and [[Klaip\u0117da]]. [[Lithuanians]] are [[Baltic people]]. The official language, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], along with [[Latvian language|Latvian]], is one of only two living languages in the [[Baltic languages|Baltic branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family.\n\nFor centuries, the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea were inhabited by various [[Balts|Baltic tribes]]. In the 1230s, the Lithuanian lands were united by [[Mindaugas]], the King of Lithuania, and the first unified Lithuanian state, the [[Kingdom of Lithuania]], was created on 6 July 1253. During the 14th century, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] was the largest country in Europe; present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, and parts of Poland and Russia were the territories of the Grand Duchy. With the [[Lublin Union]] of 1569, Lithuania and Poland formed a voluntary two-state [[personal union]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Commonwealth lasted more than two centuries, until neighbouring countries [[Partitions of Poland|systematically dismantled]] it from 1772 to 1795, with the [[Russian Empire]] annexing most of Lithuania's territory.\n\nAs [[World War I]] neared its end, Lithuania's [[Act of Independence of Lithuania|Act of Independence]] was signed on 16 February 1918, declaring the founding of the modern Republic of Lithuania. In the midst of the [[Second World War]], Lithuania was first [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|occupied by the Soviet Union]] and then by [[Occupation of Lithuania by Nazi Germany|Nazi Germany]]. As World War II neared its end and the Germans retreated, the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1944)|Soviet Union reoccupied Lithuania]].

Due to the lack of reliable evidence, the true meaning of the name is unknown. Nowadays, scholars still debate the meaning of the word and there are a few plausible versions.\n\nSince ''Lietuva'' has a suffix (-''uva''), the original word should have no suffix. A likely candidate is ''Liet\u0101''. Because many [[Baltic language|Baltic]] [[ethnonym]]s originated from [[hydronym]]s, linguists have searched for its origin among local hydronyms.

The growing season lasts 202 days in the western part of the country and 169 days in the eastern part. Severe storms are rare in the eastern part of Lithuania but common in the coastal areas.\n\nThe longest records of measured temperature in the Baltic area cover about 250 years. The data show warm periods during the latter half of the 18th century, and that the 19th century was a relatively cool period.

Among natural ecosystems, forests are particularly important to Lithuania, covering 33% of the country's territory. Wetlands (raised bogs, fens, transitional mires, etc.) cover 7.9% of the country, with 70% of wetlands having been lost due to drainage and peat extraction between 1960 and 1980. Changes in wetland plant communities resulted in the replacement of moss and grass communities by trees and shrubs, and fens not directly affected by land reclamation have become drier as a result of a drop in the water table. There are 29,000 rivers with a total length of 64,000&nbsp;km in Lithuania, the [[Nemunas River]] basin occupying 74% of the territory of the country. Due to the construction of dams, approximately 70% of spawning sites of potential catadromous fish species have disappeared.

Habitat deterioration is occurring in regions with very productive and expensive lands as crop areas are expanded. Currently, 18.9% of all plant species, including 1.87% of all known fungi species and 31% of all known species of lichens, are listed in the [[List of extinct and endangered species of Lithuania|Lithuanian Red Data Book]]. The list also contains 8% of all fish species.<ref name=\"cbd\"/>\n\nThe wildlife populations have rebounded as the hunting became more restricted and urbanization allowed replanting forests (forests already tripled in size since their lows). Currently, Lithuania has approximately 250,000 larger wild animals or 5 per each square kilometer. The most prolific large wild animal in every part of Lithuania is the [[roe deer]], with 120,000 of them. They are followed by [[boar]]s (55,000). Other ungulates are the [[deer]] (~22,000), [[fallow-deer]] (~21,000) and the largest one: [[moose]] (~7,000). Among the Lithuanian predators, [[fox]]es are the most common (~27,000). [[Wolve]]s are, however, more ingrained into the mythology as there are just 800 in Lithuania. Even rarer are the [[lynx]]es (~200). The large animals mentioned above exclude the [[rabbit]], ~200,000 of which may live in the Lithuanian forests.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fauna of Lithuania|url=http://www.truelithuania.com/tag/fauna-of-lithuania|website=TrueLithuania.com|accessdate=24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Lithuania}}\n\n===Government===\n{{Main|Government of Lithuania}}\n[[File:Seimas litauensparlament.jpg|thumb|left|[[Seimas]] \u2014 (Parliament of Lithuania)]]\nSince Lithuania declared the restoration of its independence on 11 March 1990, it has maintained strong democratic traditions.

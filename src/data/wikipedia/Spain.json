Phoenician influence expanded as much of the Peninsula was eventually incorporated into the [[Carthaginian Empire]], becoming a major theatre of the [[Punic Wars]] against the expanding [[Roman Empire]]. After an [[Roman conquest of Hispania|arduous conquest]], the peninsula came fully under Roman Rule. During the early Middle Ages it came under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Gothic]] rule but later, much of it was conquered by Muslim invaders from North Africa. In a process that took centuries, the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula. The last Muslim state fell in the same year Columbus reached the Americas. A global empire began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for a century and a half, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries.\n\nContinued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status. The Napoleonic invasions of Spain led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable. Prior to the Second World War, Spain suffered a devastating civil war and came under the rule of an authoritarian government, which oversaw a period of stagnation that was followed by a surge in the growth of the economy. Eventually democracy was peacefully restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century, that started a new globalised world with economic and ecological challenges.\n\n=== Prehistory and pre-Roman peoples ===\n{{Main|Prehistoric Iberia}}\n[[File:Greek and Phoenician Colonies in The Iberian Peninsula.png|thumb|Pre-Roman map of The Iberian Peninsula]]\nArchaeological research at [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]] indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by [[hominid]]s 1.2&nbsp;million years ago.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6256356.stm|title='First west Europe tooth' found|publisher=BBC|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=9 August 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwqnGivb?url=http://encarta.msn.com/text_761575057___0/Spain.html|archivedate=1 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In [[Atapuerca Mountains|Atapuerca]] fossils have been found of the earliest known [[hominins]] in Europe, the [[Homo antecessor]].

These tribes had crossed the [[Rhine]] in early 407 and ravaged [[Gaul]].

As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture.\n\n[[File:Alcazar of Toledo - Toledo, Spain - Dec 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], capital of the Visigothic Kingdom]]\nThe [[Byzantine]]s established an occidental province, [[Spania]], in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under [[Visigothic Kingdom|Visigothic rule]]. These [[Visigoths]], or Western Goths, after [[Sack of Rome (410)|sacking Rome]] under the leadership of [[Alaric I|Alaric]] (410), turned towards the [[Iberian Peninsula]], with [[Athaulf]] for their leader, and occupied the northeastern portion. [[Wallia]] extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia. [[Theodoric I]] took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the [[Battle of the Catalaunian Plains]], where [[Attila]] was routed. [[Euric]] (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia. Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths. In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman Catholics against the Arianism of the Visigoths, and in the [[Franco-Visigothic Wars|wars]] which ensued [[Alaric II]] and [[Amalaric]] lost their lives.\n\n[[Athanagild]], having risen against King [[Agila]], called in the Byzantines and, in payment for the succour they gave him, ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast (554). [[Liuvigild]] restored the political unity of the peninsula, subduing the Suebians, but the religious divisions of the country, reaching even the royal family, brought on a civil war. [[St. Hermengild]], the king's son, putting himself at the head of the Catholics, was defeated and taken prisoner, and suffered martyrdom for rejecting communion with the Arians. [[Recared]], son of Liuvigild and brother of St. Hermengild, added religious unity to the political unity achieved by his father, accepting the Catholic faith in the [[Third Council of Toledo]] (589). The religious unity established by this council was the basis of that fusion of Goths with Hispano-Romans which produced the Spanish nation.

By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]].\n\n[[File:Barcelona, proclamaci\u00f3n de la rep\u00fablica, aspecto de la plaza de San Jaime en la ma\u00f1ana del 21 de febrero, de Pellicer.jpg|thumb|left|Proclamation of the [[First Spanish Republic]] in Barcelona, 1873. [[Francesc Pi i Margall]], was president and intellectual theoric of [[federalism]].]]\n\nThe Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s Anti-liberal forces known as [[Carlism|Carlists]] fought against liberals in the [[Carlist Wars]]. Liberal forces won, but the conflict between progressive and conservative liberals ended in a weak early constitutional period. After the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]] of 1868 and the short-lived [[First Spanish Republic]], a more stable [[Restoration (Spain)|monarchic period began]] characterised by the practice of ''turnismo'' (the rotation of government control between progressive and conservative liberals within the Spanish government).\n\n[[File:Semana tragica.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in Barcelona after the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Tragic Week]] events]]\n\nIn the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the [[Cuban War of Independence]] and the [[Philippine Revolution]] broke out and eventually<!--For whatever reasons; it is not for here to go into long explanations!--> the United States became involved. The [[Spanish\u2013American War]] was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. ''El Desastre'' (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the [[Generation of '98]] who were conducting an analysis of the country.\n\nAlthough the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little peace; Spain played a minor part in the [[scramble for Africa]], with the colonisation of [[Western Sahara]], [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]. It remained neutral during World War I (see [[Spain in World War I]]). The heavy losses suffered during the [[Rif War (1920)|Rif War]] in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.\n\n=== Second Spanish Republic ===\n{{Main|Second Spanish Republic}}\n[[File:Arrested workers during the Asturian Revolution, 1934.jpg|thumb|Arrested workers during the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]].]]\nAfter a period of authoritarian rule under General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] (1923\u20131931), the king determined to seek a solution to the political situation and establish the Constitution, the king led the municipal elections on 12 April 1931. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, while the total number of councillors was mostly monarchical. The organised demonstrations demanding the establishment of a democratic republic led the king to leave the country and the proclamation of the same on 14 April of that same year. During the [[Second Spanish Republic|Second Republic]] there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. The moderate leaders were boycotted and each party intended to create a Spain to suit them. During the first two years, governed a coalition of republican and socialist parties. In the elections held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. The violent acts during this period included the burning of churches, the [[Sanjurjada|monarchical uprising of the militar Jos\u00e9 Sanjurjo]], the [[Revolution of 1934]] and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms are initiated to modernise the country \u2013 democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, first Statutes of Autonomy ... \u2013 and the rights of citizens as the recognition of [[Women's suffrage|women's right to vote]], establishing [[universal suffrage]].\n\nOn 17 July and 18, 1936, [[Spanish coup of July 1936|revolted]] against the government of the Republic, the military garrisons of the Spanish North Africa, coup d'\u00e9tat that triumphs only in part country. Spain was divided into two zones: one under the authority of the Republican government \u2014 in which the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936|social revolution of 1936]] \u2013 and other [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|controlled by the insurgents]] took place. The situation led to a [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], in which the general [[Francisco Franco]] was sworn in as the supreme leader of the insurgents.\n\n=== Spanish Civil War and Francoist Spain ===\n{{Main|Spanish Civil War|Spanish Revolution of 1936|Francoist Spain}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of [[Guernica]] after [[Bombing of Guernica|bombing]] by the [[Luftwaffe]]]]\n\nThe Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936. For three years the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] forces led by General [[Francisco Franco]] and supported by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]] fought the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] side, which was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], Mexico and [[International Brigades]] but it was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of [[non-intervention]]. The civil war was viciously fought and there were [[Spanish Civil War#Atrocities|many atrocities committed by all sides]]. The [[Spanish Civil War|war]] claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_corrisedrespondent/2809025.stm Spanish Civil War fighters look back], BBC News, 23 February 2003</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |title=Relatives of Spaniards who fled Franco granted citizenship |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 December 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2014 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723074619/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/spain/3998443/Relatives-of-Spaniards-who-fled-Franco-granted-citizenship.html |archivedate=23 July 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1939, General Franco emerged victorious and became a dictator.\n\n[[File:Franco eisenhower 1959 madrid.jpg|thumb|[[Francisco Franco]] and [[Dwight D.

The only legal party under Franco's post civil war regime was the ''[[Falange]] Espa\u00f1ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS'', formed in 1937; the party emphasised [[falangism]], a form of fascism that emphasised [[anti-communism]], nationalism and [[Roman Catholicism]]. Given Franco's opposition to competing political parties, the party was renamed the National Movement (''[[Movimiento Nacional]]'') in 1949.\n\nAfter World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the [[Cold War]] period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. In the 1960s, Spain registered an [[Spanish miracle|unprecedented rate of economic growth]] which was propelled by [[Spanish miracle#Industrialisation|industrialisation]], a [[Spanish miracle#Rural exodus|mass internal migration]] from rural areas to [[Madrid]], [[Barcelona]] and the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the creation of a [[Spanish miracle#Mass tourism|mass tourism industry]].

King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.\n\nDuring the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like [[La Movida Madrile\u00f1a]] and a culture of human rights arose with [[Gregorio Peces-Barba]]. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined [[NATO]], followed by [[Spanish NATO membership referendum, 1986|a referendum]] after a strong social opposition. That year the [[Spanish Socialist Workers Party]] (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years.

It has two varieties: ''Csa'' and ''Csb'' according to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].\n** The ''Csa'' zone is associated to areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout [[Andalusia]], Extremadura and much, if not most, of the centre of the country. The ''Csa'' zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level, reason for which K\u00f6ppen classification is often eschewed within Spain. Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures.\n** The ''Csb'' zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile\u2013Le\u00f3n]], northeastern [[Castilla-La Mancha]] and northern [[Community of Madrid|Madrid]]) and into much rainier areas (notably [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]). Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic.\n* The [[semi-arid climate]] (''BSk'', ''BSh''), is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain. It covers most of the [[Region of Murcia]], southern [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the [[Ebro]] valley, which crosses southern [[Navarre]], central Aragon and western Catalonia. It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and some locations of western Andalusia. The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.\n* The [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region ([[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], Cantabria, [[Asturias]], and partly Galicia and Castile\u2013Le\u00f3n). Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico|Iberian System]] and in the [[Pyrenees|Pyrenean]] valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (''Cfa'') also occurs. Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.\n\nApart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the [[alpine climate]] in areas with very high altitude, the [[humid subtropical climate]] in areas of northeastern Spain and the [[continental climate]]s (''Dfc'', ''Dfb'' / ''Dsc'', ''Dsb'') in the [[Pyrenees]] as well as parts of the [[Cordillera Cant\u00e1brica|Cantabrian Range]], the [[Sistema Central|Central System]], [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] and the [[Sistema Ib\u00e9rico|Iberian System]], and a typical [[desert climate]] (''BWk'', ''BWh'') in the zone of Almer\u00eda, Murcia and eastern [[Canary Islands]]. Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above {{convert|18.0|C|1}} during their coldest month, thus having a [[tropical climate]].\n\n=== Fauna and flora ===\n[[File:Iberian Wolf AdF 001.jpg|thumb|[[Iberian wolf]] in [[Castile and Leon]]. The region has the 25% of the land covered by [[Natura 2000]] protected natural spaces.]]\n\nThe [[fauna]] presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and [[Eurasia]], and the great diversity of habitats and [[biotopes]], the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.\n\nThe vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the relief, the climate and [[latitude]]. Spain includes different [[phytogeographic]] regions, each with its own floristic characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, [[Biotic component|biotic]] factors.\n\n== Politics ==\n{{Main|Politics of Spain}}\n{{See also|Spanish Constitution of 1978}}\n[[File:Palacio Real Jardines.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Royal Palace of Madrid|Royal Palace]] in Madrid]]\n\nAccording to the [[Democracy Index]] of the EIU, Spain is one of the 19 full democracies in the world.\n\nThe Spanish Constitution of 1978 is the culmination of the [[Spanish transition to democracy]].\nThe constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812.

Autonomous communities are divided into provinces, of which there are 50 in total, and in turn, provinces are divided into municipalities. In Catalonia, two additional divisions exist, the ''comarques'' (sing. ''comarca'') and the ''vegueries'' (sing. ''vegueria'') both of which have administrative powers; ''comarques'' being aggregations of municipalities, and the ''vegueries'' being aggregations of ''comarques''. The concept of a ''comarca'' exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions.\n\n==== Autonomous communities ====\n{{Main|Autonomous communities of Spain}}\n{{See also|Nationalities and regions of Spain}}\n{{Autonomous regions of Spain|float=right}}\n\nSpain's autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the \"[[nationalities and regions of Spain|''nationalities'' and regions of Spain]]\".<ref>Article 143 of the 1978 Spanish Constitution in reference to Article 2</ref> The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economical traits. This territorial organisation, based on [[devolution]], is literally known in Spain as the \"State of Autonomies\".\n\nThe basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the [[Statute of Autonomy]]. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Chapter 3.

In turn, provinces are divided into [[municipalities of Spain|municipalities]]. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020151/http://www.constitucion.es/constitucion/lenguas/ingles.html#8 Articles 140 and 141].

The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Spain}}\n[[File:Cumbre del G20 en Los Cabos, M\u00e9xico.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mariano Rajoy]] in a G-20 Summit in Mexico.

Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (''secano''), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (''regad\u00edo'') accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in [[Province of Almer\u00eda|Almer\u00eda]]\u2014one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain\u2014of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.\n\n[[File:Vi\u00f1edos en Bri\u00f1as.jpg|thumb|A [[vineyard]] of [[Rioja (wine)|Rioja]]]]\n\nThough only about 17% of Spain's cultivated land was irrigated, it was estimated to be the source of between 40\u201345% of the gross value of crop production and of 50% of the value of agricultural exports. More than half of the irrigated area was planted in [[maize|corn]], [[fruit tree]]s, and vegetables. Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, [[sugar beet]]s, potatoes, [[legume]]s, [[olive tree]]s, mangos, [[strawberries]], tomatoes, and [[fodder]] grasses. Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land.\n\n[[Citrus fruit]]s, vegetables, [[cereal grain]]s, [[olive oil]], and wine\u2014Spain's traditional agricultural products\u2014continued to be important in the 1980s. In 1983 they represented 12%, 12%, 8%, 6%, and 4%, respectively, of the country's agricultural production. Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and [[dairy product]]s. Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983. Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains. Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export. Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did [[sunflower seed oil]] that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the [[European Economic Community|European Community]].\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Spain}}\n[[File:Benidorm vista 04.JPG|thumb|[[Benidorm]], one of Europe's largest coastal tourist destinations]]\n\nIn 2017, Spain was the second most visited country in the world, recording 82 million tourists which marked the fifth consecutive year of record-beating numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lamoncloa.gob.es/lang/en/gobierno/news/Paginas/2018/20180110_balancetourist17.aspx |title=Spain posts record number of 82 million inbound tourists in 2017 |date=10 January 2018 |accessdate=10 February 2018}}</ref> The headquarters of the [[World Tourism Organization]] are located in Madrid.\n\nSpain's geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture, and excellent infrastructure has made the country's international tourist industry among the largest in the world.

Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in [[Spanish Morocco]] and [[Western Sahara]] full citizenship. Their ranks have since been bolstered by recent immigration, especially from Morocco and Algeria.\n\n[[Judaism]] was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country.

Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of the major [[Romance-speaking Europe|Latin countries]] of Europe. Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity. Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music have been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.\n\n=== World Heritage Sites ===\n{{Main|World Heritage Sites in Spain}}\n{{See also|Castles in Spain|Cathedrals in Spain}}\n[[File:Naranco, Iglesia Santa Maria-PM 34664.jpg|thumb|upright= 0.9|The [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|pre-Romanesque]] architecture of [[Santa Mar\u00eda del Naranco]] in Oviedo.]]\n\nAfter Italy (54) and China (52), Spain is the third country in the world with the most [[World Heritage Site]]s.

The Valencian chivalric romance [[Tirant lo Blanch]] written in [[Valencian language|Valencian]] is also remarkable.\n\nOther major plays from the medieval times were ''[[Mester de Juglar\u00eda]]'', ''[[Mester de Clerec\u00eda]]'', ''[[Coplas por la muerte de su padre]]'' or ''[[The Book of Good Love|El Libro de buen amor]]'' (The Book of Good Love).\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]] the major plays are ''[[La Celestina]]'' and ''[[El Lazarillo de Tormes]]'', while many religious literature was created with poets as [[Luis de Le\u00f3n]], [[San Juan de la Cruz]], [[Santa Teresa de Jes\u00fas]], etc.\n\nThe [[Baroque]] is the most important period for Spanish culture. We are in the times of the [[Spanish Empire]]. The famous ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quijote de La Mancha]]'' by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: [[Francisco de Quevedo]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca|Calder\u00f3n de la Barca]] or [[Tirso de Molina]].\n\nDuring the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] we find names such as [[Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn]], [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o]], [[Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos]] or [[Leandro Fern\u00e1ndez de Morat\u00edn]].\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n, en Actualidades.jpg\n| width1    = 150\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Mar\u00eda Zambrano ca. 1918.JPG\n| width2    = 117\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Rodoreda.jpg\n| width3    = 111\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = \n| footer    = [[Emilia Pardo Baz\u00e1n]], [[Mar\u00eda Zambrano]] and [[Merc\u00e8 Rodoreda]]\n| footer_align = left\n}}\nDuring the [[Romanticism]], [[Jos\u00e9 Zorrilla]] created one of the most emblematic figures in European literature in [[Don Juan Tenorio]].

Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'. In the spirit of general \"Realism\", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations.\n\nThe group that has become known as the [[Generation of 1898]] was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain. The \"Disaster\" of 1898 led established writers to seek practical political, economic, and social solutions in essays grouped under the literary heading of ''Regeneracionismo''. For a group of younger writers, among them [[Miguel de Unamuno]], [[P\u00edo Baroja]], and [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ednez Ruiz]] (Azor\u00edn), the Disaster and its cultural repercussions inspired a deeper, more radical literary shift that affected both form and content. These writers, along with [[Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n]], [[Antonio Machado]], [[Ramiro de Maeztu]], and \u00c1ngel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda del Valle Incl\u00e1n, de Audouard.jpg\n| width1    = 129\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Photo of Benito P\u00e9rez Gald\u00f3s.jpg\n| width2    = 88\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca.

The next supposed \"generation\" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology. By the year 1914\u2014the year of the outbreak of the First World War and of the publication of the first major work of the generation's leading voice, [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]]\u2014a number of slightly younger writers had established their own place within the Spanish cultural field.\n\nLeading voices include the poet [[Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez]], the academics and essayists [[Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal]], [[Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n]], [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]], [[Maria Zambrano]], [[Eugeni d'Ors]], [[Clara Campoamor]] and Ortega y Gasset, and the novelists Gabriel Mir\u00f3, [[Ram\u00f3n P\u00e9rez de Ayala]], and [[Ram\u00f3n G\u00f3mez de la Serna]]. While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity. [[Salvador de Madariaga]], another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the [[College of Europe]] and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the [[Liberal International]].\n\nThe Generation of 1927, where poets Pedro Salinas, [[Jorge Guill\u00e9n]], [[Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca]], [[Vicente Aleixandre]], [[D\u00e1maso Alonso]]. All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of ''regeneracionistas'' and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards.\n[[File:Miguel Delibes (d\u00e9cada de 1960) - 4.tif|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Miguel Delibes]] ([[Valle de Sedano]] in 1960), describes the situation of rural Spain after the [[Rural flight]] in the 1950s.]]\nThe two main writers in the second half of the 20th century were the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] laureate [[Camilo Jos\u00e9 Cela]] and [[Miguel Delibes]] from [[Generation of '36]]. Spain is one of the countries with the most number of laureates with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], and with Latin American laureates they made the Spanish language literature one of the most laureates of all.

The Portuguese writer [[Jos\u00e9 Saramago]], also awarded with the prize, lived for many years in Spain and spoke both Portuguese and Spanish. Saramago was also well known by his [[Iberism|Iberist]] ideas.\n\nThe [[Generation of '50]] are also known as the children of the civil war. [[Rosa Chacel]], [[Gloria Fuertes]], [[Jaime Gil de Biedma]], [[Juan Goytisolo]], [[Carmen Mart\u00edn Gaite]], [[Ana Mar\u00eda Matute]], [[Juan Mars\u00e9]], [[Blas de Otero]], [[Gabriel Celaya]], [[Antonio Gamoneda]], [[Rafael S\u00e1nchez Ferlosio]] or [[Ignacio Aldecoa]].\n\n[[Premio Planeta de Novela]] and [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize]] are the two main awards nowadays in Spanish literature.\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Bartolomedelascasas.jpg\n| width1    = 130\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = LuisVives.jpg\n| width2    = 120\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| footer    = [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] and [[Luis Vives]]\n| footer_align = left\n| valign    = middle\n}}\n[[Seneca the Elder|Seneca]] was a philosopher during the time of the [[Roman Empire]].\n\nDuring [[Al-Andalus]], Muslim, Jewish and Christian philosopher flourished.

As well as [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]].\n\n[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Spain arrived later and less strong as in other European countries, but during the [[XIX century]] liberal ideas arrived into Spanish society. At the end of the century, socialist and libertarian ideas also flourished particularly strong at the intellectual level, with thinkers as [[Francisco Pi i Margall]], [[Ricardo Mella]] or [[Francisco Ferrer Guardia]].\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century the most prominent philosophers are [[Maria Zambrano]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset]].\n\nMost contemporary philosophers include [[Fernando Savater]] and [[Adela Cortina]], creator of the term [[aporophobia]].\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Spanish art}}\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Las Meninas, by Diego Vel\u00e1zquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg\n| width1    = 126\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg\n| width2    = 140\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| footer    = ''[[Las Meninas]]'', [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', [[Pablo Picasso]]\n| footer_align = left\n| valign    = middle\n}}\nArtists from Spain have been highly influential in the development of various European and [[Hispanic America|American]] [[art movement|artistic movements]]. Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish and influences in Spain, especially in [[Andalusia]] is still evident today. European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the [[Renaissance]] [[Baroque|Spanish Baroque]] and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] periods. There are many other autochthonous styles such as the [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]], [[Herrerian]] architecture or the [[Isabelline Gothic]].\n\nDuring the [[Golden Age]] we find painters such as [[El Greco]], [[Jos\u00e9 de Ribera]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]] and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]]. Also inside Baroque period [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, like ''[[Las Meninas]]'' or ''[[Las Hilanderas (Vel\u00e1zquez)|Las Hilanderas]]''.\n\n[[Francisco Goya]] painted during a historical period that includes the [[Peninsular War|Spanish Independence War]], the fights between liberals and absolutists, and the raise of contemporary state-nations.\n\n[[Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla]] is a well-known impressionist painter and there are many important Spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement, including [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Salvador Dal\u00ed]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Joan Mir\u00f3]].\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n[[File:Chillida-peine.jpg|thumb|''The Comb of the Wind'' of [[Eduardo Chillida]] in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]]]]\n\nThe Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time. [[Alonso Berruguete]] ([[Valladolid]] School) is called the \"Prince of Spanish sculpture\". His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the [[Cathedral of Toledo]], the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa \u00darsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were [[Bartolom\u00e9 Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez]], [[Diego de Silo\u00e9]], [[Juan de Juni]] and [[Dami\u00e0 Forment|Dami\u00e1n Forment]].\n\nThere were two Schools of special flair and talent: the [[Sevillian school of sculpture|Seville School]], to which [[Juan Mart\u00ednez Monta\u00f1\u00e9s]] belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the [[Granadan school of sculpture|Granada School]], to which [[Alonso Cano]] belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.\n\nOther notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were [[Pedro de Mena]], [[Pedro Rold\u00e1n]] and his daughter [[Luisa Rold\u00e1n]], [[Juan de Mesa]] and [[Pedro Duque Cornejo]].

There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The [[Mud\u00e9jar]] style, from the 12th to 17th centuries, was developed by introducing Arab style motifs, patterns and elements into European architecture.\n\nThe arrival of [[Modernism]] in the academic arena produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in [[Barcelona]], known as [[modernisme]], produced a number of important architects, of which [[Gaud\u00ed]] is one. The [[International Style (architecture)|International style]] was led by groups like [[GATEPAC]]. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in [[contemporary architecture]] and [[:Category:Spanish architects|Spanish architects]] like [[Rafael Moneo]], [[Santiago Calatrava]], [[Ricardo Bofill]] as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.\n\n=== Music and dance ===\n{{Main|Music of Spain}}\n[[File:Belen maya.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Flamenco]] is an Andalusian artistic form that evolved from the [[Seguidilla]].]]\n\nSpanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with [[flamenco]], a West Andalusian musical genre, which, contrary to popular belief, is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of [[folk music]] abound in Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, Castile, the Basque Country, Galicia, Cantabria and Asturias. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.\n\nIn the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]], [[Manuel de Falla]] and [[Enrique Granados]] and singers and performers such as [[Pl\u00e1cido Domingo]], [[Jos\u00e9 Carreras]], [[Montserrat Caball\u00e9]], [[Alicia de Larrocha]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Pablo Casals]], [[Ricardo Vi\u00f1es]], [[Jos\u00e9 Iturbi]], [[Pablo de Sarasate]], [[Jordi Savall]] and [[Teresa Berganza]].

It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country's deep [[Mediterranean]] roots. Spain's extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:\n\n'''''Mediterranean''''' Spain \u2013 all such coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia \u2013 heavy use of seafood, such as ''pesca\u00edto frito'' (fried fish); several cold soups like ''[[gazpacho]]''; and many rice-based dishes like ''[[paella]]'' from Valencia<ref name=\"paella\" /> and ''[[arr\u00f2s negre]]'' (black rice) from Catalonia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |title=Spain Gain at Mercat Negre |work=The Village Voice |date=1 December 2009 |last=DiGregorio |first=Sarah |location=New York |accessdate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208050334/http://www.villagevoice.com/2009-12-01/restaurants/spain-gain-at-mercat-negre/ |archivedate=8 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''''Inner''''' Spain \u2013 Castile \u2013 hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based ''Castilian soup'', along with substantious stews such as ''[[cocido madrile\u00f1o]]''. Food is traditionally conserved by salting, like [[Spanish ham]], or immersed in [[olive oil]], like [[Manchego cheese]].\n\n'''''Atlantic''''' Spain \u2013 the whole Northern coast, including [[Asturian cuisine|Asturian]], [[Basque cuisine|Basque]], [[Cantabrian cuisine|Cantabrian]] and [[Galician cuisine]] \u2013 vegetable and fish-based stews like ''[[caldo gallego]]'' and ''[[marmitako]]''. Also, the lightly cured ''[[Lac\u00f3n Gallego|lac\u00f3n]]'' ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, like the Basque-style [[cod]], [[albacore]] or [[anchovy]] or the Galician octopus-based ''[[polbo \u00e1 feira]]'' and shellfish dishes.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Spain}}\n[[File:Barcelona-1992-rr-800.jpg|thumb|upright|[[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona]]\n\nWhile varieties of football had been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. [[Real Madrid C.F.]] and [[FC Barcelona]] are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. [[Spain national football team|The country's national football team]] won the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], and is the first team to ever win three back-to-back major international tournaments.\n\n[[Basketball]], [[tennis]], cycling, [[team handball|handball]], [[Spain national futsal team|futsal]], [[motorcycling]] and, lately, [[Formula One]] are also important due to the presence of Spanish champions in all these disciplines. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] that were hosted in [[Barcelona]], which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for [[water sports]], [[golf]] and [[skiing]].\n\nThe most outstanding athletes figure: [[Rafael Nadal]] is the leading Spanish tennis player and has won seventeen [[List of Grand Slam men's singles champions|Grand Slam titles]] (second most of any man)<ref>{{cite|url=http://www.tennis-x.com/grand-slam-finals/rafael-nadal.php|title=Rafael Nadal's Grand Slam Titles, Finals, Records|website=tennis-x.com}}</ref> and holds the record with the [[Tennis Masters Series records and statistics#Total titles and finals|most number]] of [[ATP World Tour Masters 1000]] singles titles.<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.atpworldtour.com/en/news/nadal-nishikori-monte-carlo-2018-sunday|title=Nadal Clinches La Und\u00e9cima \u2013 World No. 1 wins historic 11th title in the Principality|author=atpworldtour.com|date=22 April 2018}}</ref> [[Marc M\u00e1rquez]] is the leading Spanish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and is a five-time [[List of 500cc/MotoGP Motorcycle World Champions|MotoGP world champion]].<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/motogp-marc-marquez-youngest-four-time-world-champion-valencia-grand-prix-results-highlights-andrea-a8050891.html|title=Marc Marquez the youngest four-time MotoGP champion after winning title in dramatic Valencia Grand Prix finish|author=Jack de Menezes|date=12 November 2017|work=The Independent}}</ref> [[Carolina Mar\u00edn]] is the leading Spanish [[badminton]] player being one-time Olympic Champion,<ref>{{cite|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/36690971|title=Rio Olympics 2016: Carolina Marin beats India's PV Sindhu in badminton final|date= 19 August 2016|author=BBC}}</ref> three-time World Champion<ref>[http://www.badmintoneurope.com/cms/default.aspx?clubid=4685&m=6425435&cmsid=239&pageid=5381& \"BREAKING: Marin World Champion\"] badmintoneurope.com 6 August 2018</ref> and four-time European Champion.<ref>{{cite|url=https://articles.olympicchannel.com/ole-historic-four-in-a-row-for-carolina-marin-in-hometown-huelva/|title=Ol\u00e9!

Some of them are known worldwide, and every year millions of people from all over the world go to Spain to experience one of these festivals. One of the most famous is [[San Ferm\u00edn]], in [[Pamplona]]. While its most famous event is the ''encierro'', or the [[running of the bulls]], which happens at 8:00&nbsp;am from 7 to 14 July, the week-long celebration involves many other traditional and folkloric events. Its events were central to the plot of The Sun Also Rises, by [[Ernest Hemingway]], which brought it to the general attention of English-speaking people. As a result, it has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.\n\nOther festivals include: [[La Tomatina]] tomato festival in [[Bu\u00f1ol]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], the carnivals in the [[Canary Islands]], the [[Falles]] in [[Valencia]] or the [[Holy Week]] in Andalusia and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Mediterranean|Spain}}\n* [[Outline of Spain]]\n* {{Books-inline|Spain}}{{clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|author=Gates, David|title=The Spanish Ulcer: A History of the Peninsular War|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-306-81083-1|page=20}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|b=no|voy=Spain}}\n<!--Please discuss links on the talk page before adding them to this list \u2013 Remember to read the WP:EL guideline-->\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|sp|Spain}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080821113429/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/spain.htm Spain] from ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* {{dmoz|Regional/Europe/Spain}}\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17941641 Spain] from the [[BBC News]]\n* [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_CountryProfile.aspx?Country=ES Key Development Forecasts for Spain] from [[International Futures]]\n\n;Government\n* [http://administracion.gob.es/pag_Home/index.html?idioma=en#.VN4im-asWSo E-Government portal for Spain]\n\n;Maps\n* {{wikiatlas|Spain}}\n* {{osmrelation-inline|1311341}}\n\n;Tourism\n* [http://www.spain.info/en/ Official tourism portal for Spain]\n\n{{Spain topics}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title     = Articles related to Spain\n|list      =\n{{Sovereign states of Europe}}\n{{Countries and territories bordering the Mediterranean Sea}}\n{{Monarchies}}\n{{Members of the European Union (EU)}}\n{{Council of Europe}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n{{North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)}}\n{{Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Spain| ]]<!--please leave the empty space as standard-->\n[[Category:Countries in Europe]]\n[[Category:Iberian Peninsula]]\n[[Category:Member states of NATO]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Council of Europe]]\n[[Category:Member states of the European Union]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Union for the Mediterranean]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Romance countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Southern European countries]]\n[[Category:Southwestern European countries]]\n[[Category:Spanish monarchy]]\n[[Category:Spanish-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:Countries in Africa]]\n[[Category:North African countries]]"

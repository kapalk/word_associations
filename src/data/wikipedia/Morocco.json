The [[Marinid dynasty|Marinid]] and [[Saadi dynasty|Saadi]] dynasties continued the struggle against foreign domination, allowing Morocco to remain the only northwest African country to avoid [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation. The [[Alaouite dynasty]], which rules to this day, seized power in 1631. In 1912, Morocco was divided into [[French Morocco|French]] and [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish]] protectorates, with an [[Tangier International Zone|international zone in Tangier]]. It regained its independence in 1956, and has since remained comparatively stable and prosperous by regional standards.\n\nMorocco claims the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing territory]] of [[Western Sahara]], formerly [[Spanish Sahara]], as its [[Southern Provinces]]. After Spain [[Madrid Accords|agreed to decolonise the territory]] to Morocco and [[Mauritania]] in 1975, [[Western Sahara War|a guerrilla war]] arose with [[Sahrawi people|local]] forces. Mauritania relinquished [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|its claim]] in 1979, and the war lasted until a cease-fire in 1991. Morocco currently occupies two thirds of the territory, and [[Western Sahara peace process|peace processes]] have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.\n\nThe [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[sovereign state]] of Morocco is a [[constitutional monarchy]] with an elected parliament. The [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the [[Military of Morocco|military]], foreign policy and religious affairs. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the [[Moroccan government|government]], while [[legislature|legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the two chambers of parliament, the [[Assembly of Representatives of Morocco|Assembly of Representatives]] and the [[Assembly of Councillors]]. The king can issue decrees called [[Moroccan Dahir|dahir]]s, which have the force of law. He can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the [[List of heads of government of Morocco|Prime Minister]] and the president of the constitutional court.\n\nMorocco's predominant religion is [[Islam]], and its official languages are [[Arabic]] and [[Berber languages|Berber]]; the latter became an official language in 2011,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R_rpCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA50|title=Libya in the Arab Spring: The Constitutional Discourse since the Fall of Gaddafi|last=Schnelzer|first=Nadine|date=10 November 2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783658113827}}</ref> and was the native language of Morocco before the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Muslim conquest]] in the seventh century C.E.<ref>\nRodd, Francis. \"Kahena, Queen of the Berbers: \"A Sketch of the Arab Invasion of Ifriqiya in the First Century of the Hijra\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, University of London, Vol. 3, No. 4, (1925)</ref> The [[Moroccan dialect]] of Arabic, referred to as ''Darija'', and [[French language|French]] are also widely spoken.

Direct Roman rule became confined to a few coastal cities, such as Septum ([[Ceuta]]) in [[Mauretania Tingitana]] and [[Cherchell]] in [[Mauretania Caesariensis]], by the late 3rd century. The Roman Empire lost its remaining possessions in Mauretania after the area was devastated by the [[Vandals]] in AD 429.

Morocco and the Polisario Front held UN-sponsored talks in New York but failed to come to any agreement. In 2010, security forces stormed a protest camp in the Western Sahara, triggering violent demonstrations in the regional capital [[El Aai\u00fan]].\n\nIn 2002, Morocco and Spain agreed to a US-brokered resolution over the disputed island of Perejil. Spanish troops had taken the normally uninhabited island after Moroccan soldiers landed on it and set up tents and a flag. There were renewed tensions in 2005, as hundreds of African migrants tried to storm the borders of the Spanish enclaves of Melilla and Ceuta. Morocco deported hundreds of the illegal migrants. In 2006, the Spanish Premier Zapatero visited Spanish enclaves. He was the first Spanish leader in 25 years to make an official visit to the territories. The following year, Spanish King [[Juan Carlos I]] visited Ceuta and Melilla, further angering Morocco which demanded control of the enclaves.\n\nDuring the [[2011\u201312 Moroccan protests]], thousands of people rallied in Rabat and other cities calling for political reform and a new constitution curbing the powers of the king. In July 2011, the King won a landslide victory in a referendum on a reformed constitution he had proposed to placate the [[Arab Spring]] protests. Despite the reforms made by Mohammed VI, demonstrators continued to call for deeper reforms. Hundreds took part in a trade union rally in Casablanca in May 2012. Participants accused the government of failing to deliver on reforms.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{main|Geography of Morocco}} \n[[File:Atlas Mountains snow cover.jpg|thumb|[[Toubkal]], the highest peak in Northwest Africa, at {{convert|4167|m|abbr=on|0}}]]\n[[File:Chauen.jpg|thumb|[[Rif]] Mountains in northern Morocco]]\n[[File:Panorama Djebel el Kest.jpg|thumb|A section of the [[Anti-Atlas]] near [[Tafraout]]]]\n[[File:Morocco Atlas 01.jpg|thumb|An old ''[[Cedrus atlantica]]'' tree in the Atlas range]]\nMorocco has a coast by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] that reaches past the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] into the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The Moroccan coastal plains experience remarkably moderate temperatures even in summer, owing to the effect of the cold [[Canary Current]] off its [[Atlantic]] coast.\n\nIn the Rif, Middle and High Atlas Mountains, there exist several different types of climates: Mediterranean along the coastal lowlands, giving way to a humid temperate climate at higher elevations with sufficient moisture to allow for the growth of different species of oaks, moss carpets, junipers, and Atlantic fir which is a royal conifer tree [[Endemism|endemic]] to Morocco. In the valleys, fertile soils and high precipitation allow for the growth of thick and lush forests. Cloud forests can be found in the west of the Rif Mountains and Middle Atlas Mountains. At higher elevations, the climate becomes alpine in character, and can sustain ski resorts.\n\nSoutheast of the Atlas mountains, near the Algerian borders, the climate becomes very dry, with long and hot summers. Extreme heat and low moisture levels are especially pronounced in the lowland regions east of the Atlas range due to the rain shadow effect of the mountain system. The southeastern-most portions of Morocco are very hot, and include portions of the [[Sahara Desert]], where vast swathes of sand dunes and rocky plains are dotted with lush [[Oasis|oases]].\n\nIn contrast to the Sahara region in the south, coastal [[plain]]s are fertile in the central and northern regions of the country, and comprise the backbone of the country's agriculture, in which 95% of the population live. The direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, the proximity to mainland Europe and the long stretched Rif and Atlas mountains are the factors of the rather European-like climate in the northern half of the country. That makes from Morocco a country of contrasts. [[Forest|Forested areas]] cover about 12% of the country while arable land accounts for 18%. Approximately 5% of Moroccan land is irrigated for agricultural use.\n\n[[File:Merzouga sahara.jpg|thumb|Landscape of the [[Erg Chebbi]]]]\n[[File:Djebel Toubkal 01.jpg|thumb|[[Atlas Mountains]]]]\nIn general, apart from the southeast regions (pre-Saharan and desert areas), Morocco's climate and geography are very similar to the Iberian peninsula. Thus we have the following climate zones:\n\n*'''Mediterranean:''' It dominates the coastal Mediterranean regions of the country, along the (500&nbsp;km strip), and some parts of the Atlantic coast. Summers are hot to moderately hot and dry, average highs are between {{convert|29|C|1}} and {{convert|32|C|1}}. Winters are generally mild and wet, daily average temperatures hover around {{convert|9|C|1}} to {{convert|11|C|1}}, and average low are around {{convert|5|C|1}} to {{convert|8|C|1}}, typical to the coastal areas of the west Mediterranean. Annual Precipitation in this area vary from 600\u2013800&nbsp;mm in the west to 350\u2013500&nbsp;mm in the east. Notable cities that fall into this zone are [[Tangier]], [[Tetouan]], [[Al Hoceima]], [[Nador]] and [[Safi, Morocco|Safi]].\n*'''Sub-Mediterranean:''' It influences cities that show Mediterranean characteristics, but remain fairly influenced by other climates owing to their either relative elevation, or direct exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean. We thus have two main influencing climates:\n\n:* ''Oceanic:'' Determined by the cooler summers, where highs are around {{convert|27|C|1}} and in terms of the Essaouira region, are almost always around {{convert|21|C|1}}. The medium daily temperatures can get as low as {{convert|19|C|1}}, while winters are chilly to mild and wet. Annual precipitation varies from 400 to 700&nbsp;mm. Notable cities that fall into this zone are [[Rabat]], [[Casablanca]], [[K\u00e9nitra]], [[Sal\u00e9]] and [[Essaouira]].\n\n:* ''Continental:'' Determined by the bigger gap between highs and lows, that results in hotter summers and colder winters, than found in typical Mediterranean zones. In summer, daily highs can get as high as {{convert|40|C|1}} during heat waves, but usually are between {{convert|32|C|1}} and {{convert|36|C|1}}. However, temperatures drop as the sun sets. Night temperatures usually fall below {{convert|20|C|1}}, and sometimes as low as {{convert|10|C|1}} in mid-summer. Winters are cooler, and can get below the freezing point multiple times between December and February. Also, snow can fall occasionally. F\u00e8s for example registered {{convert|-8|C|1}} in winter 2005. Annual precipitation varies between 500 and 900&nbsp;mm. Notable cities are [[F\u00e8s]], [[Mekn\u00e8s]], [[Chefchaouen]], [[Beni-Mellal]] and [[Taza]].\n\n*'''Continental:''' This type of climate dominates the mountainous regions of the north and central parts of the country, where summers are hot to very hot, with highs between {{convert|32|C|1}} and {{convert|36|C|1}}. Winters on the other hand are cold, and lows usually go beyond the freezing point. And when cold damp air comes to Morocco from the northwest, for a few days, temperatures sometimes get below {{convert|-5|C|1}}. It often snows abundantly in this part of the country. Precipitation varies between 400 and 800&nbsp;mm. Notable cities are [[Khenifra]], [[Imilchil]], [[Midelt]] and [[Azilal]].\n*'''Alpine:''' This type of climate is found in some parts of the Middle Atlas Mountain range and the eastern part of the High Atlas Mountain range. Summers are very warm to moderately hot, and winters are longer, cold and snowy. Precipitation varies between 400 and 1200&nbsp;mm. In summer highs barely go above {{convert|30|C|1}}, and lows are cool and average below {{convert|15|C|1}}. In winters, highs average around {{convert|8|C|1}}, and lows go well below the freezing point. In this part of country, there are many ski resorts, such as Oukaimeden and Mischliefen. Notable cities are [[Ifrane]], [[Azrou]] and [[Boulmane]].\n*'''Semi-arid:''' This type of climate is found in the south of the country and some parts of the east of the country, where rainfall is lower and annual precipitations are between 200 and 350&nbsp;mm. However, one usually finds Mediterranean characteristics in those regions, such as the precipitation pattern and thermal attributes. Notable cities are [[Agadir]], [[Marrakesh]] and [[Oujda]].\n\nSouth of Agadir and east of Jerada near the Algerian borders, arid and desert climate starts to prevail.\n\n'''Note:''' Due to Morocco's proximity to the Sahara desert and the North Sea of the Atlantic Ocean, two phenomena occur to influence the regional seasonal temperatures, either by raising temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when [[sirocco]] blows from the east creating heatwaves, or by lowering temperatures by 7\u20138 degrees Celsius when cold damp air blows from the northwest, creating a coldwave or cold spell. However, these phenomena don't last for more than 2 to 5 days on average.\n\nCountries or regions that share the same climatic characteristics with Morocco are [[California]] (USA), [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Algeria]].\n\n*'''Precipitation:'''\nAnnual rainfall in Morocco is different according to regions. The northwestern parts of the country receive between 500&nbsp;mm and 1200&nbsp;mm, while the northeastern parts receive between 350 and 600&nbsp;mm. North Central Morocco receives between 700&nbsp;mm and up to 3500&nbsp;mm. The area from Casablanca to Essaouira, on the Atlantic coast, receives between 300&nbsp;mm and 500&nbsp;mm. The regions from Essaouira to Agadir receive between 250&nbsp;mm and 400&nbsp;mm. Marrakesh region in the central south receives only 250&nbsp;mm a year. The southeastern regions, basically the driest areas, receive between 100&nbsp;mm and 200&nbsp;mm only, and consist basically of arid and desert lands.\n\nBotanically speaking, Morocco enjoys a great variety of vegetation, from lush large forests of conifer and oak trees typical of the western Mediterranean countries (Morocco, Algeria, Italy, Spain, France and Portugal), to shrubs and acacias further south. This is due to the diversity of climate and the precipitation patterns in the country.\n\nMorocco's weather is one of the most pristine in terms of the four-season experience. Most regions have distinct seasons where summer is usually not spoiled by rain and winter turns wet, snowy and humid with mild, cool to cold temperatures, while spring and fall see warm to mild weather characterised by flowers blooming in spring and falling leaves in autumn. This type of weather has affected the Moroccan culture and behaviour and played a part in the social interaction of the population, like many other countries that fall into this type of climate zone.\n\n===Biodiversity===\n[[File:Portrait of a father.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|An adult male [[Barbary macaque]] carrying his offspring, a behaviour rarely found in other primates.]]\n[[File:Barbary lion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Barbary lion]]]]\nMorocco has a wide range of [[biodiversity]].

This has improved since, however, and in 2017, Morocco was upgraded to being a \"hybrid regime\" according to the Democracy Index in 2017 and the Freedom of the Press report in 2017 found that Morocco was \"partially free\".\n\nFollowing the March 1998 elections, a coalition government headed by opposition [[socialism|socialist]] leader [[Abderrahmane Youssoufi]] and composed largely of ministers drawn from opposition parties, was formed. Prime Minister Youssoufi's government was the first ever government drawn primarily from opposition parties, and also represents the first opportunity for a coalition of socialists, left-of-centre, and nationalist parties to be included in the government until October 2002. It was also the first time in the modern political history of the Arab world that the opposition assumed power following an election.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The current government is headed by [[Saadeddine Othmani]].\n\nThe [[Moroccan Constitution]] provides for a monarchy with a [[Parliament of Morocco|Parliament]] and an independent [[judiciary]].

He presides over the Council of Ministers; appoints the Prime Minister from the political party that has won the most seats in the parliamentary elections, and on recommendations from the latter, appoints the members of the government.\n\nThe previous constitution of 1996 theoretically allowed the king to terminate the tenure of any minister, and after consultation with the heads of the higher and lower Assemblies, to dissolve the Parliament, suspend the constitution, call for new elections, or rule by decree. The only time this happened was in 1965. The King is formally the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.\n\n===Legislative branch===\n[[File:Parliament of morocco.jpg|thumb|The legislature's building in Rabat.]]\nSince the constitutional reform of 1996, the bicameral legislature consists of two chambers. The [[Assembly of Representatives of Morocco]] (''Majlis an-Nuww\u00e2b/Assembl\u00e9e des R\u00e9presentants'') has 325 members elected for a five-year term, 295 elected in multi-seat [[constituency|constituencies]] and 30 in national lists consisting only of women. The [[Assembly of Councillors]] (''Majlis al-Mustasharin'') has 270 members, elected for a nine-year term, elected by local councils (162 seats), professional chambers (91 seats) and wage-earners (27 seats).\n\nThe Parliament's powers, though still relatively limited, were expanded under the 1992 and 1996 and even further in the 2011 constitutional revisions and include [[budget]]ary matters, approving [[bill (proposed law)|bill]]s, questioning ministers, and establishing ad hoc commissions of inquiry to investigate the government's actions. The lower chamber of Parliament may dissolve the government through a [[vote of no confidence]].\n\nThe latest parliamentary elections were held on [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2011|November 25, 2011]], and were considered by some neutral observers to be mostly free and fair.

Most Europeans visit in April and the autumn.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Morocco's relatively high number of tourists has been aided by its location, Morocco is close to Europe and attracts visitors to its beaches. Because of its proximity to Spain, tourists in southern Spain's coastal areas take one- to three-day trips to Morocco.\n\nAir services between Morocco and Algeria have been established, many Algerians have gone to Morocco to shop and visit family and friends. Morocco is relatively inexpensive because of the devaluation of the dirham and the increase of hotel prices in Spain. Morocco has an excellent road and rail infrastructure that links the major cities and tourist destinations with ports and cities with international airports. Low-cost airlines offer cheap flights to the country.\n\n[[File:Fes (5364214781).jpg|thumb|View of the medina (old city) of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]].]]\nTourism is increasingly focused on Morocco's culture, such as its ancient cities.

They range from private companies in the largest city, [[Casablanca]], the capital, [[Rabat]],\nand two other cities,{{Clarify|date=June 2017}} to public municipal utilities in 13 other cities, as well as a national electricity and water company (ONEE). The latter is in charge of bulk water supply to the aforementioned utilities, water distribution in about 500 small towns, as well as sewerage and wastewater treatment in 60 of these towns.\n\nThere have been substantial improvements in access to water supply, and to a lesser extent to sanitation, over the past fifteen years. Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater is being treated), lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighbourhoods, and limited sustainability of rural systems (20 percent of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005 a National Sanitation Program was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020. The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban poor is being addressed as part of the [[National Human Development Initiative]], under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network.\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{Main|Science and technology in Morocco}}\nThe [[Moroccan government]] has been implementing reforms to improve the quality of education and make research more responsive to socio-economic needs. In May 2009, Morocco's prime minister, Abbas El Fassi, announced greater support for science during a meeting at the National Centre for Scientific and Technical Research. The aim was to give universities greater financial autonomy from the government to make them more responsive to research needs and better able to forge links with the private sector, in the hope that this would nurture a culture of entrepreneurship in academia. He announced that investment in science and technology would rise from US$620,000 in 2008 to US$8.5 million (69 million Moroccan dirhams) in 2009, in order to finance the refurbishment and construction of laboratories, training courses for researchers in financial management, a scholarship programme for postgraduate research and incentive measures for companies prepared to finance research, such as giving them access to scientific results that they could then use to develop new products.<ref name=\"scidev.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scidev.net/en/middle-east-and-north-africa/news/morocco-to-boost-investment-in-science.html|title=Morocco to boost investment in science|last=SciDev.Net|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Moroccan Innovation Strategy'' was launched at the country's first National Innovation Summit in June 2009 by the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, Investment and the Digital Economy.

Through [[History of Morocco|Moroccan history]], it has hosted many people coming from East ([[Phoenicians]], [[Jews]] and [[Arabs]]), South ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]]ns) and North ([[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]]).

Among the buildings, and old Kasbah walls, sit French style-towns left behind by colonisation and intersect with intricately detailed mosques and riad-style homes. Sleek, modern designs are being constructed in cities like Rabat and Casablanca that give no particular homage to any of the past Moroccan architecture styles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heymorocco.com/morocco-architecture.aspx|title=Morocco Architecture}}</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n{{main|Moroccan literature}}\n[[File:Sebastiano del Piombo Portrait of a Humanist.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leo Africanus]].]]\nMoroccan literature is written in Arabic, Berber and French. Under the [[Almohad]] dynasty Morocco experienced a period of prosperity and brilliance of learning. The Almohad built the [[Koutoubia Mosque]] in Marrakesh, which accommodated no fewer than 25,000 people, but was also famed for its books, manuscripts, libraries and book shops, which gave it its name; the first book bazaar in history. The Almohad Caliph [[Yusuf I, Almohad Caliph|Abu Yakub]] had a great love for collecting books. He founded a great library, which was eventually carried to the [[Casbah]] and turned into a [[public library]].\n\nModern Moroccan literature began in the 1930s. Two main factors gave Morocco a pulse toward witnessing the birth of a modern literature. Morocco, as a [[French Morocco|French]] and [[Spanish Morocco|Spanish protectorate]] left Moroccan intellectuals the opportunity to exchange and to produce literary works freely enjoying the contact of other [[Arabic literature]] and Europe.\nThree generations of writers especially shaped 20th century Moroccan literature.<ref>Mohammed Benjelloun Touimi, Abdelkbir Khatibi and Mohamed Kably, ''Ecrivains marocains, du protectorat \u00e0 1965'', 1974  \u00e9ditions Sindbad, Paris and Hassan El Ouazzani, ''La litt\u00e9rature marocaine contemporaine de 1929 \u00e0 1999'' (2002, ed. Union des \u00e9crivains du Maroc and Dar Attaqafa)</ref> The first was the generation that lived and wrote during the [[French protectorate of Morocco|Protectorate]] (1912\u201356), its most important representative being [[Mohammed Ben Brahim]] (1897\u20131955).\n\nThe second generation was the one that played an important role in the transition to independence with writers like [[Abdelkrim Ghallab]] (1919\u20132006), [[Allal al-Fassi]] (1910\u20131974) and [[Mohammed al-Mokhtar Soussi]] (1900\u20131963). The third generation is that of writers of the sixties. Moroccan literature then flourished with writers such as [[Mohamed Choukri]], [[Driss Chra\u00efbi]], [[Mohamed Zafzaf]] and [[Driss El Khouri]]. Those writers were an important influence the many Moroccan novelists, poets and playwrights that were still to come.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Morocco was a refuge and artistic centre and attracted writers as [[Paul Bowles]], [[Tennessee Williams]] and [[William S. Burroughs]]. Moroccan literature flourished with novelists such as [[Mohamed Zafzaf]] and [[Mohamed Choukri]], who wrote in Arabic, and [[Driss Chra\u00efbi]] and [[Tahar Ben Jelloun]] who wrote in French. Other important Moroccan authors include, [[Abdellatif Laabi]], [[Abdelkrim Ghallab]], [[Fouad Laroui]], [[Mohammed Berrada]] and [[Leila Abouzeid]]. Orature (oral literature) is an integral part of Moroccan culture, be it in Moroccan Arabic or Berber.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|Music of Morocco}}\nMoroccan music is of Arabic, Berber and sub-Saharan origins. Rock-influenced [[chaabi (Morocco)|chaabi]] bands are widespread, as is [[trance music]] with historical origins in [[Islamic music]].\n\nMorocco is home to [[Andalusian classical music]] that is found throughout Northwest Africa. It probably evolved under the Moors in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]], and the Persian-born musician [[Ziryab]] is usually credited with its invention. A genre known as Contemporary Andalusian Music and art is the brainchild of [[Morisco]] visual artist/composer/[[oud]]ist [[Al-Andalus Ensemble|Tarik Banzi]], founder of the [http://www.Andalus.com/ Al-Andalus Ensemble].\n\n[[File:Musicians Jilala music in Morocco, 1900.png|thumb|A group of [[Jilala]] musicians in 1900]]\n''[[Aita]]'' is a [[Bedouin]] musical style sung in the countryside.\n\n[[Chaabi]] (\"popular\") is a music consisting of numerous varieties which are descended from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting.\n\nPopular Western forms of music are becoming increasingly popular in Morocco, such as [[Fusion (music)|fusion]], rock, [[Country music|country]], [[Metal (music)|metal]] and, in particular, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].\n\nMorocco participated in the [[1980 Eurovision Song Contest]], where it finished in the penultimate position.\n\n===Media===\n{{main|Media of Morocco|Cinema of Morocco}}\nCinema in Morocco has a long history, stretching back over a century to the filming of ''Le chevrier Marocain'' (\"The Moroccan Goatherd\") by [[Louis Lumi\u00e8re]] in 1897. Between that time and 1944, many foreign movies were shot in the country, especially in the [[Ouarzazate]] area.\n\nIn 1944, the Moroccan Cinematographic Center (CCM), the nation's film [[regulatory agency]], was established. Studios were also opened in [[Rabat]].\n\nIn 1952, [[Orson Welles]]' [[Othello (1952 film)|''Othello'']] won the [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] under the Moroccan flag. However, the Festival's musicians did not play the [[Hymne Ch\u00e9rifien|Moroccan national anthem]], as no one in attendance knew what it was.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wellesnet.com/filming_othello.htm|title=Wellesnet: Filming Othello}}</ref>\n\nSix years later, Mohammed Ousfour would create the first Moroccan movie, ''Le fils maudit'' (\"The Damned Son\").\n\nIn 1968, the first Mediterranean Film Festival was held in [[Tangier]]. In its current incarnation, the event is held in [[Tetouan]].\n\nThis was followed in 1982 with the first national festival of cinema, which was held in Rabat.\n\nIn 2001, the first [[International Film Festival of Marrakech]] (FIFM) was also held in [[Marrakech]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Moroccan cuisine}}\n[[File:Couscous of Fes.JPG|thumb|Moroccan [[Couscous]].]]\nMoroccan cuisine is considered as one of the most diversified cuisines in the world. This is a result of the centuries-long interaction of Morocco with the outside world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine|date=10 October 2007}}</ref> The cuisine of Morocco is mainly a fusion of Moorish, European and Mediterranean cuisines.\n\nSpices are used extensively in Moroccan cuisine. While spices have been imported to Morocco for thousands of years, many ingredients such as [[saffron]] from [[T\u00e9touan|Tiliouine]], [[Mentha|mint]] and [[olive]]s from [[Meknes]], and oranges and lemons from Fez, are home-grown. Chicken is the most widely eaten meat in Morocco. The most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco is beef; [[Sheep|lamb]] is preferred but is relatively expensive. The main Moroccan dish most people are familiar with is [[couscous]],<ref>[http://maroccankitchenrecipes.blogspot.com/2014/05/moroccan-couscous.html \"Moroccan Couscous Recipe\"].

Retrieved 1 April 2014.</ref> the old national delicacy.\n\nBeef is the most commonly eaten red meat in Morocco, usually eaten in a ''Tagine'' with vegetables or legumes. Chicken is also very commonly used in Tagines, knowing that one of the most famous tagine is the Tagine of Chicken, potatoes and olives. [[domestic sheep|Lamb]] is also consumed, but as Northwest African sheep breeds store most of their fat in their tails, Moroccan lamb does not have the pungent flavour that Western [[lamb and mutton]] have. Poultry is also very common, and the use of seafood is increasing in Moroccan food. In addition, there are dried salted meats and salted preserved meats such as kliia/khlia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/glossary/g/khlea_khlii.htm|title=klii|author=Benlafquih, Christine |publisher=About.com}}</ref> and \"g'did\" which are used to flavor tagines or used in \"el ghraif\" a folded savory Moroccan pancake.\n\nAmong the most famous Moroccan dishes are [[Couscous]], [[Pastilla]] (also spelled Bsteeya or Bestilla), [[Tajine]], [[Tangia|Tanjia]] and [[Harira]].

The second reform created a fund to cover services for the poor. Both reforms improved access to high-quality care. Infant mortality has improved significantly since 1960 when there were 144 deaths per 1000 live births, in 2000, 42 per 1,000 live births, and now it is 20 per 1,000 live births.<ref name=\":5\" /> The country's under-five mortality rate dropped by 60% between 1990 and 2011.

More effort is needed to increase access to health insurance, basic sanitation services and continue to lower infant and maternal mortality rates in the country.

It forms part of the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]], along with the [[Azores]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. In ancient times these islands were referred to as \"the Islands of the Blessed\" or the \"Fortunate Isles\". Located {{convert|570|km|mi}} west of the [[Cape Verde Peninsula]] off the coast of [[Northwest Africa]], the islands cover a combined area of slightly over {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nThe Cape Verde archipelago was uninhabited until the 15th century, when [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorers discovered and [[Colony|colonized]] the islands, establishing the first European settlement in the tropics. Ideally located for the [[Atlantic slave trade]], the islands grew prosperous throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, attracting merchants, [[privateer]]s, and [[Piracy|pirates]]. The end of slavery in the 19th century led to economic decline and emigration. Cape Verde gradually recovered as an important commercial center and stopover for shipping routes. Incorporated as an overseas department of Portugal in 1951, the islands continued to campaign for independence, which was peacefully achieved in 1975.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Cape Verde has been a stable [[representative democracy]], and remains one of the most developed and democratic countries in Africa. Lacking natural resources, its developing economy is mostly service-oriented, with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment. Its population of around 540,000 is mostly of mixed European, [[Moorish]], [[Arab]] and African heritage, and predominantly Roman Catholic, reflecting the legacy of Portuguese rule. A [[Cape Verdean diaspora|sizeable diaspora community]] exists across the world, slightly outnumbering inhabitants on the islands.\n\nHistorically, the name \"Cape Verde\" has been used in English for the archipelago and, since independence in 1975, for the country. In 2013, the Cape Verdean government determined that the Portuguese designation ''Cabo Verde'' would henceforth be used for official purposes, such as at the [[United Nations]], even in English contexts. <!--The name used in this article should not be changed unless and until there is a consensus to do so, based on changes in general English-language usage. The issue can be discussed on the talkpage, although unnecessary repetition should be avoided. --> Cape Verde is a member of the [[African Union]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe name of the country stems from the nearby [[Cap-Vert]], on the [[Senegal]]ese coast.<ref>Lobban, [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8KA40g7vnQC&pg=PA4 p. 4].</ref> In 1444, Portuguese explorers had named that landmark as ''Cabo Verde,'' a few years before they discovered the islands (''Verde'' is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"green\").\n\nOn 24 October 2013, the country's delegation announced at the United Nations that the official name should no longer be translated into other languages. Instead of \"Cape Verde\", the designation \"Republic of Cabo Verde\" is to be used.<ref name=\"NameNatGeo\"/><ref>{{cite web |title = Cabo Verde p\u00f5e fim \u00e0 tradu\u00e7\u00e3o da sua designa\u00e7\u00e3o oficial |url = http://www.panapress.com/Cabo-Verde-poe-fim-a-traducao-da-sua-designacao-oficial--3-885656-47-lang4-index.html |date = 31 October 2013 |accessdate = 17 December 2013 |publisher = Panapress |language = Portuguese |trans-title = Cabo Verde puts an end to translation of its official designation |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224228/http://www.panapress.com/Cabo-Verde-poe-fim-a-traducao-da-sua-designacao-oficial--3-885656-47-lang4-index.html# |archive-date = 17 December 2013 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Cape Verde}}\n[[File:Insulae Capitis viridis-1598.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|''Insulae Capitis Viridis'' (1598), showing Cape Verde]]\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, the Cape Verde Islands were uninhabited.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hist\u00f3ria|url=http://www.governo.cv/|website=governo|accessdate=28 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105202959/http://www.governo.cv/#|archive-date=5 November 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The islands of the Cape Verde archipelago were discovered by [[Genoa|Genoese]] and Portuguese [[navigator]]s around 1456.

Other navigators mentioned as contributing to discoveries in the Cape Verde archipelago are [[Diogo Gomes]] (who was with Ant\u00f3nio de Noli and claimed to have been the first to land on and name Santiago island), [[Diogo Dias]], Diogo Afonso and the Italian (Venice-born) [[Alvise Cadamosto]].\n\nIn 1462, Portuguese settlers arrived at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and founded a settlement they called Ribeira Grande (now called [[Cidade Velha]] (\"Old City\"), to avoid being confused with the town of [[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]] on the [[Santo Ant\u00e3o, Cape Verde|Santo Ant\u00e3o]] island).

Cape Verde's early prosperity slowly vanished. However, the islands' position astride mid-Atlantic shipping lanes made Cape Verde an ideal location for re-supplying ships. Because of its excellent harbour, the city of [[Mindelo]], located on the island of [[S\u00e3o Vicente, Cape Verde|S\u00e3o Vicente]], became an important commercial centre during the 19th century.<ref name=bn/> Diplomat [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited Cape Verde in 1832.<ref name=Roberts>{{cite book |last = Roberts |first = Edmund |title = Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat |year = 1837 |publisher = Harper & Brothers |location = New York |page = 17 |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/17/ |access-date = 10 October 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131109011955/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/17/# |archive-date = 9 November 2013 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n[[File:Garthpool SLV AllanGreen.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Grain ship ''Garthpool'', wrecked at Boavista, Cape Verde, in 1928]]\nWith few natural resources and inadequate sustainable investment from the Portuguese, the citizens grew increasingly discontented with the colonial masters, who nevertheless refused to provide the local authorities with more autonomy. In 1951, Portugal changed Cape Verde's status from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt growing [[nationalism]]. In 1956, [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]] and a group of fellow Cape Verdeans and Guineans organised (in [[Portuguese Guinea]]) the clandestine [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC).<ref name=bn/>\n\nIt demanded improvement in economic, social and political conditions in Cape Verde and Portuguese Guinea and formed the basis of the two nations' independence movement. Moving its headquarters to [[Conakry]], Guinea in 1960, the PAIGC began an armed rebellion against Portugal in 1961. Acts of sabotage eventually grew into a [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|war in Portuguese Guinea]] that pitted 10,000 [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet Bloc]]-supported PAIGC soldiers against 35,000 Portuguese and African troops.<ref name=bn/>\n\nBy 1972, the PAIGC controlled much of Portuguese Guinea despite the presence of the Portuguese troops, but the organization did not attempt to disrupt Portuguese control in Cape Verde. Portuguese Guinea declared independence in 1973 and was granted [[de jure]] independence in 1974. A budding independence movement&nbsp;\u2014 originally led by [[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]], assassinated in 1973&nbsp;\u2014 passed on to his half-brother [[Lu\u00eds Cabral]] and culminated in independence for the archipelago in 1975.\n\n=== Independence (1975) ===\n[[File:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1978, MiNr 2293.jpg|thumb|left|[[Am\u00edlcar Cabral]] on a stamp of the former [[East Germany]]]]\nFollowing the [[Carnation Revolution|April 1974 revolution in Portugal]], the PAIGC became an active political movement in Cape Verde. In December 1974, the PAIGC and Portugal signed an agreement providing for a transitional government composed of Portuguese and Cape Verdeans. On 30 June 1975, Cape Verdeans elected a National Assembly which received the instruments of independence from Portugal on 5 July 1975.<ref name=bn/> In the late 1970s and 1980s, most African countries prohibited [[South African Airways]] from overflights but Cape Verde allowed them and became a centre of activity for the airline's flights to Europe and the United States.\n\nImmediately following the [[History of Guinea-Bissau#Independence from Portugal|November 1980 coup in Guinea-Bissau]], relations between Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau became strained. Cape Verde abandoned its hope for unity with Guinea-Bissau and formed the [[African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde]] (PAICV). Problems have since been resolved and [[Cape Verde\u2013Guinea-Bissau relations|relations between the countries]] are good. The PAICV and its predecessor established a one-party system and ruled Cape Verde from independence until 1990.<ref name=bn/>\n\nResponding to growing pressure for pluralistic democracy, the PAICV called an emergency congress in February 1990 to discuss proposed constitutional changes to end one-party rule. Opposition groups came together to form the [[Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)|Movement for Democracy]] (MPD) in Praia in April 1990. Together, they campaigned for the right to contest the presidential election scheduled for December 1990.\n\nThe one-party state was abolished 28 September 1990, and the first multi-party elections were held in January 1991. The MPD won a majority of the seats in the National Assembly, and MPD presidential candidate [[Ant\u00f3nio Mascarenhas Monteiro]] defeated the PAICV's candidate with 73.5% of the votes. Legislative elections in December 1995 increased the MPD majority in the National Assembly. The party won 50 of the National Assembly's 72 seats.\n\nA February 1996 presidential election returned President Monteiro to office. Legislative elections in January 2001 returned power to the PAICV, with the PAICV holding 40 of the National Assembly seats, MPD 30, and [[Party for Democratic Convergence]] (PCD) and [[Labour and Solidarity Party]] (PTS) 1 each. In February 2001, the PAICV-supported presidential candidate [[Pedro Pires]] defeated former MPD leader [[Carlos Veiga]] by only 13 votes.<ref name=bn/>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Politics ==\n{{Main|Politics of Cape Verde}}\n[[File:Jorge Carlos Fonseca with Obamas 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Cape Verdean President [[Jorge Carlos Fonseca]] and [[Ligia Fonseca]] meet with the US President [[Barack Obama]] and [[Michelle Obama]] in 2014.]]\n[[File:CV-praia-just-pal.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Pal\u00e1cio da Justi\u00e7a'' - Palace of Justice, in Praia]]\n\nCape Verde is a stable [[Semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] [[Representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]].<ref name=\"SpL\"/><ref name=constitution>{{cite web |url = http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/CapeVerde.pdf |title = Constitution of Cape Verde |year = 1992 |accessdate = 20 March 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713081027/http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/CapeVerde.pdf# |archive-date = 13 July 2011 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is among the most democratic nations in Africa, ranking 26th in the world, according to the ''2018 [[Democracy Index]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eiu.com/Handlers/WhitepaperHandler.ashx?fi=Democracy_Index_2018.pdf&mode=wp&campaignid=Democracy2018|title=Democracy Index 2018: Me Too?|last=The Economist Intelligence Unit|first=|date=8 January 2019|website=The Economist Intelligence Unit|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref> The [https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Cape_Verde_1992?lang=en constitution]&nbsp;\u2014 adopted in 1980 and revised in 1992, 1995 and 1999&nbsp;\u2014 defines the basic principles of its government.

Praia, on the southeast coast, is the largest city of the island and the largest city and capital of the country.\n\nBecause of their proximity to the Sahara, most of the Cape Verde islands are dry, but on islands with high mountains and farther away from the coast, by orography, the humidity is much higher, providing a rainforest habitat, although much affected by the human presence. Northeastern slopes of high mountains often receive a lot of rain while southwest slopes do not. These umbria areas are identified with cool and moisture.\n\nWestern Hemisphere-bound hurricanes often have their early beginnings near the Cape Verde Islands. These are referred to as [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]]s. These hurricanes can become very intense as they cross warm Atlantic waters away from Cape Verde. The average hurricane season has about two Cape Verde-type hurricanes, which are usually the largest and most intense storms of the season because they often have plenty of warm open ocean over which to develop before encountering land. The five largest Atlantic tropical cyclones on record have been Cape Verde-type hurricanes. Most of the longest-lived tropical cyclones in the Atlantic basin are Cape Verde hurricanes.\n\nThe islands themselves have only been struck by hurricanes twice in recorded history (since 1851): once in 1892, and again in 2015 by [[Hurricane Fred (2015)|Hurricane Fred]], the easternmost hurricane ever to form in the Atlantic.\n\n===Biome===\n{{main|Wildlife of Cape Verde}}\nCape Verde's isolation has resulted in the islands having a number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[species]], particularly birds and reptiles, many of which are [[endangered species|endangered]] by human development.

other countries and international organizations often providing [[development aid]]. Since 2007, the UN has classified it as a [[developing nation]] rather than a [[least developed country]].\n\nCape Verde has few [[natural resource]]s. Only five of the ten main islands (Santiago, Santo Ant\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Nicolau, Fogo, and Brava) normally support significant agricultural production,<ref>See Carlos Ferreira Couto, ''Incerteza, adaptabilidade e inova\u00e7\u00e3o na sociedade rural da Ilha de Santiago de Cabo Verde'', Lisbon: Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Galouste Gulbenkian, 2010</ref> and over 90% of all food consumed in Cape Verde is imported.

A number of wine tours of Cape Verde's various microclimates began to be offered in spring 2010 and can be arranged through the tourism office.\n\nThe economy of Cape Verde is service-oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for more than 70% of GDP.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Although nearly 35% of the population lives in rural areas, agriculture and fishing contribute only about 9% of GDP. Light manufacturing accounts for most of the remainder. Fish and shellfish are plentiful, and small quantities are exported. Cape Verde has cold storage and freezing facilities and [[fish processing]] plants in Mindelo, Praia, and on Sal. Expatriate Cape Verdeans contribute an amount estimated at about 20% of GDP to the domestic economy through [[remittance]]s.<ref name=bn/>\nIn spite of having few natural resources and being semi-desert, the country boasts the highest living standards in the region, and has attracted thousands of immigrants of different nationalities.\n\nSince 1991, the government has pursued market-oriented economic policies, including an open welcome to [[foreign investors]] and a far-reaching [[privatization]] programme. It established as top development priorities the promotion of a [[market economy]] and of the private sector; the development of [[Tourism in Cape Verde|tourism]], light manufacturing industries, and fisheries; and the development of [[Transport in Cape Verde|transport]], [[Communications in Cape Verde|communications]], and energy facilities. From 1994 to 2000 about $407 million in foreign investments were made or planned, of which 58% were in tourism,<ref>See now Br\u00edgida Rocha Brito and others, ''Turismo em Meio Insular Africano: Potencialidades, constrangimentos e impactos'', Lisbon: Gerpress, 2010</ref> 17% in industry, 4% in infrastructure, and 21% in fisheries and services.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn 2011, on four islands a wind farm was built that supplies about 30% of the electricity of the country.

Strong economic performance was bolstered by one of the fastest growing tourism industries in the world, as well as by substantial capital inflows that allowed Cape Verde to build up national currency reserves to the current 3.5 months of imports. Unemployment has been falling rapidly, and the country is on track to achieve most of the UN Millennium Development Goals \u2013 including halving its 1990 poverty level.\n\nIn 2007, Cape Verde joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and in 2008 the country graduated from [[Least developed country|Least Developed Country]] (LDC) to Middle Income Country (MIC) status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/cape-verde/cape-verde-financial-sector-profile.html|title=MFW4A|website=MFW4A|date=|accessdate=31 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513110352/http://www.mfw4a.org/cape-verde/cape-verde-financial-sector-profile.html#|archive-date=13 May 2011|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://data.worldbank.org/country/cape-verde |title = Cabo Verde - Data |publisher = [[World Bank]] |access-date = 22 August 2011 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110811164323/http://data.worldbank.org/country/cape-verde# |archive-date = 11 August 2011 |dead-url = no |df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nCape Verde has significant cooperation with Portugal at every level of the economy, which has led it to link its currency first to the [[Portuguese escudo]] and, in 1999, to the [[euro]].

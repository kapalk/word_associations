In 1543, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] a Polish astronomer from [[Toru\u0144]], published his epochal work ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''), and thereby became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming the [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]], which became the accepted basic model for the practice of modern astronomy.

The [[Warsaw Confederation]] (1573) guaranteed religious freedom for the Polish nobility ''(Szlachta)'' and townsmen ''(Mieszczanie)''. However, the [[peasant]]s ''(Ch\u0142opi)'' were still subject to severe limitations imposed on them by the nobility.<ref name=\"Dembkowski/Lublin\" /> The establishment of the Commonwealth coincided with a period of stability and prosperity in Poland, with the union thereafter becoming a European power and a major cultural entity, occupying approximately one million square kilometers of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as an agent for the dissemination of [[Western culture]] through [[Polonization]] into areas of modern-day Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus and Western Russia.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries, [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa]] kings [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] and [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV]] and found itself engaged in major conflicts with [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], Sweden and the Ottoman Empire, as well as a series of minor [[Cossacks|Cossack]] uprisings.<ref name=\"gierowski\" /> In 1610, a Polish army under command [[Hetman]] [[Stanis\u0142aw \u017b\u00f3\u0142kiewski]] seized Moscow after winning the [[Battle of Klushino]].

Starting in 1648, the [[Cossack]] [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] engulfed the south and east, eventually leaving Ukraine divided, with the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia. This was followed by the [[Deluge (history)|'Deluge']], a Swedish invasion of Poland, which marched through the Polish heartlands and ruined the country's population, culture and infrastructure\u2014around four million of Poland's eleven million inhabitants died in famines and epidemics throughout the 17th century.<ref name=\"britannica1\" /> However, under [[John III Sobieski]] the Commonwealth's military prowess was re-established, and in 1683 Polish forces played a major role in the [[Battle of Vienna]] against the [[Ottoman Army (15th-19th centuries)|Ottoman Army]], commanded by [[Kara Mustafa Pasha|Kara Mustafa]], the Grand Vizier of the [[Ottoman Empire]].\n\n[[File:Jan III Schultz.jpg|thumb|left|upright|King [[John III Sobieski]] defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Vienna]] on 12 September 1683.]]\n\nSobieski's reign marked the end of the nation's golden era. Finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy, the Commonwealth fell into decline. The government became ineffective as a result of large-scale internal conflicts (e.g. [[Lubomirski Rebellion]] against [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] and rebellious [[confederation (Poland)|confederations]]) and corrupted legislative processes. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of ''[[magnat (Poland)|magnats]]'', and this, compounded with two relatively weak kings of the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] [[House of Wettin|Wettin dynasty]], [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], as well as the rise of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]] only served to worsen the Commonwealth's plight.

The most populous capital city of Warsaw replaced [[Gda\u0144sk]] (Danzig) as the leading centre of commerce, and the role of the more prosperous townsmen increased.\n\n=== Partitions ===\n{{Main|History of Poland (1795\u20131918)|Partitions of Poland|}}\n[[File:Stanis\u0142aw II August Poniatowski in coronation clothes.PNG|thumb|upright|[[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]], the last [[King of Poland]], ascended to the throne in 1764 and reigned until his abdication on 25 November 1795.]]\nThe [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski|Stanis\u0142aw II August]] (a Polish aristocrat connected to the [[Czartoryski family]] faction of [[magnates]]) to the monarchy. However, as a one-time personal admirer of Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation, and his perceived necessity to remain in a political relationship with his Russian sponsor. This led to the formation of the 1768 [[Bar Confederation]], a ''szlachta'' rebellion directed against the Polish king and his Russian sponsors, which aimed to preserve Poland's independence and the szlachta's traditional privileges.\nAttempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours, and in 1772 the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Commonwealth]] by Prussia, Russia and Austria took place; an act which the \"[[Partition Sejm]]\", under considerable duress, eventually \"ratified\" ''fait accompli''.<ref name=\"wydawnictwo\" /> Disregarding this loss, in 1773 the king established the [[Commission of National Education]], the first government education authority in Europe.

However, this document, accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies, generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth's nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II, who, determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Russia was aided in achieving its goal when the [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help. In May 1792, Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's frontier, thus beginning the [[Polish\u2013Russian War of 1792|Polish-Russian War]].\n\nThe defensive war fought by the Poles ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation then took over the government. Russia and Prussia, fearing the mere existence of a Polish state, arranged for, and in 1793 executed, the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Commonwealth]], which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence.

However, over time the Russian monarch reduced Polish freedoms, and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name. Meanwhile, the Prussian controlled territory of Poland came under increased Germanization. Thus, in the 19th century, only Austrian-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and particularly the [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w]], allowed free Polish culture to flourish.\n\nThroughout the period of the partitions, political and cultural repression of the Polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying Russian, Prussian and Austrian governments. In 1830, the [[November Uprising]] began in Warsaw when, led by Lieutenant [[Piotr Wysocki]], young [[non-commissioned officer]]s at the [[Corps of Cadets (Warsaw)|Officer Cadet School]] in Warsaw revolted. They were joined by large segments of Polish society, and together forced Warsaw's Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city.\n\n[[File:MWP 1830 Arsenal.jpg|thumb|Capture of the [[Warsaw Arsenal]] by the Polish army during the [[November Uprising]] against [[Tsarist autocracy]], 29 November 1830.]]\n\nOver the course of the next seven months, Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch]] and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with Prussia and Austria refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure. Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General [[Ivan Paskievich]], many Polish troops, feeling they could not go on, withdrew into Prussia and there laid down their arms. After the defeat, the semi-independent Congress Poland lost its constitution, army and legislative assembly, and was integrated more closely with the Russian Empire.\n\nDuring the [[Spring of Nations]] (a series of revolutions which swept across Europe), Poles took up arms in the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1848)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1848]] to resist Prussian rule. Initially, the uprising manifested itself in the form of civil disobedience, but eventually turned into an armed struggle when the Prussian military was sent in to pacify the region. Eventually, after several battles the uprising was suppressed by the Prussians, and the [[Grand Duchy of Posen]] was more completely incorporated into Prussia.\n\nIn 1863, a new Polish uprising against Russian rule began. The [[January Uprising]] started out as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against [[conscription]] into the Imperial Russian Army. However, the insurrectionists, despite being joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians, were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support. They were forced to resort to guerrilla warfare tactics and failed to win any major military victories. Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russian-controlled Congress Poland, and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement.\n\nDespite the political unrest experienced during the partitions, Poland did benefit from large-scale industrialisation and modernisation programs, instituted by the occupying powers, which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity. This was particularly true in Greater Poland, Silesia and Eastern Pomerania controlled by Prussia (later becoming a part of the [[German Empire]]); areas which eventually, thanks largely to the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918\u20131919)|Greater Poland Uprising of 1918]] and [[Silesian Uprisings]], were reconstituted as a part of the [[Second Polish Republic]], becoming the country's most prosperous regions.\n\n=== Reconstruction ===\n{{Main|History of Poland (1918\u201339)|Kingdom of Poland (1916\u201318)||Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Second Polish Republic}}\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Naczelnik pa\u0144stwa|Chief of State]] Marshal [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]] was a hero of the Polish independence campaign and the nation's premiere statesman between 1918 until his death on 12 May 1935.]]\n\nDuring [[World War I]], all the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] agreed on the reconstitution of Poland that United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]] proclaimed in Point 13 of his [[Fourteen Points]]. A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and 450,000 died. Shortly after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|armistice with Germany in November 1918]], Poland regained its independence as the [[Second Polish Republic]] (''II Rzeczpospolita Polska''). It reaffirmed its independence after [[List of wars involving Poland|a series of military conflicts]], the most notable being the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] (1919\u201321) when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Red Army]] at the [[battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], an event which is considered to have halted the advance of Communism into Europe and forced [[Vladimir Lenin]] to rethink his objective of achieving global socialism.

Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards [[Warsaw]] instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a [[Gdynia|major seaport]] was opened on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged [[Free City of Danzig]].\n\nThe inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the First World War, the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Ignacy Paderewski]] (who would later become prime minister) returned home to help; a significant number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures.

This action angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place. However, upon achieving victory in 1945, the elections organized by the occupying Soviet authorities were falsified and were used to provide a veneer of legitimacy for Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Anti-Communism in the Communist Bloc|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]], the Soviet occupation of Poland met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the Fifties.\n\nDespite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland<ref name=\"indianapolis\" /> (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lw\u00f3w]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture. In the European scene, it came to characterize the full-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.\n\nThe [[People's Republic of Poland]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]].

[[Collectivization in the Polish People's Republic]] failed. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted.

In the north-west is the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] seacoast, which extends from the [[Bay of Pomerania]] to the [[Gda\u0144sk Bay|Gulf of Gda\u0144sk]]. This coast is marked by several [[spit (landform)|spits]], coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and dunes. The largely straight coastline is indented by the [[Szczecin Lagoon]], the [[Bay of Puck]], and the [[Vistula Lagoon]].\n\nThe centre and parts of the north of the country lie within the [[North European Plain]]. Rising above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising four hilly districts of [[moraine]]s and [[moraine-dammed lake]]s formed during and after the [[Quaternary glaciation|Pleistocene ice age]]. These lake districts are the [[Pomerania]]n Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the [[Kashubia]]n Lake District, and the [[Masurian Lake District]]. The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern Poland. The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge, a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]].\n\nSouth of the Northern European Plain are the regions of [[Lusatia]], [[Silesia]] and [[Masovia]], which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys. Farther south is a mountainous region, including the [[Sudetes]], the [[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]]s, the [[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Mountains]], and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the [[Beskids]]. The highest part of the Carpathians is the [[Tatra Mountains]], along Poland's southern border.\n\n=== Geology ===\n[[File:Brama Krakowska, Dolina Pr\u0105dnika.jpg|thumb|left|[[Krak\u00f3w-Cz\u0119stochowa Upland]]s in the [[Lesser Poland]] region]]\n\nThe geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of Europe and Africa over the past 60&nbsp;million years and, more recently, by the [[Quaternary]] glaciations of northern Europe. Both processes shaped the [[Sudetes]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the ice age river valleys of the south often contain [[loess]]. The [[Polish Jura]], the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the [[Beskids]], and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] has some of the oldest rock formation on the continent of Europe.\n\n[[File:Morskie Oko o poranku.jpg|thumb|[[Tatra Mountains]] in southern Poland average 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) in elevation.]]\n\nPoland has 70 mountains over {{convert|2,000|m|ft|abbr=off}} in elevation, all in the [[Tatras]]. The Polish Tatras, which consist of the High Tatras and the Western Tatras, is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire Carpathian range. In the High Tatras lies Poland's highest point, the north-western summit of [[Rysy]], {{convert|2499|m|ft|0}} in elevation.

It covers an area of {{convert|32|km2|sqmi|0}}. It is not a natural desert but results from human activity from the [[Middle Ages]] onwards.\n\nThe Baltic Sea activity in [[S\u0142owi\u0144ski National Park]] created [[sand dunes]] which in the course of time separated the bay from the sea creating two lakes. As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move, at a rate of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|1}} per year. Some dunes reach the height of up to {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}.

Poland ranks in the top 20 percent of the most peaceful countries in the world, according to the [[Global Peace Index]]. The government structure centers on the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland|Council of Ministers]], led by a [[Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|prime minister]]. The president appoints the cabinet according to the proposals of the prime minister, typically from the majority coalition in the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]]. The president is elected by popular vote every five years. The current [[President of the Republic of Poland|president]] is [[Andrzej Duda]] and the [[Prime Minister of Poland|prime minister]] is [[Mateusz Morawiecki]].\n\nPolish voters elect a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament consisting of a 460-member lower house (Sejm) and a 100-member Senate ([[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senat]]). The Sejm is elected under [[proportional representation]] according to the [[d'Hondt method]], a method similar to that used in many parliamentary political systems. The Senat, on the other hand, is elected under the [[first-past-the-post voting]] method, with one senator being returned from each of the 100 constituencies.\n\n[[File:Zgromadzenie Narodowe 4 czerwca 2014 Kancelaria Senatu 01.JPG|thumb|[[Sejm]] is the [[lower house]] of the Polish [[parliament]].]]\n\nWith the exception of ethnic minority parties, only candidates of [[List of political parties in Poland|political parties]] receiving at least 5% of the total national vote can enter the Sejm. When sitting in joint session, members of the Sejm and Senat form the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] (the ''Zgromadzenie Narodowe''). The National Assembly is formed on three occasions: when a new president takes the [[oath of office]]; when an indictment against the President of the Republic is brought to the State Tribunal (''Trybuna\u0142 Stanu''); and when a president's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties due to the state of his health is declared. To date only the first instance has occurred.\n\nThe [[judiciary|judicial branch]] plays an important role in decision-making. Its major institutions include the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]] (''S\u0105d Najwy\u017cszy''); the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''Naczelny S\u0105d Administracyjny''); the [[Constitutional Tribunal of Poland|Constitutional Tribunal]] (''Trybuna\u0142 Konstytucyjny''); and the [[State Tribunal (Poland)|State Tribunal]] (''Trybuna\u0142 Stanu''). On the approval of the Senat, the Sejm also appoints the [[Polish Ombudsman|ombudsman]] or the Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection (''Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich'') for a five-year term. The ombudsman has the duty of guarding the observance and implementation of the rights and liberties of Polish citizens and residents, of the law and of principles of community life and social justice.\n\n=== Law ===\n{{Main|Law of Poland}}\n[[File:Polishsupremecourt.JPEG|left|upright|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]] building in [[Warsaw]]]]\n\nThe [[Constitution of Poland]] is the supreme law in contemporary Poland, and the Polish legal system is based on the principle of civil rights, governed by the code of Civil Law. Historically, the most famous Polish legal act is the [[Constitution of 3 May 1791]]. Historian [[Norman Davies]] describes it as the first of its kind in Europe.<ref name=\"Davies 699\" /> The Constitution was instituted as a [[Government Act]] ({{lang-pl|Ustawa rz\u0105dowa}}) and then adopted on 3 May 1791 by the [[Sejm]] of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Primarily, it was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the [[federation|federative]] Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth and its [[Golden Liberty]]. Previously only the [[Henrician Articles]] signed by each of Poland's elected kings could perform the function of a set of basic laws.\n\n[[File:Manuscript of the Constitution of the 3rd May 1791.PNG|thumb|upright|The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|''Constitution of 3 May'']] adopted in 1791 was the first modern constitution in Europe.<ref name=\"Davies 699\" />]]\n\nThe new Constitution introduced political equality between [[townspeople]] and the [[nobility]] (''[[szlachta]]''), and placed the [[peasant]]s under the protection of the government. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which at one time had placed the [[sejm]] at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be [[bribery|bribed]] by an interest or foreign power, to have rescinded all the legislation that had been passed by that sejm. The 3 May Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's [[reactionary]] [[magnate]]s, with a more [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and democratic [[constitutional monarchy]]. The adoption of [[:wikisource:Constitution of 3 May 1791|the constitution]] was treated as a threat by Poland's neighbours.<ref name=\"Gierowski 251\">{{cite book |author=J\u00f3zef Andrzej Gierowski |authorlink=J\u00f3zef Andrzej Gierowski |title=Historia Polski, 1505\u20131764 |language=Polish |trans-title=History of Poland, 1505\u20131764 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBNjywAACAAJ |accessdate=26 October 2014| year=1986| publisher=Pa\u0144stwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe |isbn=978-83-01-03732-1 |page=251}}</ref> In response [[Prussia]], Austria and Russia formed an anti-Polish alliance and over the next decade collaborated with one another to [[Partitions of Poland|partition]] their weaker neighbour and destroyed the Polish state.

Prior to the [[Third Partition of Poland|last Partition]] in 1795, tax-paying females were allowed to take part in political life. Since 1918, following the return to independence, all women could vote. Poland was the 15th (12th sovereign) country to introduce universal women's suffrage.

It guarantees a multi-party state, the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly, and specifically casts off many Communist ideals to create a '[[free market]] [[economic system]]'. It requires public officials to pursue ecologically sound public policy and acknowledges the inviolability of the home, the right to form trade unions, and to strike, whilst at the same time prohibiting the practices of forced medical experimentation, torture and corporal punishment.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Poland|List of diplomatic missions of Poland}}\nIn recent years, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and international affairs, supporting and establishing friendly relations with other European nations and a large number of 'developing' countries.\n\nPoland is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations|UN]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[European Economic Area]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[European Space Agency]], [[G6 (EU)|G6]], [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]], [[Visegr\u00e1d Group]], [[Weimar Triangle]] and [[Schengen Agreement]].\n\nIn 1994, Poland became an associate member of the European Union (EU) and its defensive arm, the [[Western European Union]] (WEU), having submitted preliminary documentation for full membership in 1996, it formally joined the European Union in May 2004, along with the other members of the [[Visegr\u00e1d group]]. In 1996, Poland achieved full [[OECD]] membership, and at the 1997 Madrid Summit was invited to join the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) in the first wave of [[Enlargement of NATO|policy enlargement]] finally becoming a full member of NATO in March 1999.\n\n[[File:Ministerstwo Spraw Zagraniczych al. Szucha 23.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Poland)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] located in [[Warsaw]]]]\n\nAs changes since the fall of Communism in 1989 have redrawn the map of Europe, Poland has tried to forge strong and mutually beneficial relationships with its seven new neighbours, this has notably included signing 'friendship treaties' to replace links severed by the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. Poland has forged a special relationships with [[Ukraine]],<ref name=\"grushenko\" /> with whom it co-hosted the UEFA [[Euro 2012]] football tournament, in an effort to firmly anchor the country within the Western world and provide it with an alternative to aligning itself with the [[Russian Federation]]. Despite many positive developments in the region, Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the [[former Soviet Union]]; this is particularly true of [[Belarus]], where in 2005 the [[Lukashenko]] regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority.<ref name=\"Bordering on madness: Belarus mistreats its Polish minority\" />\n\nPoland is the sixth most populous member state of the European Union and has a grand total of 51 representatives in the [[European Parliament]]. Ever since joining the union in 2004, successive Polish governments have pursued policies to increase the country's role in European and regional affairs.\n\n=== Administrative divisions ===\n{{Main|Administrative divisions of Poland}}\n\nPoland's current [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] (provinces) are largely based on the country's historic regions, whereas those of the past two decades (to 1998) had been centred on and named for individual cities. The new units range in area from less than {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}} for Opole Voivodeship to more than {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed [[voivode]] (governor), an elected regional assembly (''[[Voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]'') and a voivodeship marshal, an executive elected by that assembly.\n\nThe voivodeships are subdivided into ''[[powiat]]s'' (often referred to in English as counties), and these are further divided into ''[[gmina]]s'' (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both ''gmina'' and ''powiat''. Poland has 16 voivodeships, 380 powiats (including 66 cities with ''powiat'' status), and 2,478 ''gminas''.\n\n{| style=\"background:none;\"\n|-\n|\n{{Image label begin|image=Poland location map.svg|width={{{width|400}}}|float={{{float|left}}}|padding=15px}} <!--\n===== Polish Regions =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.37|y=0.161|scale={{{width|400}}}|text ={{flagicon|Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br>[[Pomeranian Voivodeship|Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.13|y=0.25|scale={{{width|400}}}| text= {{flagicon|West Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br>[[West Pomeranian Voivodeship|West<br> Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.61|y=0.22|scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship}}<br>[[Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship|Warmian-Masurian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.83|y=0.32|scale={{{width|400}}}| text={{flagicon|Podlaskie Voivodeship}}<br>[[Podlaskie Voivodeship|Podlaskie]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.668|y=0.43|scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|Masovian Voivodeship}}<br>[[Masovian Voivodeship|Masovian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.41|y=0.33|scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship}}<br>[[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Kuyavian-<br>Pomeranian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.28|y=0.47|scale={{{width|400}}}|text ={{flagicon|Greater Poland Voivodeship}}<br>[[Greater Poland Voivodeship|Greater Poland]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.15|y=0.48|scale={{{width|400}}}|text ={{flagicon|Lubusz Voivodeship}}<br>[[Lubusz Voivodeship|Lubusz]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.20|y=0.62|scale={{{width|400}}}|text ={{flagicon|Lower Silesian Voivodeship}}<br>[[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.55|y=0.562|scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship}}<br>[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship|\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.40|y=0.70|scale={{{width|400}}}|text ={{flagicon|Opole Voivodeship}}<br>[[Opole Voivodeship|Opole]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.86|y=0.60|scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|Lublin Voivodeship}}<br>[[Lublin Voivodeship|Lublin]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.62|y=0.82| scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|Lesser Poland Voivodeship}}<br>[[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser<br>Poland]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.75|y=0.80| scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|Podkarpackie Voivodeship}}<br>[[Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Subcarpathian]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.64|y=0.69| scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship}}<br>[[\u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship|Holy Cross]]}}\n{{Image label small|x=0.48|y=0.75| scale={{{width|400}}}|text={{flagicon|Silesian Voivodeship}}<br>[[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesian]]}}<!--\n\n===== Other countries =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.69| y=0.11|scale={{{width|400}}}| text=[[Kaliningrad Oblast|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Kaliningrad<br>(Russia)</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.915|y=0.100|scale={{{width|400}}}| text=[[Lithuania|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Lithuania</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.94|y=0.47|scale={{{width|400}}}| text=[[Belarus|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Belarus</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.93|y=0.88|scale={{{width|400}}}| text=[[Ukraine|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Ukraine</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.52| y=0.975|scale={{{width|400}}}| text=[[Slovakia|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Slovakia</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.12| y=0.86|scale={{{width|400}}}| text=[[Czech Republic|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Czech Republic</i>]] }}\n{{Image label small|x=0.05| y=0.57|scale={{{width|400}}}| text=[[Germany|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5;\">Germany</i>]] }}<!--\n===== Seas \u2013 Oceans \u2013 Etc =====\n-->{{Image label small|x=0.20|y=0.10|scale={{{width|400}}}| text=[[Baltic Sea|<i style=\"color:#48A3B5\">Baltic Sea</i>]] }}\n{{Image label end}}\n\n|\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"| [[Voivodeship]] !!rowspan=\"2\"| [[List of cities and towns in Poland|Capital city or cities]]\n|-\n!

Also, the Polish Navy played a more international role as part of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], providing logistical support for the [[United States Navy]]. The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same; it has routinely taken part in [[Baltic Air Policing]] assignments, but otherwise, with the exception of a number of units serving in [[Afghanistan]], has seen no active combat.

This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of [[wind farm]]s and a number of [[hydroelectric]] stations.\n\nPoland has around 164,800,000,000 m<sup>3</sup> of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are exploited by energy supply companies such as [[PKN Orlen]] (\"the only Polish company listed in the [[Fortune Global 500]]\"), [[PGNiG]]. However, the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland is insufficient to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population. Therefore, the country is a net importer of oil and natural gas.\n\nThe 5 largest companies supplying Poland electricity are [[Polska Grupa Energetyczna|PGE]], [[Tauron Group|Tauron]], [[Enea SA|Enea]], [[:pl:Energa|Energa]] and [[Innogy|Innogy Poland]].\n\n=== Transport ===\n{{Main|Transport in Poland|List of airports in Poland|Highways in Poland}}\n[[File:Wezelsosnicafromthesky.JPG|thumb|[[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1]], [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4]] motorways and [[National roads in Poland|express road 44]] junction near [[Gliwice]]]]\nTransport in Poland is provided by means of [[Rail transport in Poland|rail]], [[Roads and expressways in Poland|road]], [[Polish Merchant Navy|marine shipping]] and [[List of airports in Poland|air travel]].

In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]], also known as a Charter of Jewish Liberties, granted [[Jews]] living in the Polish lands unprecedented legal rights not found anywhere in Europe. In 1424, the Polish king was pressed by the Bishops to issue the [[Edict of Wielu\u0144]], outlawing early Protestant [[Hussite|Hussitism]]. Then in 1573, the [[Warsaw Confederation]] marked the formal beginning of extensive religious freedoms granted to all faiths in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The act was not imposed by a king or consequence of war, but rather resulted from the actions of members of the Polish-Lithuanian society. It was also influenced by the events of the 1572 French [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]], which prompted the Polish-Lithuanian nobility to see that no monarch would ever be able to carry out such reprehensible atrocities in Poland. The act is also credited with keeping the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth out of the [[Thirty Years' War]], fought between German Protestants and Catholics.<ref>Adam Zamojski, \"The Polish Way\".

They will attend this school for three years during classes 7, 8, and 9. Students then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend.

Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' and [[God Is Born]] (a coronation [[polonaise]] for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, [[Miko\u0142aj z Radomia|Nicholas of Radom]], was born and lived in the 15th century. During the 16th century, two main musical groups \u2013 both based in [[Krak\u00f3w]] and belonging to the King and Archbishop of [[Wawel]] \u2013 led to the rapid development of Polish renaissance music.

All of Chopin's [[List of compositions by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|works]] involve the piano and are technically demanding, emphasising nuance and expressive depth. As a great composer, Chopin invented the [[musical form]] known as the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ballade]] and made major innovations to the [[piano sonata]], [[mazurka]], [[waltz]], [[nocturne]], [[polonaise]], [[\u00e9tude]], [[impromptu]] and [[prelude (music)|pr\u00e9lude]], he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music. It is largely thanks to him that such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century. Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of [[Zakopane]].\n\nToday Poland has a very active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular among the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as [[Krzysztof Komeda]] created a unique style, which was most famous in the 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Since the fall of communism throughout Europe, Poland has become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the [[Open'er Festival]], [[Opole Festival]] and [[Sopot Festival]].\n\n=== Art ===\n{{Main|Art in Poland|Young Poland|List of Polish artists}}\n[[File:The Lady with an Ermine.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' (1490) by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

[[Romanesque architecture]] is represented by [[St. Andrew's Church, Krak\u00f3w]], and [[St. Mary's Church, Gda\u0144sk]], is characteristic for the [[Brick Gothic]] style found in Poland. Richly decorated [[attic style|attics]] and [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] [[loggia]]s are the common elements of the Polish Renaissance architecture,<ref name=\"szydlowiec\" /><ref name=\"RENAISSANCE CULTURAL BACKGROUND\" /> as evident in the [[Pozna\u0144 City Hall|City Hall]] in Pozna\u0144. For some time the late renaissance style known as [[mannerism]], most notably in the [[Cracow Bishops' Palace in Kielce|Bishop's Palace]] in [[Kielce]], coexisted with the early baroque style, typified in the [[Saints Peter and Paul Church, Krak\u00f3w|Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Krak\u00f3w]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | image1 = 20110917 Krakow Kosciol Mariacki 0306.jpg\n | width1 = 155\n | alt1 = Saint Mary's Church in Krak\u00f3w\n | caption1 = [[St. Mary's Basilica, Krak\u00f3w|St. Mary's Basilica]] on the [[Main Market Square, Krak\u00f3w|Main Market Square]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]] is an example of [[Brick Gothic]] architecture.\n | image2 = Ayuntamiento, Poznan, Polonia, 2014-09-18, DD 67-72 HDR.jpg \n | width2 = 142\n | alt2 = Pozna\u0144 City Hall\n | caption2 = [[Ratusz]], the 16th-century [[Renaissance in Poland|Renaissance]] City Hall in [[Pozna\u0144]] designed by Italian masters.\n}}\n\nHistory has not been kind to Poland's architectural monuments. Nonetheless, a number of ancient structures has survived: castles, churches, and stately homes, often unique in the regional or European context. Some of them have been painstakingly restored, like [[Wawel Castle]], or completely reconstructed, including the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] and [[Royal Castle in Warsaw|Royal Castle]] of Warsaw and the Old Town of [[Gda\u0144sk]].\n\nThe architecture of Gda\u0144sk is mostly of the Hanseatic variety, a Gothic style common among the former trading cities along the Baltic sea and in the northern part of Central Europe. The architectural style of [[Wroc\u0142aw]] is mainly representative of German architecture, since it was for centuries located within the Holy Roman Empire. The centres of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] and [[Sandomierz]] on the [[Vistula]] are good examples of well-preserved medieval towns. Poland's ancient capital, [[Krak\u00f3w]], ranks among the best-preserved [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe.\n\nThe second half of the 17th century is marked by [[baroque]] architecture. Side towers, such as those of [[Branicki Palace, Bia\u0142ystok|Branicki Palace]] in Bia\u0142ystok, are typical for the Polish baroque. The classical [[Silesian architecture|Silesian baroque]] is represented by the University in Wroc\u0142aw. The profuse decorations of the [[Branicki Palace, Warsaw|Branicki Palace]] in Warsaw are characteristic of the [[rococo]] style. The centre of Polish classicism was Warsaw under the rule of the last Polish king [[Stanis\u0142aw II Augustus]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stanley|first=John|year=2004|title=Reviewed Work: Literary Activities and Attitudes in the Stanislavian Age in Poland (1764\u20131795): A Social System? by Jan I.J. van der Meer|journal=Canadian Slavonic Papers|volume=46|issue=1/2|pages=226\u2013229|jstor=40870954|subscription=true}}</ref>\nThe [[\u0141azienki Palace|Palace on the Water]] is the most notable example of Polish [[neoclassical architecture]].

Over decades, Poland has produced outstanding directors, film producers, cartoonists and actors that achieved world fame, especially in [[Hollywood]]. Moreover, Polish inventors played an important role in the development of world cinematography and modern-day television. Among the most famous directors and producers, who worked in Poland as well as abroad are [[Roman Pola\u0144ski]], [[Andrzej Wajda]], [[Samuel Goldwyn]], the [[Warner Brothers|Warner brothers]] ([[Harry Warner|Harry]], [[Albert Warner|Albert]],  [[Sam Warner|Sam]], and [[Jack L. Warner|Jack]]), [[Max Fleischer]], [[Lee Strasberg]], [[Agnieszka Holland]] and [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]].\n\nIn the 19th century, throughout partitioned Poland, numerous amateur inventors, such as [[Kazimierz Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski]], were eager to construct a film projector. In 1894, Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski was successful in creating a [[Pleograph]], one of the first cameras in the world. The invention, which took photographs and projected pictures, was built before the [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] lodged their patent.<ref name=\"culture.pl\">{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/en/article/a-foreigners-guide-to-polish-cinema|title=A Foreigner's Guide to Polish Cinema |publisher=Culture.pl|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> He also patented an [[Aeroscope]], the first successful hand-held operated film camera. In 1897, [[Jan Szczepanik]], obtained a British patent for his [[Telectroscope]]. This prototype of television could easily transmit image and sound, thus allowing a live remote view. Following the invention of appropriate apparatus and technological development in the upcoming years, his then-impossible concept became reality.<ref name=\"culture.pl\"/>\n\n[[File:Andrzej Wajda 1974.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andrzej Wajda]] was one of the greatest Polish film directors, and the recipient of a [[Honorary Oscar]], the [[Palme d'Or]], as well as Honorary [[Golden Lion]] and [[Golden Bear]] Awards.]]\n\nPolish cinema developed rapidly in the [[interwar period]]. The most renowned star of the [[silent film]] era was Polish actress [[Pola Negri]]. During this time, the [[Yiddish cinema]] also evolved in Poland. Films in the [[Yiddish language]] with Jewish themes, such as ''[[The Dybbuk (film)|The Dybbuk]]'' (1937), played an important part in pre-war Polish cinematography. In 1945 the government established '[[Film Polski]]', a state-run film production and distribution organization, with director [[Aleksander Ford]] as the head of the company. Ford's ''[[Knights of the Teutonic Order (film)|Knights of the Teutonic Order]]'' (1960) was viewed by millions of people in the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and France.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.phil.muni.cz/dedur/?lang=1&id=964|title=Film Culture: Brno 1945\u20131970.

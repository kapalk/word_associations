Its western border is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; it shares land borders with [[Zambia]] and [[Angola]] to the north, [[Botswana]] to the east and [[South Africa]] to the south and east. Although [[Kazungula|it does not]] border [[Zimbabwe]], less than 200 metres of the [[Zambezi|Zambezi River]] (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the [[Namibian War of Independence]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Windhoek]], and it is a member state of the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), the [[African Union]] (AU), and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nNamibia, the driest country in Sub-Saharan Africa,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/23/world/africa/namibia-eye-on-country-profile/index.html |title=Namibia country profile: moving on from a difficult past |author=Peter Shadbolt |website=CNN |date=24 October 2012}}</ref> was inhabited since early times by the [[San people|San]], [[Damara people|Damara]], and [[Nama people]]s. Around the 14th century, [[immigrating]] [[Bantu peoples]] arrived as part of the [[Bantu expansion]]. Since then, the Bantu groups, one of which is known as the [[Ovambo people]], have dominated the population of the country; since the late 19th century, they have constituted a majority.\n\nIn 1878, the [[Cape Colony|Cape of Good Hope]], then a British colony, had annexed the port of [[Walvis Bay]] and the offshore [[Penguin Islands]]; these became an integral part of the new [[Union of South Africa]] at its creation in 1910. In 1884 the [[German Empire]] established rule over most of the territory as a protectorate (''Schutzgebiet''). It began to develop infrastructure and farming and maintained this German colony until 1915, when South African forces defeated its military. In 1920, after the end of [[World War I]], the [[League of Nations]] mandated the country to the United Kingdom, under administration by South Africa. It imposed its laws, including racial classifications and rules.\n\nFrom 1948, with the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] elected to power, South Africa applied [[apartheid]] also to what was then known as [[South West Africa]].\n\nIn the later 20th century, uprisings and demands for political representation by native African political activists seeking independence resulted in the UN assuming direct responsibility over the territory in 1966, but South Africa maintained ''de facto'' rule. In 1973 the UN recognised the South West Africa People's Organisation ([[SWAPO]]) as the official representative of the Namibian people; the party is dominated by the Ovambo, who are a large plurality in the territory. Following continued guerrilla warfare, South Africa installed an interim administration in Namibia in 1985. Namibia obtained full independence from South Africa in 1990. However, [[Walvis Bay]] and the [[Penguin Islands]] remained under South African control until 1994.\n\nNamibia has a population of 2.6&nbsp;million people and a stable [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[parliamentary democracy]]. Agriculture, [[herding]], [[Tourism in Namibia|tourism]] and the [[Mineral industry of Namibia|mining industry]]&nbsp;\u2013 including mining for gem diamonds, [[Uranium mining|uranium]], [[Gold mining|gold]], [[Silver mining|silver]], and [[base metal]]s&nbsp;\u2013 form the basis of its [[Economy of Namibia|economy]]. The large, arid [[Namib Desert]] has resulted in Namibia being overall one of the [[List of countries and territories by population density|least densely populated]] countries in the world.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the country is derived from the [[Namib Desert]], considered to be the oldest desert in the world.<ref name=at1315>Spriggs, A. (2001) {{WWF ecoregion|name=Africa: Namibia|id=at1315}}</ref> The name, ''Namib'' itself, is of [[nama language|Nama]] origin and means \"vast place\". Before its independence in 1990, the area was known first as [[German South-West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika''), then as South-West Africa, reflecting the colonial occupation by the Germans and the South Africans (technically on behalf of the British crown reflecting South Africa's dominion status within the British Empire).\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n\n===Pre-colonial period===\n[[File:Buschmannkinder.jpg|thumb|[[San people]] are Namibia's oldest [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] inhabitants.]]\nThe dry lands of Namibia have been inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Nama. Around the 14th century, immigrating [[Bantu people]] began to arrive during the [[Bantu expansion]] from central Africa.\n\nFrom the late 18th century onward, [[Oorlam people]] from Cape Colony crossed the [[Orange River]] and moved into the area that today is southern Namibia.<ref name=\"KDA\">{{cite web |url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015021238/http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_A.htm |archivedate=15 October 2008 |last=Dierks |first=Klaus |authorlink=Klaus Dierks |title=Biographies of Namibian Personalities, A |accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref> Their encounters with the nomadic Nama tribes were largely peaceful.

The Nama-Herero War broke out in 1880, with hostilities ebbing only after the [[German Empire]] deployed troops to the contested places and cemented the status quo among the Nama, Oorlam, and Herero.{{sfn|Vedder|1997|p=659}}\n\nThe first Europeans to disembark and explore the region were the Portuguese navigators [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] in 1485 and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in 1486, but the Portuguese crown did not try to claim the area. Like most of interior [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], Namibia was not extensively explored by Europeans until the 19th century. At that time traders and settlers came principally from Germany and Sweden. In the late 19th century, [[Dorsland Trek]]kers crossed the area on their way from the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] to [[Angola]]. Some of them settled in Namibia instead of continuing their journey.\n\n===German rule===\n{{see also|German South West Africa|Herero and Namaqua genocide}}\n[[File:Kirche denkmal nam.jpg|thumb|German church and monument to colonists in Windhoek, Namibia.]]\nNamibia became a German colony in 1884 under [[Otto von Bismarck]] to forestall perceived British encroachment and was known as [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika'').<ref>{{cite web|title=German South West Africa|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036573/German-South-West-Africa|accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref> However, the [[Palgrave Commission]] by the British governor in Cape Town had determined that only the natural deep-water harbor of [[Walvis Bay]] was worth occupying and thus annexed it to the Cape province of British South Africa.\n\nFrom 1904 to 1907, the [[Herero people|Herero]] and the [[Nama people|Namaqua]] [[Herero Wars|took up arms]] against brutal German colonialism.

The German military governor [[Lothar von Trotha]] issued an explicit extermination order, and many Herero died of disease and abuse in detention camps after being taken from their land. A substantial minority of Herero crossed the Kalahari desert into the British colony of Bechuanaland (modern-day [[Botswana]]), where a small community continues to live in western Botswana near to border with Namibia.

During German rule, the newspapers mainly reflected the living reality and the view of the white German-speaking minority. The black majority was ignored or depicted as a threat. During South African rule, the white bias continued, with mentionable influence of the Pretoria government on the \"South West African\" media system. Independent newspapers were seen as a menace to the existing order, and critical journalists were often threatened.<ref name=Rothe/><ref>von Nahmen, Carsten (2001): Deutschsprachige Medien in Namibia</ref><ref name=Links>Links, Frederico (2006): We write what we like: The role of independent print media and independent reporting in Namibia</ref>\n\nCurrent daily newspapers are the private publications ''[[The Namibian]]'' (English and other languages), ''[[Die Republikein]]'' (Afrikaans), [[Allgemeine Zeitung (Namibia)|Allgemeine Zeitung]] (German) and ''[[Namibian Sun]]'' (English) as well as the state-owned ''[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]]'' (predominantly English).

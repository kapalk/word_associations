Located on the [[equator]], Gabon is bordered by [[Equatorial Guinea]] to the northwest, [[Cameroon]] to the north, the [[Republic of the Congo]] on the east and south, and the [[Gulf of Guinea]] to the west. It has an area of nearly {{convert|270000|sqkm}} and its population is estimated at {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Gabon}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}} million people. Its capital and largest city is [[Libreville]].\n\nSince its independence from France in 1960, the [[sovereign state]] of Gabon has had [[List of heads of state of Gabon|three presidents]]. In the early 1990s, Gabon introduced a multi-party system and a new democratic constitution that allowed for a more transparent electoral process and reformed many governmental institutions.\n\nAbundant petroleum and foreign private investment have helped make Gabon one of the most prosperous countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], with the [[List of African countries by Human Development Index|7th highest]] [[Human Development Index|HDI]]<ref name=\"HDI\" /> and the [[List of African countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|fourth highest]] GDP per capita (PPP) (after [[Mauritius]], [[Equatorial Guinea]] and [[Seychelles]]) in the region. GDP grew by more than 6% per year from 2010 to 2012. However, because of [[Economic inequality|inequality]] in income distribution, a significant proportion of the population remains poor.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nGabon's name originates from ''gab\u00e3o'', [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for \"cloak\", which is roughly the shape of the [[estuary]] of the [[Komo River]] by Libreville.\n\n== History ==\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:1670 Ogilby Map of West Africa ( Gold Coast, Slave Coast, Ivory Coast ) - Geographicus - Guinea-ogilby-1670.jpg|thumb|left|A map of [[West Africa]] in 1670]]\n{{main|History of Gabon|French Equatorial Africa}}\n\nThe earliest inhabitants of the area were [[Congo Pygmies|Pygmy peoples]]. They were largely replaced and absorbed by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] tribes as [[Bantu expansion|they migrated]].\n\nIn the 15th century, the first Europeans arrived. By the 18th century, a [[Myene language|Myeni]] speaking kingdom known as [[Orungu Kingdom|Orungu]] formed in Gabon.\n\nOn February 10, 1722, [[Bartholomew Roberts]], a Welsh pirate known as Black Bart, died at sea off [[Cape Lopez]]. He raided ships off the Americas and West Africa from 1719 to 1722.\n\nFrench explorer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]] led his first mission to the Gabon-Congo area in 1875. He founded the town of [[Franceville]], and was later colonial governor. Several Bantu groups lived in the area that is now Gabon when France officially occupied it in 1885.\n\nIn 1910, Gabon became one of the four territories of [[French Equatorial Africa]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13376333|title=Gabon country profile|date=September 24, 2018|website=BBC News|access-date=24 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925030921/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13376333#|archive-date=25 September 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref> a federation that survived until 1959. In [[World War II]], the Allies [[Battle of Gabon|invaded]] Gabon in order to overthrow the pro-[[Vichy France]] colonial administration. The territories of French Equatorial Africa became independent on August 17, 1960. The first president of Gabon, elected in 1961, was [[L\u00e9on M'ba]], with [[Omar Bongo Ondimba]] as his vice president.\n\nAfter M'ba's accession to power, the press was suppressed, political demonstrations banned, [[freedom of expression]] curtailed, other political parties gradually excluded from power, and the Constitution changed along French lines to vest power in the Presidency, a post that M'ba assumed himself. However, when M'ba dissolved the [[National Assembly (Gabon)|National Assembly]] in January 1964 to institute one-party rule, [[1964 Gabonese coup d'\u00e9tat|an army coup sought to oust him from power]] and restore parliamentary democracy. French paratroopers flew in within 24 hours to restore M'ba to power.\n\nAfter a few days of fighting, the coup ended and the opposition was imprisoned, despite widespread protests and riots. French soldiers still remain in the [[Camp de Gaulle]] on the outskirts of Gabon's capital to this day. When M'Ba died in 1967, Bongo replaced him as president.\n\n[[File:Gabon campaign '1e Compagnie de Chars de Combat de la France Libre'.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Gabon]] resulted in the [[Free French Forces]] taking the colony of Gabon from [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] forces, 1940]]\nIn March 1968, Bongo declared Gabon a one-party state by dissolving the BDG and establishing a new party\u2014the [[Parti Democratique Gabonais]] (PDG). He invited all Gabonese, regardless of previous political affiliation, to participate. Bongo sought to forge a single national movement in support of the government's development policies, using the PDG as a tool to submerge the regional and tribal rivalries that had divided Gabonese politics in the past. Bongo was elected President in February 1975; in April 1975, the position of vice president was abolished and replaced by the position of prime minister, who had no right to automatic succession. Bongo was re-elected President in both December 1979 and November 1986 to 7-year terms.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn early 1990 economic discontent and a desire for political liberalization provoked violent demonstrations and strikes by students and workers. In response to grievances by workers, Bongo negotiated with them on a sector-by-sector basis, making significant wage concessions. In addition, he promised to open up the PDG and to organize a national political conference in March\u2013April 1990 to discuss Gabon's future political system. The PDG and 74 political organizations attended the conference. Participants essentially divided into two loose coalitions, the ruling PDG and its allies, and the United Front of Opposition Associations and Parties, consisting of the breakaway Morena Fundamental and the [[Gabonese Progress Party]].<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe April 1990 conference approved sweeping political reforms, including creation of a national [[Senate (Gabon)|Senate]], decentralization of the budgetary process, freedom of assembly and press, and cancellation of an [[exit visa]] requirement. In an attempt to guide the political system's transformation to multiparty democracy, Bongo resigned as PDG chairman and created a transitional government headed by a new Prime Minister, [[Casimir Oye-Mba]]. The Gabonese Social Democratic Grouping (RSDG), as the resulting government was called, was smaller than the previous government and included representatives from several opposition parties in its cabinet. The RSDG drafted a provisional constitution in May 1990 that provided a basic [[bill of rights]] and an independent judiciary but retained strong executive powers for the president. After further review by a constitutional committee and the National Assembly, this document came into force in March 1991.<ref name=bn/>\n\nOpposition to the PDG continued after the April 1990 conference, however, and in September 1990, two [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] attempts were uncovered and aborted. Despite anti-government demonstrations after the untimely death of an opposition leader, the first multiparty National Assembly elections in almost 30 years took place in September\u2013October 1990, with the PDG garnering a large majority.<ref name=bn/>\n\n[[File:Omar Bongo with George Bush May 26 2004-01.jpg|thumb|President [[George W. Bush]] welcomes President [[Omar Bongo]] to the [[Oval Office]], May 2004]]\nFollowing President [[Omar Bongo]]'s re-election in December 1993 with 51% of the vote, opposition candidates refused to validate the election results. Serious civil disturbances and violent repression led to an agreement between the government and opposition factions to work toward a political settlement. These talks led to the Paris Accords in November 1994, under which several opposition figures were included in a government of national unity. This arrangement soon broke down, however, and the 1996 and 1997 legislative and municipal elections provided the background for renewed partisan politics. The PDG won a landslide victory in the legislative election, but several major cities, including [[Libreville]], elected opposition mayors during the 1997 local election.<ref name=bn/>\n\nFacing a divided opposition, President Omar Bongo coasted to easy re-election in December 1998, with large majorities of the vote. While Bongo's major opponents rejected the outcome as fraudulent, some international observers characterized the results as representative despite many perceived irregularities, and there were none of the civil disturbances that followed the 1993 election. Peaceful though flawed legislative elections held in 2001\u20132002, which were boycotted by a number of smaller opposition parties and were widely criticized for their administrative weaknesses, produced a National Assembly almost completely dominated by the PDG and allied independents. In November 2005 President Omar Bongo was elected for his sixth term. He won re-election easily, but opponents claim that the balloting process was marred by irregularities. There were some instances of violence following the announcement of his win, but Gabon generally remained peaceful.<ref name=bn/>\n\nNational Assembly elections were held again in December 2006. Several seats contested because of voting irregularities were overturned by the [[Constitutional Court of Gabon|Constitutional Court]], but the subsequent run-off elections in early 2007 again yielded a PDG-controlled National Assembly.<ref name=bn/>\n\n[[File:Independence Celebration in Gabon.JPG|thumb|Independence Day celebration in Gabon]]\nOn June 8, 2009, President Omar Bongo died of cardiac arrest at a Spanish hospital in Barcelona, ushering in a new era in Gabonese politics. In accordance with the amended constitution, [[Rose Francine Rogomb\u00e9]], the President of the Senate, became Interim President on June 10, 2009. The first contested elections in Gabon's history that did not include Omar Bongo as a candidate were held on August 30, 2009 with 18 candidates for president. The lead-up to the elections saw some isolated protests, but no significant disturbances. Omar Bongo's son, ruling party leader [[Ali Bongo Ondimba]], was formally declared the winner after a 3-week review by the Constitutional Court; his inauguration took place on October 16, 2009.<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe court's review had been prompted by claims of fraud by the many opposition candidates, with the initial announcement of election results sparking unprecedented violent protests in [[Port-Gentil]], the country's second-largest city and a long-time bastion of opposition to PDG rule. The citizens of Port-Gentil took to the streets, and numerous shops and residences were burned, including the French Consulate and a local prison. Officially, only four deaths occurred during the riots, but opposition and local leaders claim many more. Gendarmes and the military were deployed to Port-Gentil to support the beleaguered police, and a curfew was in effect for more than three months.<ref name=bn/>\n\nA partial legislative by-election was held in June 2010. A newly created coalition of parties, the Union Nationale (UN), participated for the first time. The UN is composed largely of PDG defectors who left the party after [[Omar Bongo]]'s death. Of the five hotly contested seats, the PDG won three and the UN won two; both sides claimed victory.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn January 2019, there was an [[2019 Gabonese coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|attempted coup d'\u00e9tat]] led by soldiers against the President [[Ali Bongo Ondimba|Ali Bongo]]; the current status is still unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bnonews.com/index.php/2019/01/military-coup-underway-in-gabon/|title=Soldiers in Gabon try to seize power in failed coup attempt|website=Bnonews.com|date=January 7, 2019|accessdate=January 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107084533/https://bnonews.com/index.php/2019/01/military-coup-underway-in-gabon/|archive-date=January 7, 2019|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Government ==\n[[File:Ali Bongo Ondimba with Obamas 2014.jpg|thumb|[[Ali Bongo Ondimba]], President of the Gabonese Republic, his wife Sylvia Bongo Ondimba, US president [[Barack Obama]] and his wife [[Michelle Obama]] in 2014]]\n{{main|Politics of Gabon}}\n\nGabon is a republic with a presidential form of government under the 1961 constitution (revised in 1975, rewritten in 1991, and revised in 2003). The president is elected by universal suffrage for a seven-year term; a 2003 constitutional amendment removed presidential term limits and facilitated a presidency for life. The president can appoint and dismiss the prime minister, the cabinet, and judges of the independent Supreme Court. The president also has other strong powers, such as authority to dissolve the National Assembly, declare a state of siege, delay legislation, and conduct referenda.<ref name=bn/>\n\nGabon has a bicameral legislature with a National Assembly and Senate. The National Assembly has 120 deputies who are popularly elected for a 5-year term. The Senate is composed of 102 members who are elected by municipal councils and regional assemblies and serve for 6 years. The Senate was created in the 1990\u20131991 constitutional revision, although it was not brought into being until after the 1997 local elections. The President of the Senate is next in succession to the President.<ref name=bn/>\n\nDespite the democratic system of government, the ''[[Freedom in the World]]'' report lists Gabon as \"not free\", and elections in 2016 have been disputed.\n\n=== Political culture ===\nIn 1990, the government made major changes to Gabon's political system. A transitional constitution was drafted in May 1990 as an outgrowth of the national political conference in March\u2013April and later revised by a constitutional committee. Among its provisions were a Western-style bill of rights, creation of a National Council of Democracy to oversee the guarantee of those rights, a governmental advisory board on economic and social issues, and an independent judiciary.<ref name=bn/>\n\nAfter approval by the National Assembly, the PDG Central Committee, and the President, the Assembly unanimously adopted the constitution in March 1991. Multiparty legislative elections were held in 1990\u201391, despite the fact that opposition parties had not been declared formally legal. In spite of this, the elections produced the first representative, multiparty National Assembly. In January 1991, the Assembly passed by unanimous vote a law governing the legalization of opposition parties.<ref name=bn/>\n\nAfter President Omar Bongo was re-elected in 1993, in a disputed election where only 51% of votes were cast, social and political disturbances led to the 1994 Paris Conference and Accords. These provided a framework for the next elections. Local and legislative elections were delayed until 1996\u201397. In 1997, constitutional amendments put forward years earlier were adopted to create the Senate and the position of vice president, as well as to extend the president's term to seven years.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn October 2009, newly elected President Ali Bongo Ondimba began efforts to streamline the government. In an effort to reduce corruption and government bloat, he eliminated 17 minister-level positions, abolished the vice presidency and reorganized the portfolios of numerous ministries, bureaus and directorates. In November 2009, President Bongo Ondimba announced a new vision for the modernization of Gabon, called \"Gabon Emergent\". This program contains three pillars: Green Gabon, Service Gabon, and Industrial Gabon. The goals of Gabon Emergent are to diversify the economy so that Gabon becomes less reliant on petroleum, to eliminate corruption, and to modernize the workforce. Under this program, exports of raw timber have been banned, a government-wide census was held, the work day has been changed to eliminate a long midday break, and a national oil company was created.<ref name=bn/>\n\nIn provisional results,{{when|date=December 2012}} the ruling [[Gabonese Democratic Party]] (PDG) won 84 out of 120 parliamentary seats.\n\nOn January 25, 2011, opposition leader [[Andr\u00e9 Mba Obame]] claimed the presidency, saying the country should be run by someone the people really wanted. He also selected 19 ministers for his government, and the entire group, along with hundreds of others, spent the night at UN headquarters. On January 26, the government dissolved Mba Obame's party. AU chairman [[Jean Ping]] said that Mba Obame's action \"hurts the integrity of legitimate institutions and also endangers the peace, the security and the stability of Gabon.\"<ref name=Goma>{{cite news|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_GABON?SITE=NCWIN&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT |title=Gabon opposition leader declares himself president |last=Goma |first=Yves Laurent |work=[[Winston-Salem Journal]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=January 26, 2011 |accessdate=January 26, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Interior Minister Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ndongou accused Mba Obame and his supporters of [[treason]].<ref name=Goma/> The UN Secretary-General, [[Ban Ki-moon]], said that he recognized Ondimba as the only official Gabonese president.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nThe [[Gabonese presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] was disputed, with very close official results reported.

In inter-African affairs, Gabon espouses development by evolution rather than revolution and favors regulated private enterprise as the system most likely to promote rapid economic growth. Gabon played an important leadership role in the stability of Central Africa through involvement in mediation efforts in [[Chad]], the [[Central African Republic]], [[Angola]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (D.R.C.), and [[Burundi]].\n\nIn December 1999, through the mediation efforts of President Bongo, a peace accord was signed in the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville) between the government and most leaders of an armed rebellion. President Bongo was also involved in the continuing D.R.C. peace process, and played a role in mediating the crisis in [[Ivory Coast]]. Gabonese armed forces were also an integral part of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC) mission to the Central African Republic.\n\n[[File:US Navy 080107-N-4044H-049 Capt.

The coastal plains form a large section of the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]] and contain patches of [[Central African mangroves]] especially on the [[Muni River]] estuary on the border with [[Equatorial Guinea]].\n\nGeologically, Gabon is primarily ancient [[Archean]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]] igneous and metamorphic basement rock, belonging to the stable continental crust of the [[Congo Craton]], a remnant section of extremely old continental crust. Some formations are more than two billion years old. Ancient rock units are overlain by marine [[carbonate]], lacustrine and continental sedimentary rocks as well as unconsolidated sediments and soils that formed in the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. The rifting apart of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] created rift basins that filled with sediments and formed the hydrocarbons which are now a keystone of the Gabonese economy.<ref>{{cite book |author=Schluter, Thomas |year=2006|title=Geological Atlas of Africa|publisher=Springer|p=110\u2013112}}</ref> Gabon is notable for the Oklo reactor zones, the only known [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] on Earth which was active two billion years ago.

Gabon has three [[Karst topography|karst]] areas where there are hundreds of caves located in the dolomite and limestone rocks.

In 2002, President Omar Bongo Ondimba designated roughly 10% of the nation's territory to be part of its [[List of national parks of Gabon|national park system]] (with 13 parks in total), one of the largest proportions of [[nature park]]land in the world. The [[National Agency for National Parks]] manages Gabon's national park system.\n\nNatural resources include petroleum, magnesium, iron, gold, uranium, and forests.\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:Gabon Export Treemap.jpg|thumb|A proportional representation of Gabon's exports]]\n{{main|Economy of Gabon}}\n\nGabon's economy is dominated by oil. [[Oil revenue]]s constitute roughly 46% of the government's budget, 43% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and 81% of exports. Oil production is currently declining rapidly from its high point of 370,000 barrels per day in 1997. Some estimates suggest that Gabonese oil will be expended by 2025. In spite of the decreasing oil revenues, planning is only now beginning for an after-oil scenario.<ref name=bn>[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2826.htm Background note: Gabon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623233827/https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2826.htm# |date=June 23, 2017 }}.

Overspending on the [[Trans-Gabon Railway]], the CFA franc devaluation of 1994, and periods of low oil prices caused serious debt problems that still plague the country.<ref name=bn/>\n\nGabon earned a poor reputation with the [[Paris Club]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) over the management of its debt and revenues. Successive IMF missions have criticized the government for overspending on off-budget items (in good years and bad), over-borrowing from the [[Central Bank]], and slipping on the schedule for [[privatization]] and administrative reform. However, in September 2005 Gabon successfully concluded a 15-month Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF. Another 3-year Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF was approved in May 2007. Because of the financial crisis and social developments surrounding the death of President Omar Bongo and the elections, Gabon was unable to meet its economic goals under the Stand-By Arrangement in 2009. Negotiations with the IMF were ongoing.<ref name=bn/>\n\nGabon's oil revenues have given it a per capita GDP of $8,600, unusually high for the region. However, a skewed income distribution and poor social indicators are evident.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook//fields/2116.html#gb|title=The World Factbook|website=Cia.gov|access-date=2016-03-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315024427/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2116.html#gb#gb|archive-date=March 15, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The richest 20% of the population earn over 90% of the income while about a third of the Gabonese population lives in poverty.<ref name=bn/>\n\nThe economy is highly dependent on extraction, but primary materials are abundant. Before the discovery of oil, logging was the pillar of the Gabonese economy. Today, logging and manganese mining are the next-most-important income generators. Recent explorations suggest the presence of the world's largest unexploited iron ore deposit. For many who live in rural areas without access to employment opportunity in extractive industries, remittances from family members in urban areas or subsistence activities provide income.<ref name=bn/>\n\nForeign and local observers have lamented the lack of diversity in the Gabonese economy. Various factors have so far limited the development of new industries:\n* the market is small, about a million\n* dependent on imports from France\n* unable to capitalize on regional markets\n* entrepreneurial zeal not always present among the Gabonese\n* a fairly regular stream of oil \"rent\", even if it is diminishing\n\nFurther investment in the agricultural or [[Tourism in Gabon|tourism]] sectors is complicated by poor infrastructure. The small processing and service sectors that do exist are largely dominated by a few prominent local investors.<ref name=bn/>\n\nAt World Bank and IMF insistence, the government embarked in the 1990s on a program of privatization of its state-owned companies and administrative reform, including reducing public sector employment and salary growth, but progress has been slow.

More than 10,000 native French live in Gabon, including an estimated 2,000 dual nationals.<ref name=bn/>\n\nEthnic boundaries are less sharply drawn in Gabon than elsewhere in [[Africa]]. Most ethnicities are spread throughout Gabon, leading to constant contact and interaction among the groups, and there is no ethnic tension. One important reason for this is that intermarriage is extremely common and every Gabonese person is connected by blood to many different tribes. Indeed, intermarriage is often required because among many tribes, marriage within the same tribe is prohibited because it is regarded as incest. This is because those tribes consist of the descendants of a specific ancestor, and therefore all members of the tribe are regarded as close kin to each other (identical to the clan system of [[Scotland]] or the [[Gotra]] system in the Hindu caste system). French, the language of its former colonial ruler, is a unifying force. The Democratic Party of Gabon (PDG)'s historical dominance also has served to unite various ethnicities and local interests into a larger whole.\n\n=== Population centres ===\n{{Further|List of cities in Gabon}}\n[[File:Front de mer.jpg|thumb|Libreville]]\n[[File:Park In Gabon.JPG|thumb|People in Libreville]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  \n|-\n| colspan=\"6\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:orange;\"| '''Cities of Gabon'''\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#98fb98;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\"| '''Order''' || rowspan=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#98fb98;\"| '''City''' || colspan=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#98fb98;\"| '''Population''' || rowspan=\"2\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#98fb98;\"| '''Province'''\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#98fb98;\"\n|| '''2003 Census<ref name=\"citypopulation.de\">{{cite web|url=http://citypopulation.de/Gabon-Cities.html|title=Gabon: Provinces, Cities & Urban Places - Population Statistics in Maps and Charts|website=Citypopulation.de|accessdate=January 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724005941/http://citypopulation.de/Gabon-Cities.html|archive-date=July 24, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}</ref>''' ||  style=\"text-align:center; background:#98fb98;\"| '''2013 census<ref name=\"citypopulation.de\"/>'''\n|-\n|align=right | 1. || [[Libreville]] || align=right | 538,195 || align=right | 703,940 || [[Estuaire Province|Estuaire]]\n|-\n|align=right | 2. || [[Port-Gentil]] || align=right | 105,712 || align=right | 136,462 || [[Ogoou\u00e9-Maritime]]\n|-\n|align=right | 3. || [[Franceville]] || align=right | 103,840 || align=right | 110,568 || [[Haut-Ogoou\u00e9]]\n|-\n|align=right | 4. || [[Owendo]] || align=right | 51,661 || align=right | 79,300 || [[Estuaire Province|Estuaire]]\n|-\n|align=right | 5. || [[Oyem]] || align=right | 35,241 || align=right | 60,685 || [[Woleu-Ntem]]\n|-\n|align=right | 6. || [[Moanda]] || align=right | 42,703 || align=right | 59,154 || [[Haut-Ogoou\u00e9]]\n|-\n|align=right | 7. || [[Ntoum]] || align=right | 12,711 || align=right | 51,954 || [[Estuaire Province|Estuaire]]\n|-\n|align=right | 8. || [[Lambar\u00e9n\u00e9]] || align=right | 24,883 || align=right | 38,775 || [[Moyen-Ogoou\u00e9]]\n|-\n|align=right | 9. || [[Mouila]] || align=right | 21,074 || align=right | 36,061 || [[Ngouni\u00e9]]\n|-\n|align=right | 10. || [[Akanda]] || align=right | - || align=right | 34,548 || [[Akanda]]\n|}\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Further|Languages of Gabon}}\n\nIt is [[African French#note-2007 report|estimated that 80%]] of Gabon's population can speak French, and that 30% of Libreville residents are native speakers of the language.

Color television broadcasts have been introduced in major cities. In 1981, a commercial radio station, Africa No. 1, began operations. The most powerful radio station on the continent, it has participation from the French and Gabonese governments and private European media.\n\nIn 2004, the government operated two radio stations and another seven were privately owned. There were also two government television stations and four privately owned. In 2003, there were an estimated 488 radios and 308 television sets for every 1,000 people. About 11.5 of every 1,000 people were cable subscribers. Also in 2003, there were 22.4 personal computers for every 1,000 people and 26 of every 1,000 people had access to the [[Internet]]. The national press service is the Gabonese Press Agency, which publishes a daily paper, ''Gabon-Matin'' (circulation 18,000 as of 2002).\n\n''[[L'Union]]'' in Libreville, the government-controlled daily newspaper, had an average daily circulation of 40,000 in 2002. The weekly ''Gabon d'Aujourdhui'' is published by the Ministry of Communications. There are about nine privately owned periodicals which are either independent or affiliated with political parties. These publish in small numbers and are often delayed by financial constraints. The constitution of Gabon provides for free speech and a free press, and the government supports these rights. Several periodicals actively criticize the government and foreign publications are widely available.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Further|Gabonese cuisine}}\n\nGabonese cuisine is influenced by French cuisine, but [[staple foods]] are also available.<ref name=\"Foster\">Foster, Dean (2002).

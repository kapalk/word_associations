The area was named the [[Slave Coast of West Africa|\"Slave Coast\"]] because of this flourishing trade. Court protocols, which demanded that a portion of war captives from the kingdom's many battles be decapitated, decreased the number of enslaved people exported from the area.

Annual rainfall in the coastal area averages 1300&nbsp;mm or about 51&nbsp;inches. Benin has two rainy and two dry seasons per year. The principal rainy season is from April to late July, with a shorter less intense rainy period from late September to November. The main dry season is from December to April, with a short cooler dry season from late July to early September. Temperatures and humidity are high along the tropical coast. In [[Cotonou]], the average maximum temperature is {{convert|31|\u00b0C|1}}; the minimum is {{convert|24|\u00b0C|1}}.<ref name=bn/>\n\nVariations in temperature increase when moving north through [[savanna]] and plateau toward the [[Sahel]]. A dry wind from the Sahara called the [[Harmattan]] blows from December to March, when grass dries up, other vegetation turns reddish brown, and a veil of fine dust hangs over the country, causing the skies to be overcast.

Financial support comes from Benin's National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation. The Benin Agency for the Promotion of Research Results and Technological Innovation carries out technology transfer through the development and dissemination of research results.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe regulatory framework has evolved since 2006 till date when the country's first science policy was prepared. This has since been updated and complemented by new texts on science and innovation (the year of adoption is between brackets):<ref name=\":0\" />\n* a manual for monitoring and evaluating research structures and organizations (2013);\n* a manual on how to select research programmes and projects and apply to the National Fund for Scientific Research and Technological Innovation (2013) for competitive grants;\n* a draft act for funding scientific research and innovation and a draft code of ethics for scientific research and innovation were both submitted to the Supreme Court in 2014;\n* a strategic plan for scientific research and innovation (under development in 2015).\nEqually important are Benin's efforts to integrate science into existing policy documents:\n* ''Benin Development Strategies 2025'': ''Benin 2025 Alafia'' (2000);\n* Growt''h Strategy for Poverty Reduction 2011\u20132016'' (2011);\n* Phase 3 of the ''Ten-year Development Plan for the Education Sector'', covering 2013\u20132015;\n* ''Development Plan for Higher Education and Scientific Research 2013\u20132017'' (2014).\nIn 2015, Benin's priority areas for scientific research were: health, education, construction and building materials, transportation and trade, culture, tourism and handicrafts, cotton/textiles, food, energy and climate change.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe main challenges facing research and development in Benin are:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* the unfavorable organizational framework for research: weak governance, a lack of co-operation between research structures and the absence of an official document on the status of researchers;\n* the inadequate use of human resources and the lack of any motivational policy for researchers; and \n* the mismatch between research and development needs.\n\n=== Human and financial investment in research ===\nIn 2007, Benin counted 1,000 researchers (in headcounts). This corresponds to 115 researchers per million inhabitants.

They reiterated this goal in the ''Malabo Declaration'' adopted in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. In the latter declaration, they reaffirmed their 'intention to devote 10% of their national budgets to agricultural development and agreed to targets such as doubling agricultural productivity, halving post-harvest loss and bringing stunting down to 10% across Africa'.

In wealthier cities, however, French is usually taught at an earlier age. At the secondary School level, local language is generally forbidden and French is the sole language of instruction. Beninese languages are generally transcribed with a separate letter for each speech sound ([[phoneme]]), rather than using [[diacritic]]s as in French or [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] as in English. This includes Beninese [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], which in [[Nigeria]] is written with both diacritics and digraphs. For instance, the [[mid vowel]]s are written ''\u00e9 \u00e8, \u00f4, o'' in French are written ''{{IPA|e, \u025b, o, \u0254}}'' in Beninese languages, whereas the [[consonant]]s are written ''ng'' and ''sh'' or ''ch'' in English are written ''\u014b'' and ''c.'' However, digraphs are used for [[nasal vowel]]s and the [[labial-velar consonant]]s ''kp'' and ''gb,'' as in the name of the [[Fon language]] ''Fon gbe'' {{IPA|/f\u00f5 \u0261\u0361be/}}, and diacritics are used as [[tone (linguistics)|tone marks]]. In French-language publications, a mixture of French and Beninese orthographies may be seen.\n\n===Cuisine===\n[[File:Bahia acaraje.jpg|thumb|[[Acaraj\u00e9]] is peeled [[black-eyed pea]]s formed into a ball and then deep-fried.]]\n{{main|Benin cuisine}}\nBeninese cuisine is known in Africa for its exotic ingredients and flavorful dishes. Beninese cuisine involves fresh meals served with a variety of key sauces. In southern Benin cuisine, the most common ingredient is [[Maize|corn]], often used to prepare [[dough]] which is mainly served with [[peanut]]- or [[tomato]]-based [[sauce]]s. [[Fish]] and [[chicken]] are the most common meats used in southern Beninese cuisine, but [[beef]], [[goat]], and [[Aethomys|bush rat]] are also consumed. The main staple in northern Benin is [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often served with sauces mentioned above. The population in the northern provinces use beef and [[pork]] meat which is fried in palm or peanut oil or cooked in sauces. [[Cheese]] is used in some dishes. [[Couscous]], rice, and [[bean]]s are commonly eaten, along with fruits such as [[mango]]es, oranges, avocados, bananas, kiwi fruit, and pineapples.\n\nMeat is usually quite expensive, and meals are generally light on meat and generous on [[vegetable fat]]. Frying in palm or peanut oil is the most common meat preparation, and [[smoked fish]] is commonly prepared in Benin. Grinders are used to prepare [[Cornmeal|corn flour]], which is made into a dough and served with sauces. \"Chicken on the spit\" is a traditional recipe in which chicken is roasted over a fire on wooden sticks. [[Arecaceae|Palm]] roots are sometimes soaked in a jar with salt water and sliced garlic to tenderize them, then used in dishes. Many people have outdoor mud stoves for cooking.\n\n===Sports===\n[[Association football|Football]] is generally considered the most popular sport in Benin. In the past decade, [[baseball]] has been introduced to the country.<ref>Mozey, Brian.

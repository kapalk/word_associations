The independent [[Zeta under the Bal\u0161i\u0107i|Principality of Zeta]] emerged in the 14th and 15th centuries, ruled by the [[House of Bal\u0161i\u0107]] between 1356 and 1421, and by the [[House of Crnojevi\u0107]] between 1431 and 1498, when the name Montenegro started being used for the country. After falling under [[Montenegro Vilayet|Ottoman rule]], Montenegro regained ''de facto'' independence in 1697 under the rule of the [[House of Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]], first under the theocratic rule of [[Prince-Bishopric of Montenegro|prince-bishops]], before being transformed into a secular [[Principality of Montenegro|principality]] in 1852. Montenegro's ''[[de jure]]'' independence was recognised by the [[Great Powers]] at the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, following the [[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War]]. In 1905, the country became a [[Kingdom of Montenegro|kingdom]]. After [[World War I]], it became part of [[Yugoslavia]]. Following the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]], the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (1992\u20132006)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (1992\u20132006)|Montenegro]] together established a [[federation]] known as the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was renamed [[State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003. On the basis of an [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006|independence referendum]] held in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence and the federation peacefully dissolved on 3 June of that year.\n\nSince 1990, the [[sovereign state]] of Montenegro has been governed by the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] and its minor coalition partners. Classified by the [[World Bank]] as an upper middle-income country, Montenegro is a member of the [[UN]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], the [[Council of Europe]], and the [[Central European Free Trade Agreement]].

Montenegro further increased its size several times by the 20th century, as the result of wars against the [[Ottoman Empire]], which saw the annexation of [[Old Herzegovina]] and parts of [[Metohija]] and southern [[Ra\u0161ka (region)|Ra\u0161ka]]. Its borders have changed little since then, losing [[Metohija]] and gaining the [[Bay of Kotor]].\n \nAfter the second session of the [[Anti-Fascist Council for the National Liberation of Yugoslavia|AVNOJ]] during [[World War II in Yugoslavia]], the modern state of Montenegro was founded as the ''Federal State of Montenegro'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435 / ''Savezna dr\u017eava Crne Gore'') on 15 November 1943 within the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia by the [[State Anti-fascist Council for the National Liberation of Montenegro and Boka|ZAVNOCGB]]. After DF Yugoslavia became the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, the Federal State of Montenegro was renamed to the ''[[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|People's Republic of Montenegro]]'' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u041d\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Narodna Republika Crna Gora'') on 29 November 1945. In 1963, the FPRY was renamed to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and coincidentally, the People's Republic of Montenegro was renamed to the ''Socialist Republic of Montenegro''  ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: \u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0430 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0430 / ''Socijalisti\u010dka Republika Crna Gora'').

Over the next few decades, it expanded its territory to neighbouring Rascia and Bosnia, and also became recognised as a kingdom. Its power started declining at the beginning of the 12th century. After King Bodin's death (in 1101 or 1108), several civil wars ensued. Duklja reached its zenith under Vojislav's son, [[Mihailo I of Duklja|Mihailo]] (1046\u201381), and his grandson [[Constantine Bodin]] (1081\u20131101).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970116032145/http://www.montenegro.org/duklja.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 January 1997 |title=Duklja, the first Montenegrin state |publisher=Montenegro.org |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref> By the 13th century, ''Zeta'' had replaced ''Duklja'' when referring to the realm. In the late 14th century, southern Montenegro ([[Lordship of Zeta|Zeta]]) came under the rule of the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107 noble family]], then the [[Crnojevi\u0107 noble family]], and by the 15th century, Zeta was more often referred to as ''Crna Gora'' ([[Venetian language|Venetian]]: ''{{lang|vec|monte negro}}'').\n\nAs the nobility fought for the throne, the kingdom was weakened, and by 1186, it was conquered by [[Stefan Nemanja]] and incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Serbian realm]] as a province named Zeta. After the [[Serbian Empire]] collapsed in the second half of the 14th century, the most powerful Zetan family, the [[Bal\u0161i\u0107]]s, became sovereigns of Zeta.\n[[File:\u0423\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043a \u0426\u0440\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0430.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Montenegrin\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Uprising of Montenegrins against Ottomans]]]]\n\nIn 1421, Zeta was annexed to the [[Serbian Despotate]], but after 1455, another noble family from Zeta, the [[Crnojevi\u0107]]s, became sovereign rulers of the country, making it the last free monarchy of the Balkans before it fell to the [[Ottomans]] in 1496, and got annexed to the ''[[sanjak]]'' of [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. During the reign of Crnojevi\u0107s, Zeta became known under its current name&nbsp;\u2013 Montenegro. For a short time, Montenegro existed as a separate autonomous ''sanjak'' in 1514\u20131528 ([[Sanjak of Montenegro]]).

In the 16th century, Montenegro developed a unique form of autonomy within the Ottoman Empire permitting Montenegrin clans freedom from certain restrictions. Nevertheless, the Montenegrins were disgruntled with Ottoman rule, and in the 17th century, raised numerous rebellions, which culminated in the defeat of the Ottomans in the [[Great Turkish War]] at the end of that century.\n\nMontenegro consisted of territories controlled by warlike clans. Most clans had a chieftain (''knez''), who was not permitted to assume the title unless he proved to be as worthy a leader as his predecessor. The great assembly of Montenegrin clans (''Zbor'') was held every year on 12 July in Cetinje, and any adult clansman could take part.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nParts of the territory were controlled by [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[First French Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], its successors. In 1515, Montenegro became a [[theocracy]] led by the [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral]], which flourished after the [[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161]] of Cetinje became the traditional prince-bishops (whose title was \"Vladika of Montenegro\"). However, the [[Venetian Republic]] introduced governors who meddled in Montenegrin politics. The republic was succeeded by the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1797, and the governors were abolished by Prince-Bishop [[Petar II Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Petar II]] in 1832.

However, political rifts emerged between the reigning [[People's Party of Montenegro|People's Party]], who supported the process of democratization and union with Serbia, and those of the [[True People's Party]], who were monarchist.\n\nDuring this period, one of the major Montenegrin victories over the Ottomans occurred at the\n[[Battle of Grahovac]]. [[Mirko Petrovi\u0107 Njego\u0161|Grand Duke Mirko Petrovi\u0107]], elder brother of [[Knjaz Danilo]], led an army of 7,500 and defeated the numerically superior Ottomans who had 15,000 troops at [[Grahovac]] on 1 May 1858. The glory of Montenegrin victory was soon immortalized in the songs and literature of all the South Slavs, in particular the Montenegrins in Vojvodina, then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]. This forced the [[Great Powers]] to officially demarcate the borders between Montenegro and Ottoman Empire, de facto recognizing Montenegro's independence. Montenegro's independence was recognized by Ottoman Empire with the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nThe first Montenegrin constitution was proclaimed in 1855; it was also known as the Danilo Code.\n\n=== Kingdom of Montenegro (1910\u20131918) ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Montenegro}}\n\n[[File:Kralj i kraljica u krugu sire familije.jpg|thumb|[[Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161 dynasty|Royal family of Montenegro]]: King [[Nikola I Petrovi\u0107-Njego\u0161|Nicholas I]] with his wife, sons, daughters, grandchildren and sons- and daughters-in-law]]\n\nIn 1910, Montenegro became [[Kingdom of Montenegro|a kingdom]], and as a result of the [[Balkan wars]] in 1912 and 1913 (in which the Ottomans lost all Balkan land), a common border with Serbia was established, with [[Shkod\u00ebr]] being awarded to a newly created [[Albania]], though the current capital city of Montenegro, Podgorica, was the old border of Albania and Yugoslavia.\n\nMontenegro was among the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] during [[World War I]] (1914\u201318). From 1916 to October 1918, Montenegro was occupied by Austria-Hungary. During the occupation, King Nicholas fled the country and a government-in-exile was set up in [[Bordeaux]].\n\n=== Kingdom of Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Yugoslavia}}\n\nIn 1922, Montenegro formally became the [[Oblast of Cetinje]] in the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], with the addition of the coastal areas around [[Budva]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. In a further restructuring in 1929, it became a part of a larger [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta Banate]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] that reached the [[Neretva]] River.\n\nNicholas's grandson, the Serb King [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]], dominated the Yugoslav government. Zeta Banovina was one of nine banovinas which formed the kingdom; it consisted of the present-day Montenegro and parts of Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia.\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{Main|Italian governorate of Montenegro}}\n[[File:Crna Gora - Oslobodjenje od strane okupacije 1711-1918.png|thumb|left|Liberation of Montenegro from 1711 to 1918]]\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-185-0116-27A, Bucht von Kotor (-), jugoslawische Schiffe.jpg|thumb|Captured ships of the [[Royal Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslavian Navy]], [[Bay of Kotor]] 1941.]]\n[[File:Borbe za oslobo\u0111enje Crne Gore.jpg|thumb|Uprising in Montenegro 1944.]]\n\nIn April 1941, [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Italy]], and other Axis allies attacked and occupied the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Italian forces occupied Montenegro and established it as a puppet [[Italian governorate of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]].\n\nIn May, the Montenegrin branch of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia started preparations for an uprising planned for mid-July. The Communist Party and its Youth League organised 6,000 of its members into detachments prepared for [[guerrilla warfare]]. The first armed uprising in [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]]-occupied Europe happened on 13 July 1941 in Montenegro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.b92.net/info/vesti/index.php?yyyy=2010&mm=07&dd=13&nav_category=167&nav_id=445290 |title=Prema oceni istori\u010dara, Trinaestojulski ustanak bio je prvi i najmasovniji oru\u017eani otpor u porobljenoj Evropi 1941. godine |publisher=B92.net |language=Serbian |accessdate=7 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnexpectedly, the uprising took hold, and by 20 July, 32,000 men and women had joined the fight. Except for the coast and major towns (Podgorica, Cetinje, Pljevlja, and Nik\u0161i\u0107), which were besieged, Montenegro was mostly liberated. In a month of fighting, the Italian army suffered 5,000 dead, wounded, and captured. The uprising lasted until mid-August, when it was suppressed by a counter-offensive of 67,000 Italian troops brought in from Albania. Faced with new and overwhelming Italian forces, many of the fighters laid down their arms and returned home. Nevertheless, intense guerrilla fighting lasted until December.\n\nFighters who remained under arms fractured into two groups. Most of them went on to join the Yugoslav Partisans, consisting of communists and those inclined towards active resistance; these included [[Arso Jovanovi\u0107]], [[Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107 (Yugoslav Partisan)|Sava Kova\u010devi\u0107]], [[Svetozar Vukmanovi\u0107-Tempo]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Peko Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]], [[Veljko Vlahovi\u0107]], and [[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]]. Those loyal to the [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty]] and opposing communism went on to become [[Chetniks]], and turned to collaboration with Italians against the Partisans.\n\nWar broke out between Partisans and Chetniks during the first half of 1942. Pressured by Italians and Chetniks, the core of the Montenegrin Partisans went to Serbia and Bosnia, where they joined with other Yugoslav Partisans. Fighting between Partisans and Chetniks continued through the war. Chetniks with Italian backing controlled most of the country from mid-1942 to April 1943. Montenegrin Chetniks received the status of \"anti-communist militia\" and received weapons, ammunition, food rations, and money from Italy. Most of them were moved to [[Mostar]], where they fought in the [[Battle of Neretva]] against the Partisans, but were dealt a heavy defeat.\n\nDuring the German operation Schwartz against the Partisans in May and June 1943, Germans disarmed large number of Chetniks without fighting, as they feared they would turn against them in case of an Allied invasion of the Balkans. After the capitulation of Italy in September 1943, Partisans managed to take hold of most of Montenegro for a brief time, but Montenegro was soon [[German occupied territory of Montenegro|occupied by German forces]], and fierce fighting continued during late 1943 and entire 1944. Montenegro was liberated by the Partisans in December 1944.\n[[File:Odlazak predsednika Tita iz vile \"Gorica\".jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Josip Broz Tito]] was the leader of [[SFR Yugoslavia]] from 1944 to 1980; Pictured: Tito in [[Podgorica]]]]\n\n=== Montenegro within Socialist Yugoslavia ===\n{{Main|Socialist Republic of Montenegro}}\n\nMontenegro, like the rest of Yugoslavia, was liberated by the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] in 1944.\n\nMontenegro became one of the six constituent republics of the communist [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). Its capital became Podgorica, renamed [[Titograd]] in honour of President [[Josip Broz Tito]].

The opponents claimed that the poll was organized under anti-[[Democracy|democratic conditions]] with widespread propaganda from the state-controlled media in favour of a pro-federation vote.

At the secondary level there are a number of art schools, apprentice schools and teacher training schools. Those who have attended the technical schools may pursue their education further at one of two-year post-secondary schools, created in response to the needs of industry and the social services.\n\nSecondary schools are divided in three types, and children attend one depending on choice and primary school grades:\n\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (Gimnazija / \u0413\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438j\u0430), lasts for four years and offers a general, broad education. It is a preparatory school for university, and hence the most academic and prestigious.\n* Professional schools (Stru\u010dna \u0161kola / \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0443\u0447\u043d\u0430 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430) last for three or four years and specialize students in certain fields which may result in their attending college; professional schools offer a relatively broad education.\n* Vocational schools (Zanatska \u0161kola / \u0417\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0448\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430) last for three years and focus on vocational education (e.g., joinery, plumbing, mechanics) without an option of continuing education after three years.\n[[File:Cetinje, Montenegro - panoramio (15).jpg|thumb|[[National Library of Montenegro]] in [[Cetinje]]]]\n\n=== Tertiary education ===\nTertiary level institutions are divided into \"Higher education\" (Vi\u0161e obrazovanje) and \"High education\" (Visoko obrazovanje) level faculties.\n\n* Colleges (Fakultet) and art academies (akademija umjetnosti) last between 4 and 6 years (one year is two semesters long) and award diplomas equivalent to a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree.\n\nHigher schools (Vi\u0161a \u0161kola) lasts between two and four years.\n\n=== Post-graduate education ===\nPost-graduate education (post-diplomske studije) is offered after tertiary level and offers [[Masters' degree]]s, PhD and specialization education.\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Montenegro}}\n[[File:THEOTOKOS PHILERMON.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Our Lady of Philermos]] the patroness of Montenegro, [[Rhodes]] and [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], one of the first Christian icons, according to legend painted by [[Luke the Evangelist|St. Luke]], [[National Museum of Montenegro]], Cetinje.]]\n\n=== Art ===\n[[File:Vladin Dom (Dom Rz\u0105dowy) w Cetinje 02.jpg|thumb|[[National Museum of Montenegro]]]]\n[[File:Museo_Mar\u00edtimo,_Kotor,_Bah\u00eda_de_Kotor,_Montenegro,_2014-04-19,_DD_31.JPG|thumb|right|Maritime Museum of Montenegro in [[Kotor]].]]\n\nThe culture of Montenegro has been shaped by a variety of influences throughout history.

The Montenegrin coastal region is especially well known for its religious monuments, including the [[Cathedral of Saint Tryphon]] in [[Kotor]]<ref>{{cite web |first=Aleksandar |last=\u0160estovi\u0107 |url=http://www.kotoronline.com |title=Kotor |publisher=Kotoronline.com |accessdate=11 September 2010}}</ref> (Cattaro under the Venetians), the basilica of St. Luke (over 800 years), [[Our Lady of the Rocks]] (\u0160krpjela), the [[Savina monastery (Montenegro)|Savina Monastery]] and others.

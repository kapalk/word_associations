The official language of the country, [[Estonian language|Estonian]], is the second most spoken [[Finnic languages|Finnic language]].\n\nThe territory of Estonia has been inhabited since at least 9,000 B.C. [[Ancient Estonia]]ns were some of the last European pagans to be [[Christianity|Christianized]], following the [[Livonian Crusade]] in the [[13th century]]. After centuries of successive rule by [[Teutonic Order|Germans]], [[Duchy of Estonia (1219\u20131346)|Danes]], [[Estonia under Swedish rule|Swedes]], [[Duchy of Livonia|Poles]] and [[Russian Estonia|Russians]], a distinct [[Estonian national awakening|Estonian national identity]] began to emerge in the [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th centuries]]. This culminated in [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|independence from Russia]] in 1920 after a brief [[Estonian War of Independence|War of Independence]] at the end of [[World War I]]. Initially democratic, after the [[Great Depression]] Estonia was governed by authoritarian rule since 1934 during the [[Era of Silence]]. During [[World War II]] (1939&ndash;1945), Estonia was [[Occupation of the Baltic states|repeatedly contested and occupied]] by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], ultimately being incorporated into the former as the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. After the loss of its ''de facto'' independence, Estonia's [[State continuity of the Baltic states|''de jure'' state continuity]] was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the [[Estonian government-in-exile|government-in-exile]]. In 1987 the peaceful [[Singing Revolution]] began against Soviet rule, resulting in the restoration of ''de facto'' independence on [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|20 August 1991]].\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Estonia is a democratic [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] divided into fifteen [[Counties of Estonia|counties]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Tallinn]]. With a population of 1.3&nbsp;million, it is one of the least-populous member states of the [[European Union]] since joining in 2004, the economic monetary [[Eurozone]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[Schengen Area]], and of the Western military alliance of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO).

The political culture is stable in Estonia, where power is held between two and three parties that have been in politics for a long time. This situation is similar to other countries in Northern Europe. The former Prime Minister of Estonia, [[Andrus Ansip]], is also the European Union's longest-serving Prime Minister (from 2005 until 2014).

The Estonian political system operates under a framework laid out in the 1992 [[Constitution|constitutional document]]. The Estonian parliament has 101 members and influences the governing of the state primarily by determining the income and the expenses of the state (establishing taxes and adopting the budget). At the same time the parliament has the right to present statements, declarations and appeals to the people of Estonia, ratify and denounce international treaties with other states and international organisations and decide on the Government loans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riigikogu.ee/?id=34632|title=Functions|accessdate=27 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Riigikogu elects and appoints several high officials of the state, including the President of the Republic. In addition to that, the Riigikogu appoints, on the proposal of the [[President of Estonia]], the Chairman of the National Court, the chairman of the board of the Bank of Estonia, the Auditor General, the Legal Chancellor and the Commander-in-Chief of the [[Estonian Defence Forces|Defence Forces]]. A member of the Riigikogu has the right to demand explanations from the Government of the Republic and its members. This enables the members of the parliament to observe the activities of the executive power and the above-mentioned high officials of the state.\n\n===Government===\n{{Main|Government of Estonia|Prime Minister of Estonia|President of Estonia}}\n\nThe Government of Estonia ({{lang-et|Vabariigi Valitsus}}) or the [[executive branch]] is formed by the [[Prime Minister of Estonia]], nominated by the president and approved by the parliament. The government exercises executive power pursuant to the [[Constitution of Estonia]] and the laws of the Republic of Estonia and consists of twelve ministers, including the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister also has the right to appoint other ministers and assign them a subject to deal with. These are ''ministers without portfolio'' \u2013 they don't have a ministry to control.\n[[File:Stenbock House.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Stenbock House grey stucco three-story building with pediment and portico and red hip roof|[[Stenbock House]], the seat of the Government of Estonia on [[Toompea]] Hill]]\n\nThe Prime Minister has the right to appoint a maximum of three such ministers, as the limit of ministers in one government is fifteen. It is also known as the cabinet. The cabinet carries out the country's domestic and foreign policy, shaped by parliament; it directs and co-ordinates the work of government institutions and bears full responsibility for everything occurring within the authority of executive power. The government, headed by the Prime Minister, thus represents the political leadership of the country and makes decisions in the name of the whole executive power.\n\nEstonia has pursued the development of the e-state and [[e-government]].

The first documented reference to Estonian political and administrative subdivisions comes from the [[Chronicle of Henry of Livonia]], written in the thirteenth century during the [[Northern Crusades]].<ref>[[History of Estonia]] History of Estonia</ref>\n\nA ''[[county|maakond]]'' (county) is the biggest administrative subdivision. Several changes were made to the borders of counties after Estonia became independent, most notably the formation of [[Valga County]] (from parts of [[V\u00f5ru County|V\u00f5ru]], [[Tartu County|Tartu]] and [[Viljandi County|Viljandi]] counties) and [[Petseri County]] (area acquired from Russia with the 1920 [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Tartu Peace Treaty]]). During the [[Estonian SSR|Soviet rule]], Petseri County was annexed and ceded to the [[Russian SFSR]] in 1945 where it became [[Pechorsky District]] of [[Pskov Oblast]]. Counties were again re-established on 1 January 1990 in the borders of the Soviet-era [[raion|districts]]. Because of the numerous differences between the current and historical (pre-1940, and sometimes pre-1918) layouts, the historical borders are still used in ethnology, representing cultural and linguistic differences better. Now defunct, the county government ''(Maavalitsus)'' of each county used to be led by a county governor ''(Maavanem)'', who represented the national government at the regional level. Governors were appointed by the [[Government of Estonia]] for a term of five years.\n\nEach county is further divided into municipalities (''omavalitsus''), which is also the smallest administrative subdivision of Estonia. There are two types of municipalities: an urban municipality&nbsp;\u2013 ''linn'' (town), and a [[rural municipality]]&nbsp;\u2013 ''vald'' (parish). There is no other status distinction between them. Each municipality is a unit of [[self-government]] with its [[Representation (politics)|representative]] and executive bodies. The municipalities in Estonia cover the entire territory of the country.\n\nA municipality may contain one or more populated places. [[Tallinn]] is divided into eight districts (''linnaosa'') with limited self-government ([[Haabersti]], [[Kesklinn, Tallinn|Kesklinn]] (centre), [[Kristiine]], [[Lasnam\u00e4e]], [[Mustam\u00e4e]], [[N\u00f5mme]], [[Pirita]] and [[P\u00f5hja-Tallinn]]). Rural municipalities may also be divided into (rural) districts (''osavald''), most prominent being [[Hiiumaa Parish]] with its five, fairly autonomous districts.\n\nMunicipalities range in size of population from Tallinn with around 450,000 inhabitants to [[Ruhnu]] with as few as around 150. They also range fairly in area from Saaremaa Parish (2717,83&nbsp;km\u00b2) to [[Loksa]] town (3,82&nbsp;km\u00b2). {{as of|2017|October}}, after the [[Administrative reform of Estonia]], there are a total of 79 municipalities in Estonia, 14 of them being urban and 65 rural.

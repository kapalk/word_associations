The country geographically comprises two main landmasses\u2014the [[North Island]] (''Te Ika-a-M\u0101ui''), and the [[South Island]] (''Te Waipounamu'')\u2014and around 600 [[List of islands of New Zealand|smaller islands]]. New Zealand is situated some {{convert|2000|km|-2}} east of [[Australia]] across the [[Tasman Sea]] and roughly {{convert|1000|km|-2}} south of the [[List of islands in the Pacific Ocean|Pacific island areas]] of [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]], and [[Tonga]]. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|biodiversity]] of animal, fungal, and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the [[Southern Alps]], owe much to the [[tectonic uplift]] of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's [[Capital of New Zealand|capital city]] is [[Wellington]], while its most populous city is [[Auckland]].\n\nSometime between 1250 and 1300, [[Polynesians]] settled in the islands that later were named New Zealand and developed a distinctive [[M\u0101ori culture]]. In 1642, Dutch explorer [[Abel Tasman]] became the first European to sight New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chiefs signed the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841, New Zealand [[Colony of New Zealand|became a colony]] within the [[British Empire]] and in 1907 it [[Dominion of New Zealand|became a dominion]]; it gained [[Independence of New Zealand|full statutory independence]] in 1947 and the British monarch remained the [[head of state]]. Today, the majority of [[New Zealand's population]] of 4.9&nbsp;million is of [[European New Zealanders|European descent]]; the indigenous M\u0101ori are the largest minority, followed by [[Asian New Zealanders|Asians]] and [[Pacific Islander]]s. Reflecting this, [[New Zealand's culture]] is mainly derived from M\u0101ori and early British settlers, with recent broadening arising from increased [[Immigration to New Zealand|immigration]]. The [[Languages of New Zealand|official languages]] are [[English language|English]], [[M\u0101ori language|M\u0101ori]], and [[NZ Sign Language]], with English being very dominant.\n\nA [[developed country]], New Zealand [[international rankings of New Zealand|ranks highly]] in international comparisons of national performance, such as quality of life, health, education, protection of [[civil liberties]], and [[economic freedom]]. New Zealand underwent [[Rogernomics|major economic changes]] during the 1980s, which transformed it from a [[protectionist]] to a [[economic liberalization|liberalised]] [[free-trade]] economy. The service sector dominates the [[Economy of New Zealand|national economy]], followed by the industrial sector, and [[Agriculture in New Zealand|agriculture]]; international [[tourism in New Zealand|tourism]] is a significant source of revenue. Nationally, legislative authority is vested in an elected, [[unicameral]] [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], while executive political power is exercised by the [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]], led by the [[Prime Minister of New Zealand|prime minister]], currently [[Jacinda Ardern]]. [[Queen Elizabeth II]] is the [[monarchy of New Zealand|country's monarch]] and is represented by a [[Governor-General of New Zealand|governor-general]], currently [[Dame Patsy Reddy]]. In addition, New Zealand is organised into 11 [[Regions of New Zealand|regional councils]] and 67 [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]] for local government purposes. The [[Realm of New Zealand]] also includes [[Tokelau]] (a [[dependent territory]]); the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] (self-governing states in [[Associated state|free association]] with New Zealand); and the [[Ross Dependency]], which is New Zealand's [[territorial claim in Antarctica]]. New Zealand is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[ANZUS]], [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus Six]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]], the [[Pacific Community]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{See also|New Zealand place names}}\n\n[[File:Detail of 1657 map Polus Antarcticus by Jan Janssonius, showing Nova Zeelandia.png|thumb|left|Detail from a 1657 map showing the western coastline of \"Nova Zeelandia\".

Initial analysis of the discovery concluded that the eastern province of Saudi Arabia was the homeland of the earliest settlers of Mesopotamia, and by extension, the likely origin of the Sumerians. However, experts such as Joan Oates had the opportunity to see the Ubaid period sherds in eastern Arabia and consequently conclude that the sherds dates to the last two phases of Ubaid period (period three and four), while handful examples could be classified roughly as either Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 2. Thus the idea that colonists from Saudi Arabia had emigrated to southern Mesopotamia and founded the region's first sedentary culture was abandoned.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 175.</ref>\n\nClimatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 176.</ref> The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from Uruk refer to a place called [[Dilmun]], associated in several occasions with copper and in later period it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/> Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggests that, in the early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966 an earthworks in Tarout exposed ancient burial field that yielded a large impressive statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\nBy 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of [[Bahrain]], and a major developed settlements appeared in Bahrain for the first time, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds that dates to this period were discovered.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n[[File:Figures Five Kings of Midian Slain by Israel.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Five kings of Midian slain by Israel (illustration from the 1728 ''Figures de la Bible'')]]\nBy the Late Bronze Age, a historically recorded people and land (Median and the Medianites) in the north-western portion of Saudi Arabia are well-documented in the Bible.

The first was the [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]]. It was feared that the country's [[Shi'a Islam in Saudi Arabia|Shi'ite minority]] in the [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]] (which is also the location of the oil fields) might rebel under the influence of their Iranian co-religionists.

It led to rapid technological (but not cultural) modernisation, urbanization, mass public education and the creation of new media. This and the presence of increasingly large numbers of foreign workers greatly affected traditional Saudi norms and values. Although there was dramatic change in the social and economic life of the country, political power continued to be monopolized by the royal family<ref name=\"Britannica history\"/> leading to discontent among many Saudis who began to look for wider participation in government.<ref>[[#Abir1993|Abir (1993)]], p. 114</ref>\n\nIn the 1980s, Saudi Arabia spent $25 billion in support of [[Saddam Hussein]] in the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref>Robert Fisk (2005) ''[[The Great War For Civilisation]]''.

Although now extremely wealthy, Saudi Arabia's economy was near stagnant. High taxes and a growth in unemployment have contributed to discontent, and has been reflected in a rise in civil unrest, and discontent with the royal family. In response, a number of limited \"reforms\" were initiated by King Fahd. In March 1992, he introduced the \"[[Basic Law of Saudi Arabia|Basic Law]]\", which emphasised the duties and responsibilities of a ruler. In December 1993, the Consultative Council was inaugurated.

Al-Hasa has over 30 million palm trees which produce over 100 thousand tons of dates every year.]]\n\nSerious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s. The government launched an extensive program to promote modern farming technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training institutions.\nAs a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is now completely self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs, including meat, milk and eggs.\nThe country exports wheat, dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables and flowers to markets around the world. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid.\nIn addition, Saudi farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources, domestic production of wheat has ended.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia ends domestic wheat production program|url = https://www.world-grain.com/articles/6275-saudi-arabia-ends-domestic-wheat-production-program|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom likewise has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of 1,800 gallons per cow, one of the highest in the world. The local dairy manufacturing company [[Almarai]] is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|title=Innovation Drive Al-Marai|publisher=Elopak|accessdate=3 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113093305/http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|archivedate=13 November 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom's most dramatic agricultural accomplishment, noted worldwide, was its rapid transformation from importer to exporter of wheat. In 1978, the country built its first grain silos. By 1984, it had become self-sufficient in wheat. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia began exporting wheat to some thirty countries, including China and the former Soviet Union, and in the major producing areas of Tabuk, Hail and Qasim, average yields reached 3.6 tons per acre.\nThe Kingdom has, however, stepped up fruit and vegetable production, by improving both agricultural techniques and the roads that link farmers with urban consumers. Saudi Arabia is a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to its neighbors. Among its most productive crops are watermelon, grapes, citrus fruits, onions, squash and tomatoes. At Jizan in the country's well-watered southwest, the Al-Hikmah Research Station is producing tropical fruits including pineapples, paw-paws, bananas, mangoes and guavas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agriculture & Water|url = https://www.saudiembassy.net/agriculture-water |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[olive]] tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia.

About 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and 10% from surface water, especially in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital [[Riyadh]], located in the heart of the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the [[Persian Gulf]] over a distance of 467&nbsp;km. Given the substantial [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|oil wealth]], water is provided almost for free. Despite improvements service quality remains poor. For example, in Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days.<ref name=\"GWI April 2011\">Global Water Intelligence: Becoming a world-class water utility, April 2011</ref> Institutional capacity and [[governance]] in the sector are weak, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Since 2000, the government has increasingly relied on the private sector to operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants.

The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's [[desert]] climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by an [[agal]]) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an [[agal]]) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black [[abaya]] or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect for their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.\n* [[Ghutrah]] ({{lang-ar|\u063a\u062a\u0631\u0647}}) is a traditional [[headdress]] typically worn by [[Arab]] men. It is made of a square of cloth (\"scarf\"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an [[arid]] climate, to provide protection from direct [[sun exposure]], and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and [[sand]].\n* [[Agal]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0644}}) is an item of [[Arab]] headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the [[Ghutrah]] to hold it in place. The ''agal'' is usually black in colour.\n* [[Thawb]] ({{lang-ar|\u062b\u0648\u0628}}) is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle-length, usually with long sleeves, similar to a [[robe]].\n* [[Bisht (clothing)|Bisht]] ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0634\u062a}}) is a traditional Arabic men's [[cloak]] usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings.\n* [[Abaya]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0629}}) is a women's garment. It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head. Some women choose to cover their faces with a niq\u0101b and some do not. Some abayas cover the top of the head as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |title=Traditional dress of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |date=29 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115808/http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Arts and entertainment===\n{{Main|Saudi Arabian art|Cinema of Saudi Arabia|Music of Saudi Arabia|Theatre in Saudi Arabia}}\n[[File:King Abdullah in his youth.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King Abdullah practising [[falconry]], a traditional pursuit in the country]]\n\nDuring the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom although they were seen as contrary to Wahhabi norms.<ref name=\"Return of cinema in Saudi Arabia provokes critics\">[http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/01/05/return-of-cinema-in-saudi-arabia-provokes-critics/3473/ World Focus]. 5 January 2009</ref> During the [[Islamic revival]] movement in the 1980s, and as a political response to an increase in [[Islamist]] activism including the 1979 [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca]], the government closed all cinemas and theaters.

Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the \u02bfar\u1e0dah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines.

In April 1920 the [[British Mandate for Mesopotamia (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] was created under the authority of the [[League of Nations]]. A British-backed monarchy joining these ''vilayets'' into one Kingdom was established in 1921 under [[Faisal I of Iraq]]. The [[Kingdom of Iraq|Hashemite Kingdom of Iraq]] gained independence from the UK in 1932. In 1958, [[14 July Revolution|the monarchy was overthrown]] and the [[Iraqi Republic (1958\u201368)|Iraqi Republic]] created.

[[Sargon of Akkad]], originally a [[Rabshakeh]] to a Sumerian king, founded the empire, he conquered all of the city states of southern and central Iraq, and subjugated the kings of Assyria, thus uniting the Sumerians and Akkadians in one state. He then set about expanding his empire, conquering [[Gutium]], [[Elam]] and had victories that did not result into a full conquest against the [[Amorites]] and [[Ebla]]ites of [[Ancient Syria]].\n\nAfter the collapse of the Akkadian Empire in the late 22nd century BC, the [[Gutians]] occupied the south for a few decades, while Assyria reasserted its independence in the north. This was followed by a Sumerian renaissance in the form of the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The Sumerians under king [[Shulgi]] conquered almost all of Iraq except the northern reaches of Assyria, and asserted themselves over the [[Gutians]], [[Elamites]] and [[Amorites]], destroying the first and holding off the others.\n\nAn [[Elam]]ite invasion in 2004 BC brought the Sumerian revival to an end. By the mid 21st century BC, the Akkadian speaking kingdom of [[Assyria]] had risen to dominance in northern Iraq. Assyria expanded territorially into the north eastern Levant, central Iraq, and eastern Anatolia, forming the [[Old Assyrian Empire]] (circa 2035\u20131750 BC) under kings such as [[Puzur-Ashur I]], [[Sargon I]], [[Ilushuma]] and [[Erishum I]], the latter of whom produced the most detailed set of law yet written.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} The south broke up into a number of Akkadian speaking states, [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Eshnunna]] being the major ones.\n\nDuring the 20th century BC, the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] speaking [[Amorites]] began to migrate into southern Mesopotamia. Eventually, they began to set up small petty kingdoms in the south, as well as usurping the thrones of extant city states such as [[Isin]], [[Larsa]] and [[Eshnunna]].\n\n[[File:F0182 Louvre Code Hammourabi Bas-relief Sb8 rwk.jpg|thumb|[[Hammurabi]], depicted as receiving his royal insignia from [[Shamash]].

It remained insignificant for over a century, overshadowed by older and more powerful states, such as Assyria, Elam, Isin, Ehnunna and Larsa.\n\nIn 1792 BC, an [[Amorite]] ruler named [[Hammurabi]] came to power in this state, and immediately set about building Babylon from a minor town into a major city, declaring himself its king. Hammurabi conquered the whole of southern and central Iraq, as well as Elam to the east and Mari to the west, then engaged in a protracted war with the Assyrian king [[Ishme-Dagan]] for domination of the region, creating the short-lived [[Babylonian Empire]]. He eventually prevailed over the successor of Ishme-Dagan and subjected Assyria and its Anatolian colonies. By the middle of the eighteenth century BC, the Sumerians had lost their cultural identity and ceased to exist as a distinct people.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wolkstein|first1=Diane|last2=Kramer|first2=Samuel Noah|title=Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth: Her Stories and Hymns from Sumer|year=1983|publisher=Harper&Row Publishers|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0-06-090854-6|pages=118\u2013119|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kramer|first1=Samuel Noah|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-226-45238-8|pages=71\u201372|ref=harv}}</ref> Genetic and cultural analysis indicates that the [[Marsh Arabs]] of southern Iraq are probably their most direct modern descendants.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=N|first1=Al-Zahery|last2=M|first2=Pala|last3=V|first3=Battaglia |last4=V|first4=Grugni|last5=MA|first5=Hamod|last6=B|first6=Hooshiar Kashani|last7=A|first7=Olivieri|last8=A|first8=Torroni|last9=AS|first9=Santachiara-Benerecetti|last10=O|first10=Semino|date=4 October 2011|title=In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: a survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq.|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|volume=11|pages=288|pmid=21970613|pmc=3215667|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-288|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Ghareeb|first1=Edmund|last2=Dougherty|first2=Beth|date=2004|title=Historical Dictionary of Iraq|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Historical_Dictionary_of_Iraq.html?id=RIB5qT9sGnwC |series=Historical Dictionaries of Asia, Oceania, and the Middle East|volume=44|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810865686|page=156|ref=harv}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Kubba|first1=Sam|title=The Iraqi Marshlands and the Marsh Arabs: The Ma'dan, Their Culture and the Environment|date=2011|publisher=Itahca Press|location=Reading, England|isbn=978-0-86372-333-9|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GoiR2Jy57LwC&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6#v=onepage&q=Marsh%20Arabs%20Sumerians|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nIt is from the period of Hammurabi that southern Iraq came to be known as [[Babylonia]], while the north had already coalesced into [[Assyria]] hundreds of years before. However, his empire was short-lived, and rapidly collapsed after his death, with both Assyria and southern Iraq, in the form of the [[Sealand Dynasty]], falling back into native Akkadian hands. The foreign Amorites clung on to power in a once more weak and small Babylonia until it was sacked by the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] speaking [[Hittite Empire]] based in [[Anatolia]] in 1595 BC. After this, another foreign people, the [[Language Isolate]] speaking [[Kassites]], originating in the [[Zagros Mountains]] of [[Ancient Iran]], seized control of Babylonia, where they were to rule for almost 600 years, by far the longest dynasty ever to rule in Babylon.\n\nIraq was from this point divided into three polities: [[Assyria]] in the north, [[Kassite]] [[Babylonia]] in the south central region, and the [[Sealand Dynasty]] in the far south. The Sealand Dynasty was finally conquered by Kassite Babylonia circa 1380 BC.\n\nThe [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131020 BC) saw Assyria rise to be the most powerful nation in the known world. Beginning with the campaigns of [[Ashur-uballit I]], Assyria destroyed the rival [[Hurrian]]-[[Mitanni]] Empire, annexed huge swathes of the [[Hittite Empire]] for itself, annexed northern Babylonia from the Kassites, forced the [[Egyptian Empire]] from the region, and defeated the [[Elamites]], [[Phrygians]], [[Canaanites]], [[Phoenicians]], [[Cilicians]], [[Gutians]], [[Dilmun]]ites and [[Arameans]]. At its height, the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] stretched from [[The Caucasus]] to [[Dilmun]] (modern [[Bahrain]]), and from the [[Mediterranean]] coasts of [[Phoenicia]] to the [[Zagros Mountains]] of [[Iran]]. In 1235 BC, [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] of Assyria took the throne of [[Babylon]], thus becoming the very first ''native Mesopotamian'' to rule the state.\n\n[[File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Jehu]], king of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]], bows before Shalmaneser III of [[Assyria]], 825 BC.]]\nDuring the [[Bronze Age collapse]] (1200\u2013900 BC), Babylonia was in a state of chaos, dominated for long periods by Assyria and [[Elam]]. The Kassites were driven from power by Assyria and Elam, allowing native south Mesopotamian kings to rule Babylonia for the first time, although often subject to Assyrian or Elamite rulers. However, these [[East Semitic languages|East Semitic]] Akkadian kings, were unable to prevent new waves of [[West Semitic languages|West Semitic]] migrants entering southern Iraq, and during the 11th century BC [[Arameans]] and [[Suteans]] entered Babylonia from [[The Levant]], and these were followed in the late 10th to early 9th century BC by the migrant [[Chaldea]]ns who were closely related to the earlier [[Arameans]].\n\n==== Iron Age ====\nAfter a period of comparative decline in Assyria, it once more began to expand with the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (935\u2013605 BC). This was to be the largest empire the region had yet seen, and under rulers such as [[Adad-Nirari II]], [[Ashurnasirpal I|Ashurnasirpal]], [[Shalmaneser III]], [[Semiramis]], [[Tiglath-pileser III]], [[Sargon II]], [[Sennacherib]], [[Esarhaddon]] and [[Ashurbanipal]], Iraq became the centre of an empire stretching from [[Persia]], [[Parthia]] and [[Elam]] in the east, to [[Cyprus]] and [[Antioch]] in the west, and from [[The Caucasus]] in the north to [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]] and [[Arabia]] in the south.\n\nThe [[Arab people|Arabs]] and the [[Chaldea]]ns are first mentioned in written history (circa 850 BC) in the annals of [[Shalmaneser III]].\n\nIt was during this period that an Akkadian influenced form of [[Eastern Aramaic]] was adopted by the Assyrians as the [[lingua franca]] of their vast empire, and Mesopotamian Aramaic began to supplant Akkadian as the spoken language of the general populace of both Assyria and Babylonia. The descendant dialects of this tongue survive amongst the [[Mandaeans]] of southern Iraq and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of northern Iraq to this day.\n\n[[File:Loewenjagd -645-635 Niniveh.JPG|thumb|Relief showing a [[Lion hunting|lion hunt]], from the north palace of [[Nineveh]], 645\u2013635 BC.]]\nIn the late 7th century BC, the Assyrian Empire tore itself apart with a series of brutal civil wars, weakening itself to such a degree that a coalition of its former subjects; the [[Babylonians]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Medes]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Scythians]] and [[Cimmerians]], were able to attack Assyria, finally bringing its empire down by 605 BC.<ref>Georges Roux \u2013 Ancient Iraq</ref>\n\n==== Babylonian and Persian periods ====\nThe short-lived [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (620\u2013539 BC) succeeded that of Assyria. It failed to attain the size, power or longevity of its predecessor; however, it came to dominate [[The Levant]], [[Canaan]], [[Arabia]], [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], and to defeat [[Egypt]]. Initially, Babylon was ruled by yet another foreign dynasty, that of the [[Chaldea]]ns, who had migrated to the region in the late 10th or early 9th century BC. Its greatest king, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], rivalled another non native ruler, the ethnically unrelated [[Amorite]] king [[Hammurabi]], as the greatest king of Babylon. However, by 556 BC, the Chaldeans had been deposed from power by the Assyrian born [[Nabonidus]] and his son and regent [[Belshazzar]].\n\nIn the 6th century BC, [[Cyrus the Great]] of neighbouring [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] defeated the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] at the [[Battle of Opis]] and Iraq was subsumed into the [[Achaemenid Empire]] for nearly two centuries. The Achaemenids made [[Babylon]] their main capital. The Chaldeans and Chaldea disappeared at around this time, though both Assyria and Babylonia endured and thrived under Achaemenid rule (see [[Achaemenid Assyria]]). Little changed under the Persians, having spent three centuries under Assyrian rule, their kings saw themselves as successors to Ashurbanipal, and they retained Assyrian Imperial Aramaic as the language of empire, together with the Assyrian imperial infrastructure, and an Assyrian style of art and architecture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\n[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|The Greek-ruled [[Seleucid Empire]] (in yellow) with capital in [[Seleucia]] on the Tigris, north of Babylon.]]\nIn the late 4th century BC, [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the region, putting it under [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] rule for over two centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lsa.umich.edu/kelsey/research/past-field-projects/seleucia-tigris-iraq-1927-32-1936-37.html |title=Seleucia on the Tigris |publisher=Umich.edu |date=1927-12-29 |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> The Seleucids introduced the [[Indo-Anatolian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''Syria'' to the region.

From [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]], the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] invaded western parts of the region [[Roman-Parthian Wars|several times]], briefly founding ''Assyria Provincia'' in Assyria. [[Christianity]] began to take hold in Iraq (particularly in [[Assyria]]) between the 1st and 3rd centuries, and Assyria became a centre of [[Syriac Christianity]], the [[Church of the East]] and [[Syriac literature]]. A number of independent states evolved in the north during the Parthian era, such as [[Adiabene]], [[Assur]], [[Osroene]] and [[Hatra]].\n\nThe [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanids]] of Persia under [[Ardashir I]] destroyed the Parthian Empire and conquered the region in 224 AD. During the 240s and 250's AD, the Sassanids gradually conquered the independent states, culminating with Assur in 256 AD. The region was thus a province of the [[Sassanid Empire]] for over four centuries, and became the frontier and battle ground between the Sassanid Empire and [[Byzantine Empire]], with both empires weakening each other, paving the way for the [[Arab]]-[[Muslim conquest of Persia]] in the mid-7th century.\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Abbasid Caliphate]] at its greatest extent, c. 850.]]\nThe Arab Islamic conquest in the mid-7th century AD established [[Islam]] in Iraq and saw a large influx of [[Arabs]].

In Iraq, one of the goals was for education to be universally available for both boys and girls at the primary level. UNICEF collected several pieces of data that indicate whether or not, Iraq has been accomplishing this goal.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn general, the education of Iraq has been improving since the MDGs were implemented.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, enrollment numbers nearly doubled from 2000 to 2012.<ref name=\":1\" /> It went from 3.6 million to six million.<ref name=\":1\" /> The latest statistic from 2015-2016 showed that almost 9.2 million children were in school.<ref name=\":1\" /> Enrollment rates continue to be on a steady increase at about 4.1% each year.<ref name=\":1\" /> The sheer increase in numbers shows that there are clearly improvements of children in Iraq having access to education.\n\nHowever, the dramatic increase of the number of students in primary education has had some negative and straining effects for the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> The budget for education makes up about only 5.7% of government spending and continues to stay at or below this percentage.<ref name=\":1\" /> Investments for schools has also been on the decline.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, the country now ranks at the bottom of Middle East countries in terms of education.<ref name=\":1\" /> The little funding for education makes it more difficult to improve the quality and resources for education.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nAt the same time, UNICEF investigated portions of spending for education and found that some of the money has gone to waste.<ref name=\":1\" /> They found that dropout rates are increasing as well as repetition rates for children.<ref name=\":1\" /> In both Iraq Centre and KRI, the rates for dropouts are about 1.5% to 2.5%.<ref name=\":1\" /> Within these dropout rates, there is also an uneven number among boys and girls who dropout.<ref name=\":1\" /> While the rate for dropouts for boys was around 16.5%, girls were at 20.1% where it could be due to economic or family reasons.<ref name=\":1\" /> For repetition rates, percentages have almost reached 17% among all students.<ref name=\":1\" /> To put the money loss in perspective, about $1,100 is spent on each student.<ref name=\":1\" /> For each student who drops out or repeats a grade, $1,100 is lost.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result, almost 20% of the funding for education was lost to dropouts and repetition for the year 2014-2015.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nMany of those people who dropout or have to repeat a grade do not see the economic cost for long term results.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF takes note of how staying in school can in fact, increase wealth for the person and their family.<ref name=\":1\" /> While it may put a strain on the education system, it will also hinder the chances of a person receiving higher earnings in whatever career they go into.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nOther statistics show that regional differences can attribute to lower or higher enrollment rates for children in primary education.<ref name=\":1\" /> For example, UNICEF found that areas with conflict like Salah al-Din have \u201cmore than 90% of school-age children\u201d not in the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> In addition, some schools were converted into refugee shelters or military bases in 2014 as conflict began to increase.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite

name=\":3\" /> Depending on where children live, they may or may not have the same access to education as other children.\n\nThere are also the differing enrollment rates between boys and girls.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF found that in 2013-2014, enrollment numbers for boys was at about five million while girls were at about 4.2 million.<ref name=\":1\" /> While the out-of-school rate for girls is at about 11%, boys are at less than half of that.<ref name=\":1\" /> There is still a gap between boys and girls in terms of educational opportunities.<ref name=\":1\" /> However, the rate of enrollments for girls has been increasing at a higher rate than for boys.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 2015-2016, the enrollment numbers for girls increased by 400,000 from the previous year where a large number of them were located in Iraq Centre.<ref name=\":1\" /> Not only that, UNICEF found that the increase of girls going to school was across all levels of education.<ref name=\":1\" /> Therefore, the unequal enrollment numbers between boys and girls could potentially change so that universal education can be achieved by all at equal rates.\n\nAlthough the numbers suggest a dramatic increase of enrollment rates for primary education in total, a large number of children still remain out of the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> Many of these children fall under the category of internally displaced children due to the conflict in Syria and the takeover by ISIL.<ref name=\":1\" /> This causes a disruption for children who are attempting to go to school and holds them back from completing their education, no matter what level they are at.<ref name=\":1\" /> Internally displaced children are specifically recorded to track children who have been forced to move within their country due to these types of conflicts. About 355,000 of internally displaced children are not in the education system.<ref name=\":1\" /> 330,000 of those children live in Iraq Centre.<ref name=\":1\" /> The rates among internally displaced children continue to remain higher in Iraq Centre than other areas such as the KRI.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the overall increase of enrollment rates, there continues to be a large strain on the resources for education.<ref name=\":1\" /> UNICEF notes that without an increase on expenditures for education, the quality of education will continue to decrease.<ref name=\":1\" /> Early in the 2000s, the UNESCO International Bureau of Education found that the education system in Iraq had issues with standard-built school buildings, having enough teachers, implementing a standardized curricula, textbooks and technologies that are needed to help reach its educational goals.<ref name=\":02\" /> Teachers are important resources that are starting to become more and more strained with the rising number of students.<ref name=\":1\" /> Iraq Centre has a faster enrollment growth rate than teacher growth.<ref name=\":1\" /> Teachers begin to have to take in more and more students which can produce a bigger strain on the teacher and quality of education the children receive.<ref name=\":1\" /> Another large resource for education is libraries that can increase literacy and create a reading culture.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Ian|date=2016|title=International Assistance and National and Individual Contributions in the Development of Education for Library,

Stages are: pre-invasion preparation, and the war and the actual choice of targets, the first post-war period, and a growing insurgency and hand over power to the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) and Prime Minister [[Iyad Allawi]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Al-Marashi|first=Ibrahim|title=Toward an Understanding of Media Policy and Media Systems in Iraq|year=2007|series=Center for Global Communications Studies, Occasional Paper Series|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1058&context=asc_papers|accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref>{{page needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Iraqi cuisine}}\n[[File:Masgouf.jpg|thumb|[[Masgouf]], a popular Iraqi dish.]]\nIraqi cuisine can be traced back some 10,000 years \u2013 to the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], [[Babylonia]]ns, [[Assyria]]ns and [[Achaemenid Empire|Ancient Persians]].<ref name=\"Salloum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/3592 |title=Foods of Iraq: Enshrined With A Long History |publisher=ThingsAsian |accessdate=2011-06-19}}</ref> [[Clay tablet|Tablets]] found in ancient ruins in Iraq show recipes prepared in the temples during religious festivals \u2013 the first cookbooks in the world.<ref name=\"Salloum\" /> [[Ancient Iraq]], or ''[[Mesopotamia]]'', was home to many sophisticated and highly advanced civilisations, in all fields of knowledge \u2013 including the culinary arts.<ref name=\"Salloum\" /> However, it was in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval era]] when Baghdad was the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] that the Iraqi kitchen reached its zenith.<ref name=\"Salloum\" /> Today the cuisine of Iraq reflects this rich inheritance as well as strong influences from the culinary traditions of neighbouring [[Turkey]], [[Iran]] and the [[Greater Syria]] area.<ref name=\"Salloum\" />\n\nSome characteristic ingredients of Iraqi cuisine include \u2013 vegetables such as [[aubergine]], [[tomato]], [[okra]], [[onion]], [[potato]], [[courgette]], [[garlic]], [[Bell pepper|peppers]] and [[chili pepper|chilli]], cereals such as [[rice]], [[bulgur]] [[wheat]] and [[barley]], pulses and legumes such as [[lentils]], [[chickpeas]] and [[Cannellini#White beans|cannellini]], fruits such as [[Date Palm#Dates|dates]], [[raisin]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[Common fig|figs]], [[grape]]s, [[melon]], [[pomegranate]] and [[citrus|citrus fruits]], especially [[lemon]] and [[lime (fruit)|lime]].<ref name=\"Salloum\" />\n\nSimilarly with other countries of [[Western Asia]], chicken and especially lamb are the favourite meats.

Football is a considerable uniting factor in Iraq following years of war and unrest. [[Basketball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[bodybuilding]], [[boxing]], [[kick boxing]] and [[tennis]] are also popular sports.\n\nThe [[Iraqi Football Association]] is the governing body of football in Iraq, controlling the [[Iraq national football team|Iraqi National Team]] and the [[Iraqi Premier League]] (also known as [[Dawri Al-Nokba]]). It was founded in 1948, and has been a member of [[FIFA]] since 1950 and the [[Asian Football Confederation]] since 1971. The biggest club in Iraq is [[Al-Shorta SC|Al-Shorta]], who won back-to-back league titles in 2013 and 2014 and were the first ever winners of the [[Arab Champions League]]. The Iraqi National Football Team were the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]] champions after defeating [[Saudi Arabia]] in the final by 1\u20130 thanks to a goal by captain [[Younis Mahmoud]] and they have participated in two [[FIFA]] competitions (the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]]).\n\n==Technology==\n\n===Mobile phones===\nDespite having mobile phones in the Middle East since 1995, Iraqis were only able to use mobile phones after 2003.

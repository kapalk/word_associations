Egypt is a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean country]] bordered by the [[Gaza Strip]] and [[Israel]] to the northeast, the [[Gulf of Aqaba]] and the [[Red Sea]] to the east, [[Sudan]] to the south, and [[Libya]] to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies [[Jordan]], across the Red Sea lies [[Saudi Arabia]], and across the Mediterranean lie [[Greece]], [[Turkey]] and [[Cyprus]], although none share a land border with Egypt.\n\nEgypt has one of the longest histories of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 6th\u20134th millennia BCE. Considered a [[cradle of civilisation]], [[Ancient Egypt]] saw some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Prehistory of Egypt: From the First Egyptians to the First Kings|last=Midant-Reynes|first=B\u00e9atrix|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|year=|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Iconic monuments such as the [[Giza Necropolis]] and its [[Great Sphinx of Giza|Great Sphinx]], as well the ruins of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], [[Karnak]], and the [[Valley of the Kings]], reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of scientific and popular interest. Egypt's long and rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, which has endured, and often assimilated, various foreign influences, including [[Greeks|Greek]], [[Persians|Persian]], [[Romans|Roman]], [[Arab]], [[Ottomans|Ottoman Turkish]], and [[Nubian people|Nubian]]. Egypt was an early and important [[Christianity in Egypt|centre of Christianity]], but was largely [[Islamisation|Islamised]] in the seventh century and remains a predominantly [[Muslim]] country, albeit with a [[Copts in Egypt|significant Christian minority]].\n\nFrom the 16th to the beginning of the 20th century, Egypt was ruled by foreign imperial powers: [[The Ottoman Empire]] and the [[British Empire]]. Modern Egypt dates back to 1922, when it gained nominal independence from the [[British Empire]] as a monarchy. However, [[British military]] occupation of Egypt continued, and many Egyptians believed that the monarchy was an instrument of British colonialism. Following the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]], Egypt expelled British soldiers and bureaucrats and ended British occupation, nationalized the British-held Suez Canal, exiled [[King Farouk]] and his family, and declared itself a [[Republic of Egypt (1953\u201358)|republic]]. In 1958 it merged with [[Syrian Republic (1946\u201363)|Syria]] to form the [[United Arab Republic]], which dissolved in 1961. Throughout the second half of the 20th century, Egypt endured social and religious strife and political instability, fighting [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict|several armed conflicts]] with [[Israel]] in [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|1948]], [[Suez Crisis|1956]], [[Six-Day War|1967]] and [[Yom Kippur War|1973]], and [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupying]] the [[Gaza Strip]] intermittently until 1967. In 1978, Egypt signed the [[Camp David Accords]], officially withdrawing from the Gaza Strip and [[Egypt\u2013Israel Peace Treaty|recognising Israel]]. The country continues to face challenges, from political unrest, including the recent [[Egyptian revolution of 2011|2011 revolution]] and [[Egyptian crisis (2011\u201314)|its aftermath]], to terrorism and economic underdevelopment. Egypt's current government is a [[presidential republic]] headed by President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]], which has been described by a number of watchdogs as authoritarian.\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] of Egypt and [[Arabic]] is its official language.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constitution of The Arab Republic of Egypt 2014|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/Newvr/Dustor-en001.pdf|website=sis.gov.eg|accessdate=13 April 2017}}</ref> With over 95 million inhabitants, Egypt is the most populous country in [[North Africa]], the [[Middle East]], and the [[Arab world]], the third-most populous in Africa (after [[Nigeria]] and [[Ethiopia]]), and the fifteenth-most populous in the world.

However, the application of the (possibly) \"dual\" ending to some toponyms and other words, a development peculiar to Hebrew, does not in fact imply any \"two-ness\" about the place. The ending is found, for example, in the Hebrew words for such single entities as \"water\" (\"\u05de\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd\"), \"noon\" (\"\u05e6\u05b8\u05d4\u05b3\u05e8\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd\"), \"sky/heaven\" (\"\u05e9\u05b8\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u05d9\u05b4\u05dd\"), and in the ''[[Qere and Ketiv|qere]]'' \u2013 but not the original \"ketiv\" \u2013 of \"Jerusalem\" (\"\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05e9\u05dc[\u05d9]\u05dd\").

The union was short-lived, ending in 1961 when [[Syria]] seceded, thus ending the union. During most of its existence, the United Arab Republic was also in a loose [[confederation]] with [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen|North Yemen]] (or the Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen), known as the [[United Arab States]]. In 1959, the [[All-Palestine Government]] of the Gaza Strip, an Egyptian client state, was absorbed into the [[United Arab Republic]] under the pretext of Arab union, and was never restored.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Egypt became fully involved in the [[North Yemen Civil War]]. The Egyptian President, Gamal Abdel Nasser, supported the Yemeni republicans with as many as 70,000 Egyptian troops and chemical weapons. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egyptian commitment in Yemen was greatly undermined later.\n\nIn mid May 1967, the Soviet Union issued warnings to [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] of an impending Israeli attack on Syria.

In 1973, Egypt, along with Syria, launched the [[Yom Kippur War|October War]], a surprise attack to regain part of the Sinai territory Israel had captured 6 years earlier.

Winds create prolific [[Dune|sand dunes]] that peak at more than {{convert|100|ft|0}} high. Egypt includes parts of the [[Sahara]] desert and of the [[Libyan Desert]]. These deserts protected the Kingdom of the Pharaohs from western threats and were referred to as the \"red land\" in ancient Egypt.\n\nTowns and cities include [[Alexandria]], the second largest city; [[Aswan]]; [[Asyut]]; [[Cairo]], the modern Egyptian capital and largest city; [[El Mahalla El Kubra]]; [[Giza]], the site of the Pyramid of Khufu; [[Hurghada]]; [[Luxor]]; [[Kom Ombo]]; [[Port Safaga]]; [[Port Said]]; [[Sharm El Sheikh]]; [[Suez]], where the south end of the Suez Canal is located; [[Zagazig]]; and [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]].

Average high temperatures are high in the north but very to extremely high in the rest of the country during summer. The cooler Mediterranean winds consistently blow over the northern sea coast, which helps to get more moderated temperatures, especially at the height of the summertime. The [[Khamaseen]] is a hot, dry wind that originates from the vast deserts in the south and blows in the spring or in the early summer. It brings scorching sand and dust particles, and usually brings daytime temperatures over {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} and sometimes over {{convert|50|\u00b0C}} in the interior, while the relative humidity can drop to 5% or even less. The absolute highest temperatures in Egypt occur when the Khamaseen blows. The weather is always sunny and clear in Egypt, especially in cities such as [[Aswan]], [[Luxor]] and [[Asyut]]. It is one of the least cloudy and least rainy regions on Earth.\n\nPrior to the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]], the Nile flooded annually (colloquially ''The Gift of the Nile'') replenishing Egypt's soil. This gave Egypt a consistent harvest throughout the years.\n\nThe potential rise in sea levels due to [[global warming]] could threaten Egypt's densely populated coastal strip and have grave consequences for the country's economy, agriculture and industry. Combined with growing demographic pressures, a significant rise in sea levels could turn millions of Egyptians into [[environmental refugees]] by the end of the 21st century, according to some climate experts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/Report.aspx?ReportId=77240 |title=Contingency planning for rising sea levels in Egypt &#124; IRIN News, March 2008 |publisher=Irinnews.org |accessdate=25 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=El Deeb and Keath|first=Sarah and Lee|title=Islamist claims victory in Egypt president vote|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_EGYPT?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2012-06-17-23-11-03|work=Associated Press|accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Biodiversity===\n{{main|Wildlife of Egypt}}\nEgypt signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 9 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 2 June 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |accessdate=8 December 2012}}</ref> It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity Action Plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], which was received by the convention on 31 July 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/eg/eg-nbsap-01-en.pdf |title=Egypt: National Strategy and Action Plan for Biodiversity Conservation |accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref> Where many [[Center for Biological Diversity|CBD]] [[Biodiversity Action Plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans]] neglect biological kingdoms apart from animals and plants,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm |title=The Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation |accessdate=9 December 2012}}</ref> Egypt's plan was unusual in providing balanced information about all forms of life.\n\nThe plan stated that the following numbers of species of different groups had been recorded from Egypt: algae (1483 species), animals (about 15,000 species of which more than 10,000 were insects), fungi (more than 627 species), monera (319 species), plants (2426 species), protozoans (371 species). For some major groups, for example lichen-forming fungi and nematode worms, the number was not known. Apart from small and well-studied groups like amphibians, birds, fish, mammals and reptiles, the many of those numbers are likely to increase as further species are recorded from Egypt.

The uprising was initially against unemployment, economic conditions, and corruption, as well as against the government's proposals to modify the [[constitution of Yemen]] so that Saleh's son could inherit the presidency.\n\nIn March 2011, police snipers opened fire on the pro-democracy camp in Sana'a, killing more than 50 people. In May, dozens were killed in clashes between troops and tribal fighters in Sana'a. By this point, Saleh began to lose international support. In October 2011, Yemeni human rights activist [[Tawakul Karman]] won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], and the [[UN Security Council]] condemned the violence and called for a transfer of power. On 23 November 2011, Saleh flew to Riyadh, in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, to sign the [[Gulf Co-operation Council]] plan for political transition, which he had previously spurned.

The [[Tihamah|Tih\u0101mah]] (\"hot lands\" or \"hot earth\") form a very arid and flat coastal plain along Yemen's entire Red Sea coastline. Despite the aridity, the presence of many lagoons makes this region very marshy and a suitable breeding ground for [[malaria]] [[mosquito]]s. Extensive crescent-shaped sand dunes are present. The evaporation in the Tihamah is so great that streams from the highlands never reach the sea, but they do contribute to extensive [[groundwater]] reserves. Today, these are heavily exploited for agricultural use. Near the village of [[Madar, Yemen|Madar]] about {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} north of Sana'a, [[dinosaur]] footprints were found, indicating that the area was once a muddy flat.\n\nThe Tihamah ends abruptly at the [[escarpment]] of the western highlands. This area, now heavily [[terrace (agriculture)|terraced]] to meet the demand for food, receives the highest rainfall in Arabia, rapidly increasing from {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} per year to about {{convert|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Taiz and over {{convert|1000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in Ibb.\n\nTemperatures are hot in the day, but fall dramatically at night. Perennial streams occur in the highlands, but these never reach the sea because of high evaporation in the Tihamah.\n\nThe central highlands are an extensive high plateau over {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in elevation. This area is drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Water storage allows for [[irrigation]] and the growing of [[wheat]] and [[barley]]. Sana'a is in this region. The highest point in Yemen and Arabia is [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]], at about {{convert|3666|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Burrows2010\"/><ref name=\"Laughlin2008\">{{cite book |last=McLaughlin |first=Daniel |title=Yemen |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |chapter=1: Background |page=3 |isbn=978-1-8416-2212-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC&pg |year=2008}}</ref>\n\nYemen's portion of the Rub al Khali desert in the east is much lower, generally below {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, and receives almost no rain. It is populated only by [[Bedouin]] herders of [[dromedary|camels]]. The growing scarcity of water is a source of increasing international concern.

The Sudanian element\u2014characterized by relatively high rainfall\u2014dominates the western mountains and parts of the highland plains. The Saharo-Arabian element dominates in the coastal plains, eastern mountain, and the eastern and northern desert plains. A high percentage of Yemen plants belong to tropical African plants of Sudanian regions. Among the Sudanian element species, the following may be mentioned: ''[[Ficus]]'' spp., ''[[Acacia mellifera]], [[Grewia villosa]], [[Commiphora]]'' spp., ''[[Rose|Rosa]] abyssinica'', ''[[Cadaba]] farinosa'' and others.<ref>Abdul Wali A. al-Khulaidi, ''Flora of Yemen'', Sustainable Environmental Management Program (YEM/97/100), Republic of Yemen, June 2000, p. 7</ref>\n\nAmong the Saharo-Arabian species, these may be mentioned: ''[[Panicum turgidum]], [[Aerva javanica]], [[Zygophyllum]] simplex, [[Fagonia]] indica, [[Salsola]]'' spp., ''[[Acacia tortilis]], A. hamulos, [[Acacia ehrenbergiana|A. ehrenbergiana]], [[Phoenix dactylifera]], [[Hyphaene thebaica]], [[Capparis decidua]], [[Salvadora persica]], [[Balanites aegyptiaca]]'', and many others.

The [[President of Yemen|President]] is the [[head of state]], and the [[Prime Minister of Yemen|Prime Minister]] is the [[head of government]]. In Sana'a, a [[Supreme Political Council]] (not recognized internationally) forms the government.\n\nThe 1991 constitution provides that the president be elected by popular vote from at least two candidates endorsed by at least 15 members of the Parliament. The prime minister, in turn, is appointed by the president and must be approved by two-thirds of the Parliament. The presidential term of office is seven years, and the parliamentary term of elected office is six years.

The country's relations with Saudi Arabia were defined by the [[Taif Agreement]] of 1934, which delineated the northernmost part of the border between the two kingdoms and set the framework for commercial and other intercourse. The Taif Agreement has been renewed periodically in 20-year increments, and its validity was reaffirmed in 1995. Relations with the British colonial authorities in Aden and the south were usually tense.\n\nThe Soviet and Chinese Aid Missions established in 1958 and 1959 were the first important non-Muslim presences in North Yemen. Following the September 1962 revolution, the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] became closely allied with and heavily dependent upon Egypt.

Phase one of the program included major financial and monetary reforms, including floating the currency, reducing the budget deficit, and cutting subsidies. Phase two addresses structural issues, such as civil service reform.\n\nIn early 1995, the government of Yemen launched an economic, financial, and administrative reform program (EFARP) with the support of the World Bank and the IMF, as well as international donors.

There have been Yemeni productions of plays by Arab authors such as [[Tawfiq al-Hakim]] and [[Saadallah Wannous]] and by Western authors, including [[Shakespeare]], [[Pirandello]], [[Brecht]], and [[Tennessee Williams]].

Socotra island is home to some of the best surfing destinations in the world.\n\n[[Camel jumping]] is a traditional sport that is becoming increasingly popular among the Zaraniq tribe on the west coast of Yemen in a desert plain by the [[Red Sea]].

The site has a rich biodiversity. Nowhere else in the world do 37% of Socotra's 825 plants, 90% of its reptiles and 95% of its snails occur. It is home to 192 bird species, 253 species of coral, 730 species of coastal fish, and 300 species of crab and lobster, as well as a range of ''[[Aloe]]s'' and the Dragon's Blood Tree (''[[Dracaena cinnabari]]''). The cultural heritage of Socotra includes the unique [[Soqotri language]].\n\n==Education==\n{{main|Education in Yemen}}\n[[File:Sana'a New University.JPG|thumb|New Sana'a University in Sana'a]]\n\nThe adult literacy rate in 2010 was 64%.<ref name=unescolit>{{cite web|title=National adult literacy rates (15+), youth literacy rates (15\u201324) and elderly literacy rates (65+)|url=http://stats.uis.unesco.org/unesco/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=210|publisher=UNESCO Institute for Statistics|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> The government has committed to reduce illiteracy to less than 10% by 2025.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibe.unesco.org/National_Reports/ICE_2008/yemen_NR08.pdf|title=Republic of Yemen, Ministry of Education Report 2008. \"The Development of Education in the Republic of Yemen.\"|page=3|year=2008|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> Although Yemen's government provides for universal, compulsory, free education for children ages six through 15, the U.S. Department of State reports that compulsory attendance is not enforced.

During the mid-2000s Yemen decided to take a market-based approach to their healthcare system due to increased liberalization within the country.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite web|url=https://login.csulb.idm.oclc.org/login?qurl=https%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3da9h%26AN%3d119434140%26site%3dehost-live|title=EZ Proxy {{!}} California State University, Long Beach|website=login.csulb.idm.oclc.org|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> However, this market based approach directly affected the poor and those living in rural areas, because of a decrease in Yemen's budget in public healthcare  and use of user fees.<ref name=\":02\" /> Access to healthcare services is highly determined by geographic location. Although Yemen's constitution promises healthcare for all, only 25% of those living in rural areas have access to healthcare services compared to the 80% that have access to healthcare services in urban areas.<ref name=\":02\" /> In addition, most hospitals are in urban areas which makes accessibility difficult for those living in rural areas. Yemen's public healthcare system is compiled of four levels: (1) 2929 primary health care units (2) 184 district hospitals (3) 53 general hospitals (4) two specialist referral hospitals. However. many of these facilities lack resources and employees due to the small budget spent on public healthcare in Yemen.<ref name=\":02\" /> However, in 2002 Yemen created the District Healthcare System (DHS) in order to deliver primary health care through community-based services, which in the end failed due to poor management. On the other hand, Yemen's private sector has succeeded, there were 167 private hospitals in 2002 and by 2012 there were 746 private hospitals.<ref name=\":02\" /> Yemen's healthcare system prior to the current conflict was weak, however, still better than currently.\n\n=== During the crisis ===\nCurrently, only 45% of healthcare facilities in Yemen are functioning and accessible to the public, while, 247 of healthcare facilities have been destroyed and damaged by the ongoing conflict.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2017/02/552032-yemens-health-system-another-victim-conflict-un-health-agency|title=Yemen's health system another victim of the conflict \u2013 UN health agency|date=2017-02-23|website=UN News|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> In addition, healthcare facilities that are still functioning lack the resources and employees to provide the appropriate healthcare service because humanitarian aide is restricted by the constant fighting, airstrikes, bombardments, and lack of ceasefire. It is dangerous for humanitarian workers to step foot on the ground because they could be easily killed due to the constant fighting by both parties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/entity/bulletin/volumes/93/10/15-021015/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Health system in Yemen close to collapse|website=WHO|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> Many hospitals and clinics have had shortages in vaccines, medical equipment, and basic drugs due to the ongoing conflict.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/dying-babies-and-no-doctors-a-look-inside-a-yemeni-hospital/2018/08/05/8bcf87d4-8f7e-11e8-b769-e3fff17f0689_story.html?noredirect=on|title=Dying babies and no doctors: A look inside a Yemeni hospital|last=Raghavan|first=Sudarsan|date=|website=The Washington Post|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref> Therefore, while healthcare facilities are working they lack the equipment and employees to provide all of those in need with help. In 2017, the UN reported that healthcare facilities had not been given sufficient funds and that healthcare workers were working without salaries since September 2016.<ref name=\":1\" /> As a result healthcare workers are quitting and facilities are losing staff in a time of need. At the same time, many patients are not able to afford the hospital service fees, even though they are cheap. Due to the high demand of healthcare services, local volunteers and medical students have been trained to respond to basic needs during emergencies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/03/yemen-healthcare-system-confronts-mounting-burden-160311111849065.html|title=Yemen's healthcare system confronts mounting burden {{!}} News {{!}} Al Jazeera|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref> It is estimated that 14.8 million people in Yemen currently lack healthcare and that 22 million people  are in need of humanitarian assistance.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== During conflict ===\nSince the beginning of the conflict, the people of Yemen have become more susceptible to diseases and long-lasting health problems.

Yemen has made significant progress since 1950; as of 2015, the child mortality rate has dropped to 44.52 children per 1000 infants born. With the ongoing epidemic of Cholera ravaging Yemen, the death toll of children rises. As of 2018, more than 20 million Yemeni people are in need of humanitarian assistance, 9 million being children. Currently every 10 minutes, a child dies from preventable causes.\n\nMalnutrition is one of the leading causes of child mortality. As of 2018, about 2 million Yemeni children suffer from acute malnutrition due to the civil war consuming their nation's economy. Geographically, Yemen also consists of the worlds most depleted water sources. According to UNICEF, nearly 462,000 children are reported suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition leading As of November 21, 2018, an estimated 85,000 children have died under the age of five due to acute malnutrition throughout the three-year-long war.<ref>https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46261983</ref> This number does not include children missing, displaced, or currently medically unstable.\n\nAbuse and the exploitation of children in Yemen has become common practice as the civil war carries on between the Houthi rebels and Yemeni Government Forces. There are a reported 6,500 children that have been killed or injured from violence as the country's infrastructure collapses. Children are constantly being recruited for war measures and being killed in the crossfire. There have been a reported upwards of 800 children being recruited for the civil war.\n\n===Disease===\nCholera has broken out within Yemen because of its poor infrastructure. Yemen faces issues in control and provisions of fresh, clean water as Yemen does not have the capacity to create the infrastructure needed to provide it; thus, forcing people to obtain unsanitary water from rivers, lakes, and wells. Cholera is prominently found in contaminated drinking water, making the Yemeni people, especially children, the most prone to such a disease. Reports have been made that there've been more than 815,000 suspected cases of Cholera in Yemen over the past three years, 60% percent of them being children.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/oct/12/yemen-cholera-outbreak-worst-in-history-1-million-cases-by-end-of-year</ref> Cholera can be found throughout a majority of Yemen, mostly concentrated in the cities closest to water. Cholera currently kills an estimated 95,000 people per year and infects upwards of 2.9 million people.<ref>http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/276289/A71_6-en.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y&ua=1</ref>\n\nDiphtheria has spread throughout Yemen.  Upwards of 1,300 people have been infected as of March 2018, 80% of cases being children. As of February 21, 2018, there have been 66 reported deaths from Diphtheria.\n\n===Foreign assistance===\nUNICEF has made a huge effort in fighting the war against the Cholera Epidemic with major efforts of providing vaccines help immunize the Yemeni people. There have been 900,000 of suspected Cholera cases and can be treated. They've launched various campaigns to help combat sicknesses such as whooping cough, pneumonia, tetanus, tuberculosis, diphtheria, and meningitis and continue to send vaccines to the Yemeni people.<ref>https://knoema.com/atlas/Yemen/topics/Demographics/Mortality/Infant-mortality-rate</ref><ref>https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/cholera-crisis-yemen-unicefs-race-save-children/32576</ref><ref>https://www.unicefusa.org/stories/yemen-one-worst-places-earth-be-child/33675</ref> As of December 4, 2018, the United States has funded approximately US$696 million in Humanitarian funding for Yemen. Humanitarian Organizations have created huge impacts in Yemen by providing  Health, Nutrition, and Food provisions for the impacted. The KSA and United Arab Emirates (UAE) have also supported food and nutritional support by pledging US$500 million to help provide for 12 million Yemeni people.\n\nThe World Health Organization has provided substantial aid to Yemen and continues its efforts in creating a sustainable health system. In 2016, the World Health Organization created functional health facilities including 414 operating sites within 145 districts including of over 400 mobile health and nutrition teams in another 266 districts throughout Yemen. They've also provided extensive child health nutrition interventions in over 300 districts and have established 26 Cholera Treatment centers. They are the leading effort in polio immunization treating over 4.5 million children under the age of 5. They've supplied 565 tons of essential vaccines and medical supplies expected to help upwards of 3 million people in conflict impacted areas.\n\nThe World Health Organization has provided huge efforts by creating its Humanitarian response plan in 2017. Their plan consisted of a US$219.2 million WHO budget and a US$430.4 million Health Sector budget that targeted support for 2.6 million women and 5.8 million children in Yemen.<ref>https://www.who.int/emergencies/response-plans/2017/yemen/en/</ref> They created four specific objectives in providing aid: Provide health services, response and supervision, and medical supplies to districts; Strengthen health sector efficiency and health information systems; Increase reproductive, maternal, newborn, and adolescent health interventions, including violence against women; Bolster community-based health initiatives and create self-sustaining infrastructure for the health system. They have allocated budgets primarily towards Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and Cholera projects.\n\n===Current standing===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}\nCurrently, Yemen still stands divided as a nation engulfed in political turmoil and disease. Infrastructure is still yet to be set by the government, resulting in suffering for the people across the nation. Significant progress has been made in Yemen however, there are still major problems at hand. The infant mortality rate is still 44.52 per 1000 children. The Cholera Epidemic still grows strong as the government has failed to sustain clean water filtration systems and infrastructure. Diphtheria is growing into a major issue infecting hundreds of people and in certain cases resulting in death. Although vaccines are being sent to Yemen, a majority of the population has yet to get immunizations because of the lack of access or lack of knowledge. The Yemeni Civil War still envelopes Yemen in violence between the Yemeni government and the Houthi militia whilst using the city streets as their battlegrounds, resulting in the displacement of millions of people from their homes.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Yemen}}\n{{portal|Yemen|Middle East}}\n* [[List of Yemen-related topics]]\n* [[Outline of Yemen]]{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n<!-- This article uses [[Wikipedia:Footnotes]].

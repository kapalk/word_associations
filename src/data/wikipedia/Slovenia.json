The etymology of {{wikt-lang|en|Slav}} itself remains uncertain.\n\nThe reconstructed autonym ''{{lang|sla|*Slov\u011bnin\u044a}}'' is usually derived from the word ''slovo'' (\"[[word]]\"), originally denoting \"people who speak (the same language),\" i.&nbsp;e. people who understand each other. This is in contrast to the Slavic word denoting German people, namely {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044cc\u044c}}, meaning \"silent, mute people\" (from Slavic {{wikt-lang|sla-pro|*n\u011bm\u044a}} \"[[muteness|mute]], mumbling\"). The word ''slovo'' (\"word\") and the related ''slava'' (\"glory, fame\") and ''slukh'' (\"hearing\") originate from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root {{wikt-lang|ine-pro|*\u1e31lew-}} (\"be spoken of, glory\"), cognate with Ancient Greek {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} ({{grc-tr|\u03ba\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c2}} \"fame\"), as in the name [[Pericles]], Latin {{wikt-lang|la|clueo}} (\"be called\"), and English {{wikt-lang|en|loud}}.\n\nThe modern Slovene state originates from the [[Slovene National Liberation Committee]] (SNOS) held on 19 February 1944. They officially named the state as ''Federal Slovenia'' ({{lang|sl|Federalna Slovenija}}), a unit within the Yugoslav federation. On 20 February 1946, Federal Slovenia was renamed the ''People's Republic of Slovenia'' (''Ljudska republika Slovenija'').<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-AFGPZB0W/? |title=Mesto kot upravnoteritorialna enota 1945\u20131955 |language=Slovenian, English|trans-title=A Town as an Administrative\u2013Territorial Unit |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |year=2007 |volume=30 |issue=2 |publisher=Arhivsko dru\u0161tvo Slovenije |id={{COBISS|ID=914293}} |page=83 |journal=Arhivi |issn=0351-2835}}</ref> It retained this name until 9 April 1963, when its name was changed again, this time to ''Socialist Republic of Slovenia'' ({{lang-sl|Socialisti\u010dna republika Slovenija}}).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://sistory.si/publikacije/prenos/?urn=SISTORY:ID:9842 |title=Ustava Socialisti\u010dne republike Slovenije z dne 9. aprila 1963 |language=Slovenian|trans-title=The Constitution of the Socialist Republic of Slovenia from 9 April 1963 |first=Janez |last=Kopa\u010d |journal=Arhivi |year=2001 |volume=XXIV |issue=1 |page=1}}</ref> On 8 March 1990, SR Slovenia removed the prefix \"Socialist\" from its name, becoming the ''Republic of Slovenia''; it remained a part of the SFRY until 25 June 1991.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:center; clear:right;\"\n|+Official names\n! scope=\"col\" | Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1945\u20131946 || '''[[Slovene National Liberation Committee|Federal Slovenia]]''' || Part of the Democratic Federal Yugoslavia\n|-\n| 1946\u20131963 || '''People's Republic of Slovenia''' ||\n|-\n| 1963\u20131990 || '''Socialist Republic of Slovenia''' ||\n|-\n| 1990\u2013present || '''Republic of Slovenia''' ||\n|}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Slovenia}}\n\n=== Prehistory to Slavic settlement ===\n\n==== Prehistory ====\n[[File:Fl\u00fbte pal\u00e9olithique (mus\u00e9e national de Slov\u00e9nie, Ljubljana) (9420310527).jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Divje Babe flute|pierced cave bear bone]], possibly a [[flute]], from [[Divje Babe]]]]\nPresent-day Slovenia has been inhabited since [[prehistoric]] times.

The Romans established posts at [[Emona]] (Ljubljana), [[Poetovio]] (Ptuj), and [[Celeia]] (Celje); and constructed trade and military roads that ran across Slovene territory from Italy to Pannonia. In the 5th and 6th centuries, the area was subject to invasions by the [[Huns]] and Germanic tribes during their incursions into [[Italy]].

They were mostly Christianized by [[Irish people|Irish]] missionaries, among them [[Modestus (Apostle of Carantania)|Modestus]], known as the \"Apostle of Carantanians\". This process, together with the Christianization of the [[Bavarians]], was later described in the memorandum known as the [[Conversio Bagoariorum et Carantanorum]], which is thought to have overemphasized the role of the Church of Salzburg in the Christianization process over similar efforts of the Patriarchate of [[Aquileia]].\n\n[[File:Kaernten herzogeinsetzung.jpg|thumb|left|A depiction of an ancient democratic ritual of Slovene-speaking tribes, which took place on the [[Prince's Stone]] in the [[Slovene language]] until 1414.]]\n\nIn the mid-8th century, Carantania became a vassal duchy under the rule of the [[Bavaria]]ns, who began [[christianization|spreading Christianity]]. Three decades later, the [[Carantanians]] were incorporated, together with the Bavarians, into the [[Carolingian Empire]]. During the same period [[Carniola]], too, came under the Franks, and was Christianised from [[Aquileia]]. Following the anti-Frankish rebellion of [[Liudewit]] at the beginning of the 9th century, the [[Franks]] removed the Carantanian princes, replacing them with their own border dukes. Consequently, the Frankish [[feudal system]] reached the Slovene territory.\n\nAfter the victory of Emperor [[Otto I]] over the [[Magyars]] in 955, Slovene territory was divided into a number of border regions of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Carantania, being the most important, was elevated into the [[Duchy of Carinthia]] in 976.\n\nBy the 11th century, the Germanization of what is now [[Lower Austria]], effectively isolated the Slovene-inhabited territory from the other [[western Slavs]], speeding up the development of the [[Carantanians|Slavs of Carantania]] and of [[Carniola]] into an independent Carantanian/Carniolans/Slovene ethnic group. By the late Middle Ages, the historic provinces of Carniola, [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], [[County of Gorizia|Gorizia]], [[Trieste]], and [[Istria]] developed from the border regions and were incorporated into the medieval German state. The consolidation and formation of these historical lands took place in a long period between the 11th and 14th centuries, and were led by a number of important feudal families, such as the [[Bernhard von Spanheim|Dukes of Spannheim]], the [[Meinhardiner|Counts of Gorizia]], the [[Counts of Celje]], and, finally, the [[House of Habsburg]]. In a parallel process, an intensive German colonization significantly diminished the extent of Slovene-speaking areas. By the 15th century, the [[Slovene Lands|Slovene ethnic territory]] was reduced to its present size.<ref name=\"culture.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www.culture.si/en/Slovenia |title=About Slovenia \u2013 Culture of Slovenia |publisher=Culture.si |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the 14th century, most of the territory of present-day Slovenia was taken over by the [[Habsburgs]], the Hungarian clan [[Z\u00e1h (gens)|Z\u00e1h]] administering the territories connecting Slovenia with [[Slovakia]] and [[Moravia]] was exterminated in 1330 and the Slovenes permanently lost the connection with their [[Slovakia|Slovak]] kinsmen. The [[counts of Celje]], a feudal family from this area who in 1436 acquired the title of state princes, were [[Habsburgs]]' powerful competitors for some time. This large dynasty, important at a European political level, had its seat in Slovene territory but died out in 1456. Its numerous large estates subsequently became the property of the Habsburgs, who retained control of the area right up until the beginning of the 20th century.

They united the Slovene anti-Communist counter-insurgence into the [[Slovene Home Guard]] and appointed a puppet regime in the Province of Ljubljana.

A [[socialist state]] was established, but because of the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] in 1948, economic and personal freedoms were broader than in the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries. In 1947, the [[Slovene Littoral]] and the western half of [[Inner Carniola]], which had been annexed by [[Italy]] after World War One, were annexed to Slovenia.\n\nAfter the failure of [[Collective farming|forced collectivisation]] that was attempted from 1949\u201353, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as [[Workers' self-management|workers self-management]], was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader [[Edvard Kardelj]], the main ideologue of the [[Titoism|Titoist]] path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from within and outside the Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to [[Goli otok]].\n\n[[File:Nixontito19712.jpg|thumb|right|[[Josip Broz Tito]] led [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]] from 1944 to 1980; Pictured: Tito with the US president [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[White House]], 1971]]\nThe late 1950s saw a policy of liberalisation in the cultural sphere, as well, and limited border crossing into neighboring Italy and Austria was allowed again. Until the 1980s, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] enjoyed relatively broad autonomy within the federation. In 1956, [[Josip Broz Tito]], together with other leaders, founded the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Particularly in the 1950s, Slovenia's economy developed rapidly and was strongly industrialised. With further economic decentralisation of Yugoslavia in 1965\u201366, Slovenia's domestic product was 2.5 times the average of Yugoslav republics.\n\nOpposition to the regime was mostly limited to intellectual and literary circles, and became especially vocal after Tito's death in 1980, when the economic and political situation in Yugoslavia became very strained.<ref name=\"culture.si\"/> Political disputes around economic measures were echoed in the public sentiment, as many Slovenians felt they were being economically exploited, having to sustain an expensive and inefficient federal administration.\n\n=== Slovenian Spring, democracy and independence ===\nIn 1987 a group of intellectuals demanded Slovene independence in the [[Contributions for the Slovenian National Program|57th edition]] of the magazine ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]''.

Whereas the jugo is humid and warm, the bora is usually cold and gusty. The foehn is typical of the Alpine regions in the north of Slovenia.

During the first term of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s government, for the first time after independence, the Slovenian banks saw their [[loan-deposit ratio]]s veering out of control. There was over-borrowing from foreign banks and then over-crediting of customers, including local [[business magnates]].\n\nAfter the onset of the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132010]] and [[European sovereign-debt crisis]], the left-wing coalition that replaced Jan\u0161a's government in the 2008 elections, had to face the consequences of the 2005\u20132008 over-borrowing. Attempts to implement reforms that would help economic recovery were met by student protesters, led by a student who later became a member of [[Janez Jan\u0161a]]'s [[Slovenska demokratska stranka|SDS]], and by the trade unions. The proposed reforms were postponed in a referendum. The left-wing government was ousted with a vote of no confidence. Janez Jan\u0161a attributed the boom of spending and overborrowing to the period of left-wing government; he proposed harsh austerity reforms which he had previously helped postpone. Generally, some economists estimate that left and right parties attributed to over-loaning and managers' takeovers; reason behind was that each block tried to establish economic elite which will support political forces.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pavlov\u010di\u010d|first1=Idija|title=Jo\u017ee P.

The municipalities are the only bodies of local autonomy in Slovenia. Each municipality is headed by a mayor (''\u017eupan''), elected every four years by popular vote, and a municipal council (''ob\u010dinski svet''). In the majority of municipalities, the municipal council is elected through the system of [[proportional representation]]; only a few smaller municipalities use the [[plurality voting system]]. In the urban municipalities, the municipal councils are called town (or city) councils.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.gov.si/zak/Zak_vel.nsf/0/660b7ab7cbd45736c125662d0037c142?OpenDocument |title=Sprejet zakon |publisher=.gov.si |date=13 July 2000 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}</ref> Every municipality also has a Head of the Municipal Administration (''na\u010delnik ob\u010dinske uprave''), appointed by the mayor, who is responsible for the functioning of the local administration.<ref name=\"www2.gov.si\"/>\n\n==== Administrative districts ====\nThere is no official intermediate unit between the municipalities and the Republic of Slovenia. The 62 administrative districts, officially called \"Administrative Units\" (''upravne enote''), are only subdivisions of the national government administration and are named after their respective bases of government offices. They are headed by a Manager of the Unit (''na\u010delnik upravne enote''), appointed by the Minister of Public Administration.\n\n==== Traditional regions and identities ====\nTraditional regions were based on the former [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[crown land]]s that included [[Carniola]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], and the [[Slovene Littoral|Littoral]].

By the time of [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 16th century, music was used to proselytize. The first Slovenian hymnal, ''[[Eni Psalmi]]'', was published in 1567.

[[Ashgabat]] is the capital and largest city. The population of the country is 5.6 million, the lowest of the Central Asian republics and one of the most sparsely populated in Asia.\n\nTurkmenistan has been at the crossroads of civilizations for centuries. In medieval times, [[Merv]] was one of the great cities of the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] and an important stop on the [[Silk Road]], a caravan route used for trade with [[China]] until the mid-15th century. Annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1881, Turkmenistan later figured prominently in the [[Russian Civil War|anti-Bolshevik movement]] in Central Asia. In 1925, Turkmenistan became a constituent republic of the [[Soviet Union]], [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Turkmen SSR); it became independent upon the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.<ref name=cia />\n\nTurkmenistan possesses the world's sixth [[List of countries by natural gas proven reserves|largest reserves of natural gas resources]].<ref name=\"TM Gas Reserves\">{{cite web |url=https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/new-customer-turkmen-natural-gas |title= A New Customer for Turkmen Natural Gas| accessdate= 22 November 2017}}</ref> Most of the country is covered by the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum (Black Sand) Desert]].

He retained absolute control over the country after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. On 28 December 1999, Niyazov was declared President for Life of Turkmenistan by the Mejlis (parliament), which itself had taken office a week earlier in elections that included only candidates hand-picked by President Niyazov. No opposition candidates were allowed.\n\nSince the December 2006 death of Niyazov, Turkmenistan's leadership has made tentative moves to open up the country. His successor, President [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]], repealed some of Niyazov's most idiosyncratic policies, including banning opera and the circus for being ''\"insufficiently Turkmen\"''. In education, Berdimuhamedow's government increased basic education to ten years from nine years, and higher education was extended from four years to five. It also increased contacts with the West, which is eager for access to the country's natural gas riches.\n\nThe politics of Turkmenistan take place in the framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], with the [[President of Turkmenistan|President]] both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. Under Niyazov, Turkmenistan had a [[One-party state|one-party system]]; however, in September 2008, the People's Council unanimously passed a resolution adopting a new [[Constitution of Turkmenistan|Constitution]]. The latter resulted in the abolition of the Council and a significant increase in the size of Parliament in December 2008 and also permits the formation of multiple political parties.\n\nThe former Communist Party, now known as the [[Democratic Party of Turkmenistan]], is the dominant party. The second party, the [[Party of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs]] was established in August 2012. Political gatherings are illegal unless government sanctioned. In 2013 the first multi-party Parliamentary Elections [[Turkmenistani parliamentary election, 2013|were held]] in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan was a one-party state from 1991 to 2012; however, the 2013 elections were widely seen as mere window dressing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2014/turkmenistan|title=Turkmenistan|publisher=|accessdate=12 February 2016|date=8 September 2014}}</ref> In practice, all parties in parliament operate jointly under the direction of the DPT.

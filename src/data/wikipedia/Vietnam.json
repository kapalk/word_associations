An [[Ng\u00f4 dynasty|independent Vietnamese state]] emerged in 939 following Vietnamese victory in the [[Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (938)|battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng]] against the [[Southern Han]]. Successive [[List of Vietnamese monarchs|Vietnamese imperial dynasties]] flourished as the nation expanded geographically and politically into Southeast Asia, until the Indochina Peninsula was [[French Indochina|colonised by the French]] in the mid-19th century.\n\nFrench Indochina saw the [[Japanese invasion of French Indochina|Japanese occupation]] in 1940 amidst the escalation of [[World War II]]. Following Japanese defeat in 1945, the Vietnamese fought French rule in the [[First Indochina War]]. On 2 September 1945, Vietnamese revolutionary leader [[H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh]] declared Vietnam's independence from France and therefrom established a provisional communist state. After nine years of war, the Vietnamese declared victory in the decisive [[battle of \u0110i\u1ec7n Bi\u00ean Ph\u1ee7]] in 1954. The nation was thereafter divided into two rival states, communist [[North Vietnam|North]]\u2014the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and anti-communist [[South Vietnam|South]]\u2014the Republic of Vietnam. Conflicts intensified in the [[Vietnam War]] with [[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War|extensive US intervention]] in support of South Vietnam from 1965 to 1973. The war ended with [[fall of Saigon|North Vietnamese victory]] in 1975.\n\nNorth and South Vietnam were then reunified under a communist government in 1976. The newly established country remained impoverished and politically isolated until 1986, when the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]] initiated a series of [[\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi|economic and political reforms]] that facilitated Vietnamese integration into the world economy. By 2010, Vietnam had established [[Foreign relations of Vietnam|diplomatic relations]] with 178 countries. Since 2000, Vietnam's GDP growth rate has been among the [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|highest in the world]]. Its successful economic reforms resulted in its joining the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] in 2007.

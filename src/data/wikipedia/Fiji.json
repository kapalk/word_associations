They called their home Viti, but the Tongans called it Fisi, and it was by this foreign pronunciation, Fiji, first promulgated by Captain James Cook, that these islands are now known.<ref>[http://www.fijihighcommission.org.uk/about_1.html About Fiji], section on Europeans in Fiji.

Landing at what is now [[Vuda]], the settlers moved inland to the [[Nakauvadra]] mountains.  Though this oral tradition has not been independently substantiated, the Fijian government officially promotes it, and many tribes today claim to be descended from the children of Lutunasobasoba.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usp.ac.fj/index.php?id%3D6482 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201135049/http://www.usp.ac.fj/index.php?id=6482 |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} Dr Patrick D. Nunn</ref>\n\n[[Pottery]] art from Fijian towns shows that Fiji  was settled by [[Austronesian people]]s before or around 3500 to 1000&nbsp;BC, with [[Melanesia]]ns following around a thousand years later, although the question of Pacific migration still lingers. \nIt is believed that the [[Lapita people]] or the ancestors of the [[Polynesians]] settled the islands first but not much is known of what became of them after the [[Melanesians]] arrived; they may have had some influence on the new culture, and archaeological evidence shows that they would have then moved on to [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]] and even [[Hawai'i]].\n[[Archeology|Archeological]] evidence shows signs of settlement on [[Moturiki Island]] from 600 BC and possibly as far back as 900 BC.\nAspects of Fijian culture are similar to the Melanesian culture of the western [[pacific Ocean|Pacific]] but have a stronger connection to the older Polynesian cultures. Trade between Fiji and neighbouring archipelagos long before European contact is testified by the [[canoe]]s made from native Fijian trees found in Tonga and Tongan words being part of the language of the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] group of islands. Pots made in Fiji have been found in Samoa and even the [[Marquesas Islands]].\n\nIn the 10th century, the [[Tu'i Tonga Empire]] was established in [[Tonga]], and Fiji came within its sphere of influence. The Tongan influence brought [[Polynesia]]n customs and language into Fiji. The empire began to decline in the 13th century.\n\nAcross {{convert|1000|km}} from east to west, Fiji has been a nation of many languages. Fiji's history was one of settlement but also of mobility and over the centuries, a unique Fijian culture developed. Large elegant watercraft with rigged sails called ''[[drua]]'' were constructed in Fiji, some being exported to Tonga. Distinctive village architecture evolved consisting of communal and individual [[Bure (Fiji)|''bure'']] and ''vale'' housing with an advanced system of rampants and moats usually being constructed around the more important settlements. Pigs were domesticated for food and a variety of agricultural plantations such as bananas existed from an early stage. Villages would also be supplied with water brought in by constructed wooden aqueducts. Fijians lived in societies that were led by chiefs, elders and notable warriors. Spiritual leaders, often called ''bete'', were also important cultural figures and the production and consumption of [[kava|''yaqona'']] was part of their ceremonial and community rites. Fijians developed a monetary system where the polished teeth of the [[sperm whale]], called ''tambua'', became an active currency. A type of writing also existed which can be seen today in various petroglyphs around the islands.<ref>[[#Gravelle|Gravelle]]</ref> They also produced a refined [[Tapa cloth|''masi'' cloth]] textile industry with the material being used to make sails and clothes such as the ''malo'' and the ''liku''. As with most other human civilisations, warfare was an important part of everyday life in pre-colonial Fiji The Fijians were noted for their use of weapons especially  war-clubs.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fijian weapons & warfare|last=Fergus.|first=Clunie|date=2003|publisher=Fiji Museum|isbn=978-9822080063|oclc=55604396}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Adolph|title=The hill tribes of Fiji|date=1922|publisher=Seeley|location=London|url=https://archive.org/details/hilltribesoffiji00brew}}</ref> Fijians use many different types of clubs that can be broadly divided into two groups.

This was especially the case concerning traditional Fijian spiritual beliefs. Early colonists and missionaries utilised and conflated the concept of [[cannibalism]] in Fiji to give a moral imperative for colonial intrusion.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Thomas |title=The islands and their inhabitants. |date=1858 |publisher=A.

[[Bligh Water]], the strait between the two main islands, is named after him, and for a time, the Fiji Islands were known as the ''Bligh Islands.''\n[[File:FIJI CLUB DANCE.png|thumb|The first Europeans to land and live among the Fijians were shipwrecked sailors like [[Charles Savage (beachcomber)|Charles Savage]].]]\nThe first Europeans to maintain substantial contact with the Fijians were [[sandalwood]] merchants, whalers and [[sea cucumber|\"beche-de-mer\"]] (sea cucumber) traders. The first [[whaling]] vessel known to have visited was the Ann and Hope in 1799 and she was followed by many others in the 19th century.<ref>Robert Langdon (ed.)

Some of the Europeans who came to Fiji in this period were accepted by the locals and were allowed to stay as residents. Probably the most famous of these was a Swede by the name of Kalle Svenson, better known as [[Charles Savage (beachcomber)|Charlie Savage]]. Charlie was permitted to take wives and establish himself in a high rank in [[Bau (island)|Bau]] society in exchange for helping defeat local adversaries. In 1813, however, Charlie became a victim of this lifestyle and was killed in a botched raid.<ref>[[#Gravelle|Gravelle]], pp. 29\u201342</ref>\n\nBy the 1820s, [[Levuka]] was established as the first European-style town in Fiji, on the island of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau]].  The market for \"beche-de-mer\" in China was lucrative and British and American merchants set up processing stations on various islands. Local Fijians were utilised to collect, prepare and pack the product which would then be shipped to Asia. A good cargo would result in a half-yearly profit of around $25,000 for the dealer.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=Charles|title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition.

Some Fijian chiefs soon felt confident enough with their new weapons to forcibly obtain more destructive weaponry from the Europeans. In 1834, men from Viwa and Bau were able to take control of the French ship ''L'amiable Josephine'' and use its cannon against their enemies on the [[Rewa River]], although they later ran it aground.<ref>[[#Gravelle|Gravelle]], pp. 47\u201350</ref>\n\nChristian missionaries like David Cargill also arrived in the 1830s from recently converted regions such as [[Tonga]] and [[Tahiti]], and by 1840 the European settlement at Levuka had grown to about 40 houses with former whaler, [[David Whippey]], being a notable resident. The religious conversion of the Fijians was a gradual process which was observed first-hand by Captain [[Charles Wilkes]] of the United States Exploring Expedition. Wilkes wrote that \"all the chiefs seemed to look upon Christianity as a change in which they had much to lose and little to gain\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilkes|first1=Charles|title=Narrative of the United States Exploring Expedition Vol. 3|date=1849|page=155|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=gvAKAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> Christianised Fijians, in addition to forsaking their spiritual beliefs, were pressured into cutting their hair short, adopting the [[Sulu (skirt)|sulu]] form of dress from Tonga and fundamentally changing their marriage and funeral traditions.

Dufty.jpg|thumb|Ratu [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]], ''Tui Viti'']]\nThe 1840s was a time of conflict where various Fiji clans attempted to assert dominance over each other. Eventually, a warlord by the name of [[Seru Epenisa Cakobau]] of [[Bau Island (Fiji)|Bau Island]] was able to become a powerful influence in the region. His father was [[Ratu]] [[Tanoa Visawaqa]], the [[Vunivalu of Bau|Vunivalu]] (a chiefly title meaning ''Warlord,'' often translated also as ''Paramount Chief'') who had previously defeated the much larger [[Burebasaga]] confederacy and succeeded in subduing much of western Fiji. Cakobau, following on from his father, became so dominant that he was able to expel the Europeans from Levuka for five years over a dispute about their giving of weapons to his local enemies. In the early 1850s, Cakobau went one step further and decided to declare war on all Christians. His plans were thwarted after the missionaries in Fiji received support from the already converted Tongans and the presence of a British warship. The Tongan Prince [[Enele Ma'afu]], a Christian, had established himself on the Island of [[Lakeba]] in the [[Lau Islands|Lau]] archipelago in 1848, forcibly converting the local people to the [[Methodism|Methodist Church]].  Cakobau and other chiefs in the west of Fiji regarded Ma'afu as a threat to their power and resisted his attempts to expand Tonga's dominion. Cakobau's influence, however, began to wane and his heavy imposition of taxes on other Fijian chiefs, who saw him at best as [[Primus inter pares|first among equals]], caused them to defect from him.<ref>[[#Gravelle|Gravelle]], pp. 67\u201380}</ref>\n\nAround this time the [[United States]] also became interested in asserting their power in the region and they threatened intervention following a number of incidents involving their consul in the Fiji islands, [[John Brown Williams]].  In 1849, Williams had his trading store looted following an accidental fire, caused by stray cannon fire during a [[Fourth of July]] celebration, and in 1853 the European settlement of Levuka was burnt to the ground. Williams blamed Cakobau for both these incidents and the US representative wanted Cakobau's capital at Bau destroyed in retaliation. A naval blockade was instead set up around the island which put further pressure on Cakobau to give up on his warfare against the foreigners and their Christian allies. Finally, on April 30, 1854, Cakobau offered his ''soro'' (supplication) and yielded to these forces. He underwent the \"lotu\" and converted to Christianity. The traditional Fijian temples in Bau were destroyed and the sacred ''nokonoko'' trees were cut down. Cakobau and his remaining men were then compelled to join with the Tongans, backed by the Americans and British, to subjugate the remaining chiefs in the region who still refused to convert. These chiefs were soon defeated with Qaraniqio of the [[Rewa Province|Rewa]] being poisoned and Ratu Mara of Kaba being hanged in 1855. After these wars, most regions of Fiji, except for the interior highland areas, had been forced into giving up much of their traditional systems and were now vassals of Western interest. Cakobau was retained as a largely symbolic representative of the Fijian people and was allowed to take the ironic title of \"Tui Viti\" (\"King of Fiji\"), but the overarching control now lay with foreign powers.<ref>[[#Gravelle|Gravelle]], pp. 76\u201397</ref>\n\n=== Cotton, confederacies and the Kai Colo ===\n[[File:Tui Namosi, Kai Colo.jpg|thumb|left|Kai Colo warrior]]\nThe rising price of cotton in the wake of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) saw a flood of hundreds of settlers come to Fiji in the 1860s from [[Australia]] and the [[United States]] in order to obtain land and grow cotton. Since there was still a lack of functioning government in Fiji, these planters were often able to get the land in violent or fraudulent ways such as exchanging weapons or alcohol with Fijians who may or may not have been the true owners. Although this made for cheap land acquisition, competing land claims between the planters became problematic with no unified government to resolve the disputes. In 1865, the settlers proposed a confederacy of the seven main native kingdoms in Fiji to establish some sort of government. This was initially successful and Cakobau was elected as the first president of the confederacy.<ref>[[#Gravelle|Gravelle]], p. 102</ref>\n[[File:Flag of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of Fiji.svg|thumb|Flag of the Confederacy of Independent Kingdoms of Fiji, 1865\u20131867]]\n\nWith the demand for land high, the white planters started to push into the hilly interior of [[Viti Levu]], the largest island in the archipelago. This put them into direct confrontation with the Kai Colo, which was a general term to describe the various Fijian clans resident to these inland districts. The Kai Colo were still living a mostly traditional lifestyle, they were not Christianised and they were not under the rule of Cakobau or the confederacy. In 1867, a travelling missionary named [[Thomas Baker (missionary)|Thomas Baker]] was killed by Kai Colo in the mountains at the headwaters of the [[Sigatoka River]]. The acting British consul, [[John Bates Thurston]], demanded that Cakobau lead a force of Fijians from coastal areas to suppress the Kai Colo. Cakobau eventually led a campaign into the mountains but suffered a humiliating loss with 61 of his fighters being killed.<ref>[[#Gravelle|Gravelle]], pp. 102\u2013107</ref> Settlers also came into conflict with the local eastern Kai Colo people called the Wainimala. [[John Bates Thurston]] called in the [[Australia Station]] section of the [[Royal Navy]] for assistance. The Navy duly sent Commander [[Rowley Lambert]] and {{HMS|Challenger|1858|6}} to conduct a punitive mission against the Wainimala. An armed force of 87 men shelled and burnt the village of Deoka and a skirmish ensued which resulted in the deaths of over forty Wainimala.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article166803071 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[Sydney Mail]] |volume=IX, |issue=429 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=19 September 1868 |accessdate=9 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n=== Kingdom of Fiji (1871\u20131874) ===\n{{main|Kingdom of Fiji}}\n[[File:Flag_of_the_Kingdom_of_Fiji_(1871-1874).svg|thumb|Flag of the [[Kingdom of Fiji]], 1871\u20131874]]\nAfter the collapse of the confederacy, [[Enele Ma'afu|Ma'afu]] established a stable administration in the [[Lau Islands]] and the Tongans, therefore, were again becoming influential. Other foreign powers such as the United States were also considering the possibility of annexing Fiji. This situation was not appealing to many settlers, almost all of whom were British subjects from [[Australia]]. Britain, however, still refused to annex the country and subsequently a compromise was needed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63106962 |title=The Empire. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=5767 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=11 May 1870 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn June 1871, [[George Austin Woods]], an ex-lieutenant of the Royal Navy, managed to influence [[Cakobau]] and organise a group of like-minded settlers and chiefs into forming a governing administration. Cakobau was declared the monarch (''Tui Viti'') and the Kingdom of Fiji was established. Most Fijian chiefs agreed to participate and even Ma'afu chose to recognise Cakobau and participate in the [[constitutional monarchy]]. However, many of the settlers had come from British colonies like [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[New South Wales]] where negotiation with the [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous people]] almost universally involved the barrel of a gun. As a result, several aggressive, racially motivated opposition groups, such as the British Subjects Mutual Protection Society, sprouted up. One group called themselves the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in a homage to the [[white supremacist]] group in America.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article191569882 |title=No title |newspaper=[[The Ballarat Courier]] |issue=1538 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=22 May 1872 |accessdate=10 April 2018 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> However, when respected individuals such as [[Charles St Julian]], Robert Sherson Swanston and John Bates Thurston were appointed by Cakobau, a degree of authority was established.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60446405 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=Illustrated Australian News For Home Readers |issue=187 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=16 July 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=154 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Three kai colo, ca. 1873, carte de visite by Francis Herbert Dufty.jpg|thumb|left|Three Kai Colo men in traditional Fijian attire]]\nWith the rapid increase in white settlers into the country, the desire for land acquisition also intensified. Once again, conflict with the Kai Colo in the interior of [[Viti Levu]] ensued. In 1871, the killing of two settlers named Spiers and Mackintosh near the [[Ba River (Fiji)]] in the north-west of the island prompted a large [[punitive expedition]] of white farmers, imported slave labourers and coastal Fijians to be organised. This group of around 400 armed vigilantes, including veterans of the [[US Civil War]], had a battle with the Kai Colo near the village of Cubu in which both sides had to withdraw. The village was destroyed and the Kai Colo, despite being armed with muskets, received numerous casualties.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158947917 |title=FIJIAN EXPERIENCES. |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |volume=XXVIII, |issue=1576 |location=South Australia |date=16 December 1871 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}\n</ref> The Kai Colo responded by making frequent raids on the settlements of the whites and Christian Fijians throughout the [[Ba (province)|district of Ba]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170155477 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[Advocate]] |volume=IV, |issue=160 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=3 February 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=11 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Likewise, in the east of the island on the upper reaches of the [[Rewa River]], villages were burnt and a \"great many\" Kai Colo were shot by the vigilante settler squad called the Rewa Rifles.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170157875 |title=MASSACRE OF NATIVES BY SETTLERS IN FIJI. |newspaper=[[Advocate]] |volume=IV, |issue=196 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=12 October 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the Cakobau government did not approve of the settlers taking justice into their own hands, it did want the Kai Colo subjugated and their land sold off. The solution was to form an army. Robert S. Swanston, the minister for Native Affairs in the Kingdom, organised the training and arming of suitable Fijian volunteers and prisoners to become soldiers in what was invariably called the King's Troops or the Native Regiment. In a similar system to the [[Native Police]] that was present in the colonies of [[Australia]], two white settlers, James Harding and W. Fitzgerald, were appointed as the head officers of this paramilitary brigade.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article194847556 |title=LETTER FROM FIJI. |newspaper=[[Hamilton Spectator]] |issue=1083 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=14 August 1872 |accessdate=11 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> The formation of this force did not sit well with many of the white plantation owners as they did not trust an army of Fijians to protect their interests.\n\nThe situation intensified further in early 1873 when the Burns family were killed by a Kai Colo raid in the Ba River area. The Cakobau government deployed 50 King's Troopers to the region under the command of Major Fitzgerald to restore order. The local whites, with their own large force under the leadership of Mr White and Mr de Courcy Ireland, refused their posting and a further deployment of another 50 troops under Captain Harding was sent to emphasise the government's authority. To prove the worth of the Native Regiment, this augmented force went into the interior and massacred about 170 Kai Colo people at Na Korowaiwai. Upon returning to the coast, the force were met by the white settlers who still saw the government troops as a threat. A skirmish between the government's troops and the white settlers' brigade was only prevented by the timely intervention of Captain William Cox Chapman of {{HMS|Dido|1869|6}} who promptly detained Mr White and Mr de Courcy Ireland, forcing the group to disband. The authority of the King's Troops and the Cakobau government to crush the Kai Colo was now total.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5851961 |title=FIJI. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)]] |issue=8 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=16 April 1873 |accessdate=12 April 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nFrom March to October 1873, a force of about 200 King's Troops under the general administration of R.S. Swanston with around 1000 coastal Fijian and white volunteer auxiliaries, led a campaign throughout the highlands of Viti Levu to annihilate the Kai Colo. Major Fitzgerald and Major H.C. Thurston (the brother of [[John Bates Thurston]]) led a two pronged attack throughout the region. The combined forces of the different clans of the Kai Colo made a stand at the village of Na Culi. The Kai Colo were defeated with dynamite and fire being used to flush them out from their defensive positions amongst the mountain caves. Many Kai Colo were killed and one of the main leaders of the hill clans, Ratu Dradra, was forced to surrender with around 2000 men, women and children being taken prisoner and sent to the coast.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article63234385 |title=LATEST FROM FIJI. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=668 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=29 August 1873 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> In the months after this defeat, the only main resistance was from the clans around the village of Nibutautau.

The [[American Civil War]] had cut off the supply of cotton to the international market when the Union blockaded southern ports. Cotton cultivation was potentially an extremely profitable business. Thousands of European planters flocked to Fiji to establish plantations but found the natives unwilling to adapt to their plans. They sought labour from the [[Melanesia]]n islands. On 5 July 1865 [[Ben Pease]] received the first licence to provide 40 labourers from the [[New Hebrides]] to Fiji.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janesoceania.com/oceania_blackbirding1/index.htm |title=The Story of Blackbirding in the South Seas \u2013 Part 2 |author=Jane Resture| publisher=Janesoceania.com |date= |accessdate=9 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[Queensland]] governments tried to regulate this recruiting and transport of labour. Melanesian labourers were to be recruited for a term of three years, paid three pounds per year, issued with basic clothing and given access to the company store for supplies. Most Melanesians were recruited by deceit, usually being enticed aboard ships with gifts, and then locked up. The living and working conditions for them in Fiji were worse than those suffered by the later [[Demographics of India|Indian]] [[indenture]]d labourers. In 1875, the chief medical officer in Fiji, Sir [[William MacGregor]], listed a mortality rate of 540 out of every 1000 labourers. After the expiry of the three-year contract, the government required captains to transport the labourers back to their villages, but most ship captains dropped them off at the first island they sighted off the Fiji waters. The British sent warships to enforce the law (Pacific Islanders' Protection Act of 1872) but only a small proportion of the culprits were prosecuted.\n\n[[File:Seizure of blackbirder Daphne.jpg|thumb|left|Seizure of the blackbirder ''Daphne'']]\nA notorious incident of the blackbirding trade was the 1871 voyage of the [[brig]] ''Carl'', organised by Dr James Patrick Murray,<ref name=\"G.

As the white settler backed Cakobau government, and later the British colonial government, subjugated areas in Fiji under its power, the resultant prisoners of war were regularly sold at auction to the planters. This not only provided a source of revenue for the government, but also dispersed the rebels to different, often isolated islands where the plantations were located. The land that was occupied by these people before they became slaves was then also sold off for additional revenue. An example of this is the Lovoni people of [[Ovalau (Fiji)|Ovalau island]], who after being defeated in a war with the Cakobau government in 1871, were rounded up and sold off to the settlers at \u20a46 per head. Two thousand Lovoni men, women and children were sold and their period of slavery lasted five years.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60865675 |title=A FIJIAN PLANTER'S CONFESSION. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=6379 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 September 1872 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Likewise, after the Kai Colo wars in 1873, thousands of people from the hill tribes of [[Viti Levu]] were sent to [[Levuka]] and sold into slavery.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article198499905 |title=GENERAL NEWS. |newspaper=[[Leader]] |volume=XXVII, |issue=940 |location=Victoria, Australia |date=3 January 1874 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=24 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Warnings from the [[Royal Navy]] stationed in the area that buying these people was illegal were largely given without enforcement and the British consul in Fiji, Edward Bernard Marsh, regularly turned a blind eye to this type of labour trade.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60874042 |title=NINE MONTHS IN FIJI AND OTHER ISLANDS. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Empire]] |issue=6014 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=13 July 1871 |accessdate=13 April 2018 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n=== British colony ===\n{{Main|Colony of Fiji|British Western Pacific Territories}}\n\n==== Annexation by the British in 1874 ====\nDespite achieving military victories over the Kai Colo, the Cakobau government was faced with problems of legitimacy and economic viability. Indigenous Fijians and white settlers refused to pay taxes and the cotton price had collapsed. With these major issues in mind, [[John Bates Thurston]] approached the British government, at Cakobau's request, with another offer to cede the islands.  The newly elected [[Tory]] British government under [[Benjamin Disraeli]] encouraged expansion of the empire and was therefore much more sympathetic to annexing Fiji than it had been previously.\nThe murder of Bishop [[John Coleridge Patteson]] of the [[Melanesian Mission]] at [[Nukapu]] in the [[Reef Islands]] had provoked public outrage, which was compounded by the massacre by crew members of more than 150 Fijians on board the brig ''Carl.''  Two British commissioners were sent to Fiji to investigate the possibility of an annexation.  The question was complicated by manoeuvrings for power between Cakobau and his old rival, [[Enele Ma'afu|Ma'afu]], with both men vacillating for many months. On 21 March 1874, Cakobau made a final offer, which the British accepted.  On 23 September, [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]], soon to be appointed the [[British Empire|British]] [[Governor of Fiji]], arrived on [[HMS Dido (1869)|HMS ''Dido'']] and received Cakobau with a royal 21-gun salute. After some vacillation, Cakobau agreed to renounce his ''[[Tui Viti]]'' title, retaining the title of ''Vunivalu'', or Protector. The formal cession took place on 10 October 1874, when Cakobau, Ma'afu, and some of the senior Chiefs of Fiji signed two copies of the [[Deed of Cession (Fiji)|Deed of Cession]].  Thus the [[Colony of Fiji]] was founded; 96 years of British rule followed.\n\n==== Measles epidemic of 1875 ====\nTo celebrate the annexation of Fiji, Hercules Robinson, who was [[Governor of New South Wales]] at the time, took Cakobau and his two sons to [[Sydney]].

On returning to Fiji, the colonial administrators decided not to quarantine the ship that the convalescents travelled in. This was despite the British having a very extensive knowledge of the devastating effect of infectious disease on an unexposed population. In 1875\u201376, an epidemic of [[measles]] resultant of this decision killed over 40,000 Fijians,<ref>[http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=645:our-country&catid=68:about-fiji-&Itemid=196 \u201cHistorical Time line\u201d]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140914/http://www.fiji.gov.fj/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=645%3Aour-country&catid=68%3Aabout-fiji-&Itemid=196 |date=29 June 2011 }}.

Gordon was immediately faced with an insurgency of the Qalimari and Kai Colo people. In early 1875, colonial administrator [[Edgar Leopold Layard]], had met with thousands of highland clans at Navuso in [[Viti Levu]] to formalise their subjugation to British rule and the Christian religion. Layard and his delegation managed to spread the [[measles]] epidemic to the highlanders, causing mass deaths in this population. As a result, anger at the British colonists flared throughout the region and a widespread uprising quickly took hold. Villages along the [[Sigatoka River]] and in the highlands above this area refused British control and Gordon was tasked with quashing this rebellion.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes written during the disturbances in the highlands of Viti Levu, 1876|date=1879|publisher=R&R Clark|location=Edinburgh|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes01stangoog}}</ref>\n\nIn what Gordon himself termed the \"Little War\", the suppression of this uprising took the form of two co-ordinated military campaigns in the western half of Viti Levu. The first was conducted by Gordon's second cousin, Arthur John Lewis Gordon, against the Qalimari insurgents along the Sigatoka River. The second campaign was led by [[Louis Knollys]] against the Kai Colo in the mountains to the north of the river. Governor Gordon invoked a type of martial law in the area where A.J.L. Gordon and Knollys had absolute power to conduct their missions outside of any restrictions of legislation. The two groups of rebels were kept isolated from each other by a force led by Walter Carew and [[George Le Hunte]] who were stationed at Nasaucoko. Carew also ensured the rebellion did not spread east by securing the loyalty of the Wainimala people of the eastern highlands. The war involved the use of the soldiers of the old Native Regiment of Cakobau supported by around 1500 Christian Fijian volunteers from other areas of Viti Levu. The colonial [[Government of New Zealand]] provided most of the advanced weapons for the army including one hundred [[Snider Rifle|Snider rifles]].\n\nThe campaign along the Sigatoka River was conducted under a [[scorched earth]] policy whereby numerous rebel villages were burnt and their fields ransacked. After the capture and destruction of the main fortified towns of Koroivatuma, Bukutia and Matanavatu, the Qalimari surrendered ''en masse''. Those who weren't killed in the fighting were taken prisoner and sent to the coastal town of Cuvu. This included 827 men, women and children as well as the leader of the insurgents, a man named Mudu. The women and children were distributed to places like [[Nadi]] and [[Nadroga-Navosa Province|Nadroga]]. Of the men, 15 were sentenced to death at a hastily conducted trial at [[Sigatoka]]. Governor Gordon was present, but chose to leave the judicial responsibility to his relative, A.J.L. Gordon. Four were hanged and ten, including Mudu, were shot with one prisoner managing to escape. By the end of proceedings the Governor noted that \"my feet were literally stained with the blood that I had shed\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes Vol. 1|date=1879|page=441|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes01stangoog|publisher=Privately printed by R . and R. Clark}}</ref>\n\nThe northern campaign against the Kai Colo in the highlands was similar but involved removing the rebels from large, well protected caves in the region. Knollys managed to clear the caves \"after some considerable time and large expenditure of ammunition\". The occupants of these caves included whole communities and as a result many men, women and children were either killed or wounded in these operations. The rest were taken prisoner and sent to the towns on the northern coast. The chief medical officer in British Fiji, [[William MacGregor]], also took part both in killing Kai Colo and tending to their wounded. After the caves were taken, the Kai Colo surrendered and their leader, Bisiki, was captured. Various trials were held, mostly at Nasaucoko under Le Hunte, and 32 men were either hanged or shot including Bisiki, who was killed trying to escape.<ref name=\"Letters and Notes Vol. 2\">{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Arthur Hamilton|title=Letters and Notes Vol. 2|date=1879|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersandnotes00stangoog|publisher=Privately printed by R . and R. Clark}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of October 1876, the \"Little War\" was over and Gordon had succeeded in vanquishing the rebels in the interior of Viti Levu. Those insurgents who weren't killed or executed were sent into exile with hard labour for up to 10 years. Some non-combatants were allowed to return to rebuild their villages, but many areas in the highlands were ordered by Gordon to remain depopulated and in ruins. Gordon also constructed a military fortress, Fort Canarvon, at the headwaters of the Sigatoka River where a large contingent of soldiers were based to maintain British control. He renamed the Native Regiment, the [[Armed Native Constabulary]] to lessen its appearance of being a military force.<ref name=\"Letters and Notes Vol. 2\"/>\n \nIn order to further consolidate social control throughout the colony, Governor Gordon introduced a system of appointed chiefs and village constables in the various districts to both enact his orders and report any disobedience from the populace. Gordon adopted the chiefly titles ''Roko'' and ''Buli'' to describe these deputies and established a [[Great Council of Chiefs]] which was directly subject to his authority as Supreme Chief.  This body remained in existence until being suspended by the [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces|Military]]-backed interim government in 2007 and only abolished in 2012.\nGordon also extinguished the ability of Fijians to own, buy or sell land as individuals, the control being transferred to colonial authorities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=France|first1=Peter|title=The founding of an orthodoxy: Sir Arthur Gordon and the doctrine of the Fijian way of life|journal=Journal of the Polynesian Society|date=1968|volume=77|issue=1|pages=6\u201332|url=http://www.jps.auckland.ac.nz/document/Volume_77_1968/Volume_77%2C_No._1/The_founding_of_an_orthodoxy%3A_Sir_Arthur_Gordon_and_the_doctrine_of_the_Fijian_way_of_life%2C_by_Peter_France%2C_p_6_-_32|accessdate=16 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Indian indenture system in Fiji====\n{{main|Indian indenture system|Indian indenture ships to Fiji|Repatriation of indentured Indians from Fiji}}\nGordon decided in 1878 to import indentured labourers from [[India]] to work on the [[sugarcane]] fields that had taken the place of the cotton plantations.  The 463 Indians arrived on 14 May 1879 \u2013 the first of some 61,000 that were to come before the scheme ended in 1916.  The plan involved bringing the Indian workers to Fiji on a five-year contract, after which they could return to India at their own expense; if they chose to renew their contract for a second five-year term, they would be given the option of returning to India at the government's expense, or remaining in Fiji.  The great majority chose to stay.  The [[Queensland Act]], which regulated indentured labour in Queensland, was made law in Fiji also.\n\nBetween 1879 and 1916, tens of thousands of Indians moved to Fiji to work as [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]], especially on [[sugarcane]] [[plantation]]s. A total of 42 ships made 87 voyages, carrying Indian [[indenture]]d labourers to Fiji. Initially the ships brought labourers from [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], but from 1903 all ships except two also brought labourers from [[Madras]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]]. A total of 60,965 passengers left India but only 60,553 (including births at sea) arrived in Fiji. A total of 45,439 boarded ships in Calcutta and 15,114 in Madras. [[Sailing ship]]s took, on average, seventy-three days for the trip while steamers took 30 days. The shipping companies associated with the labour trade were [[Nourse Line]] and [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]].\n\n[[Repatriation of indentured Indians from Fiji]] began on 3 May 1892, when the ''[[British Peer (ship)|British Peer]]'' brought 464 repatriated Indians to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. Various ships made similar journeys to Calcutta and [[Chennai|Madras]], concluding with ''Sirsa''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s 1951 voyage. In 1955 and 1956, three ships brought Indian labourers from Fiji to Sydney, from where the labourers flew to [[Mumbai|Bombay]].\nIndentured Indians wishing to return to India were given two options. One was travel at their own expense and the other free of charge but subject to certain conditions. To obtain free passage back to India, labourers had to have been above age twelve upon arrival, completed at least five years of service and lived in Fiji for a total of ten consecutive years. A child born to these labourers in Fiji could accompany his or her parents or guardian back to India if he or she was under twelve.\nDue to the high cost of returning at their own expense, most indentured immigrants returning to India left Fiji around ten to twelve years after arrival. Indeed, just over twelve years passed between the voyage of the first ship carrying indentured Indians to Fiji (the ''[[Leonidas (ship)|Leonidas]]'', in 1879) and the first ship to take Indians back (the ''[[British Peer (ship)|British Peer]]'', in 1892).\nGiven the steady influx of ships carrying indentured Indians to Fiji up until 1916, repatriated Indians generally boarded these same ships on their return voyage. The total number of repatriates under the Fiji indenture system is recorded as 39,261, while the number of arrivals is said to have been 60,553. Because the return figure includes children born in Fiji, many of the indentured Indians never returned to India.\nDirect return voyages by ship ceased after 1951. Instead, arrangements were made for flights from Sydney to Bombay, the first of which departed in July 1955. Labourers still travelled to Sydney by ship.\n\n==== The Tuka rebellions ====\nWith almost all aspects of indigenous Fijian social life being controlled by British authorities, a number of charismatic individuals preaching dissent and return to pre-colonial culture were able to forge a following amongst the disenfranchised. These movements were called Tuka, which roughly translates as \"those who stand up\". The first Tuka movement, was led by Ndoongumoy, better known as Navosavakandua which means \"he who speaks only once\". He told his followers that if they returned to traditional ways and worshipped traditional deities such as Degei and Rokola, their current condition would be transformed with the whites and their puppet Fijian chiefs being subservient to them. Navosavakandua was previously exiled from the [[Viti Levu]] highlands in 1878 for disturbing the peace and the British quickly arrested him and his followers after this open display of rebellion. He was again exiled, this time to [[Rotuma]] where he died soon after his 10-year sentence ended.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brewster|first1=Adolph|title=Hill tribes of Fiji|date=1922|page=236|url=https://archive.org/details/hilltribesoffiji00brew|publisher=London Seeley, Service}}</ref>\n\nOther Tuka organisations, however, soon appeared. The British were ruthless in their suppression of both the leaders and followers with figureheads such as Sailose being banished to an asylum for 12 years. In 1891, entire populations of villages who were sympathetic to the Tuka ideology were deported as punishment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=Martha|title=Neither Cargo nor Cult|date=1995|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=100\u2013118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3ey0ms3khaAC|isbn=978-0822315933}}</ref> Three years later in the highlands of [[Vanua Levu]], where locals had re-engaged in traditional religion, the [[Governor of Fiji]], [[John Bates Thurston]], ordered in the Armed Native Constabulary to destroy the towns and the religious relics.

The company was called the Viti Kabani and it was a hugely successful. The British and their proxy Council of Chiefs were not able to prevent the Viti Kabani's rise and again the colonists were forced to send in the Armed Native Constabulary. Apolosi and his followers were arrested in 1915 and the company collapsed in 1917. Over the next 30 years, Apolosi was re-arrested, jailed and exiled, with the British viewing him as a threat right up to his death in 1946.<ref>[[#Gravelle|Gravelle]], pp. 179\u2013183</ref>\n\n====Fiji in World War I and II====\nFiji was only peripherally involved in [[World War I]].  One memorable incident occurred in September 1917 when [[Count]] [[Felix von Luckner]] arrived at [[Wakaya Island]], off the eastern coast of Viti Levu, after his raider, {{SMS|Seeadler|1888|6}}, had [[Ship grounding|run aground]] in the [[Cook Islands]] following the shelling of [[Papeete]] in the French territory of [[Tahiti]].  On 21 September, the district police inspector took a number of Fijians to Wakaya, and von Luckner, not realizing that they were unarmed, unwittingly surrendered.\n\nCiting unwillingness to exploit the Fijian people, the [[British Empire|colonial authorities]] did not permit Fijians to enlist.  One Fijian of chiefly rank, a greatgrandson of Cakobau's, did join the [[French Foreign Legion]], however, and received [[France]]'s highest military decoration, the [[Croix de guerre 1914\u20131918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]].  After going on to complete a [[LLB|Law]] degree at [[Oxford University]], this same chief returned to Fiji in 1921 as both a war hero and the country's first-ever university graduate.  In the years that followed, [[Lala Sukuna|Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna]], as he was later known, established himself as the most powerful chief in Fiji and forged embryonic institutions for what would later become the modern Fijian nation.\n\n[[File:Flag of Fiji (1924\u20131970).svg|thumb|Flag of Fiji 1924\u20131970]]\nBy the time of [[World War II]], the United Kingdom had reversed its policy of not enlisting natives, and many thousands of Fijians volunteered for the [[Fiji Infantry Regiment]], which was under the command of [[Edward Cakobau|Ratu Sir Edward Cakobau]], another greatgrandson of Seru Epenisa Cakobau. The regiment was attached to New Zealand and Australian army units during the war.\n\nBecause of its central location, Fiji was selected as a training base for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].  An airstrip was built at [[Nadi]] (later to become an international airport), and gun emplacements studded the coast.  Fijians gained a reputation for bravery in the [[Solomon Islands campaign]], with one war correspondent describing their ambush tactics as \"death with velvet gloves\". Corporal [[Sefanaia Sukanaivalu]], of [[Yucata]], was [[Posthumous recognition|posthumously]] awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], as a result of his bravery in the [[Bougainville campaign (1943-45)|Battle of Bougainville]].\n\n====Responsible government====\n[[File:Kamisese Mara.jpg|thumb|[[Kamisese Mara]]]]\nA constitutional conference was held in [[London]] in July 1965, to discuss constitutional changes with a view to introducing responsible government.  Indo-Fijians, led by [[A. D. Patel]], demanded the immediate introduction of full self-government, with a fully elected legislature, to be elected by universal suffrage on a common voters' roll.  These demands were vigorously rejected by the [[Fijians|ethnic Fijian]] delegation, who still feared loss of control over natively owned land and resources should an Indo-Fijian dominated government come to power.  The British made it clear, however, that they were determined to bring Fiji to self-government and eventual independence.  Realizing that they had no choice, Fiji's chiefs decided to negotiate for the best deal they could get.\n\nA series of compromises led to the establishment of a cabinet system of government in 1967, with [[Kamisese Mara|Ratu Kamisese Mara]] as the first [[Chief Minister of Fiji|Chief Minister]].  Ongoing negotiations between Mara and [[Sidiq Koya]], who had taken over the leadership of the mainly Indo-Fijian [[National Federation Party]] on Patel's death in 1969, led to a second constitutional conference in London, in April 1970, at which Fiji's Legislative Council agreed on a compromise electoral formula and a timetable for independence as a fully sovereign and independent nation with the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]].  The Legislative Council would be replaced with a bicameral [[Parliament of Fiji|Parliament]], with a [[Senate of Fiji|Senate]] dominated by Fijian chiefs and a popularly elected [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]].  In the 52-member House, Native Fijians and Indo-Fijians would each be allocated 22 seats, of which 12 would represent ''[[Communal constituencies]]'' comprising voters registered on strictly ethnic roles, and another 10 representing ''[[National constituencies]]'' to which members were allocated by ethnicity but elected by [[universal suffrage]].  A further 8 seats were reserved for \"[[General electors]]\" \u2013 [[European ethnic groups|Europeans]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Banaba Island|Banaban Islanders]], and other minorities; 3 of these were \"communal\" and 5 \"national\".  With this compromise, Fiji became independent on 10 October 1970.\n\n=== Independence (1970) ===\nThe British granted Fiji independence in 1970. Democratic rule was interrupted by two [[1987 Fijian coups d'\u00e9tat|military coups]] in 1987 precipitated by a growing perception that the government was dominated by the [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] (Indian) community. The second 1987 coup saw both the Fijian monarchy and the [[Governor-General of Fiji|Governor General]] replaced by a non-executive president and the name of the country changed from ''[[British Dominions|Dominion]] of Fiji'' to ''Republic of Fiji'' and then in 1997 to ''Republic of the Fiji Islands''. The two coups and the accompanying civil unrest contributed to heavy Indo-Fijian emigration; the resulting population loss resulted in economic difficulties and ensured that Melanesians became the majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationinformation.org/Profiles/display.cfm?ID=110|title=Fiji Islands: From Immigration to Emigration |last=Lal|first=Brij V|date=April 2003|publisher=Migration Policy Institute|accessdate=14 June 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, the new constitution institutionalised ethnic Fijian domination of the political system. The [[Group Against Racial Discrimination]] (GARD) was formed to oppose the unilaterally imposed constitution and to restore the 1970 constitution. In 1992 [[Sitiveni Rabuka]], the Lieutenant Colonel who had carried out the 1987 coup, became Prime Minister following elections held under the new constitution. Three years later, Rabuka established the [[Constitutional Review Commission (Fiji)|Constitutional Review Commission]], which in 1997 wrote a new constitution which was supported by most leaders of the indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian communities. Fiji was re-admitted to the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nThe year 2000 brought along [[2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|another coup]], instigated by [[George Speight]], which effectively toppled the government of [[Mahendra Chaudhry]], who in 1997 had become the country's first Indo-Fijian Prime Minister following the adoption of the new constitution. Commodore [[Frank Bainimarama]] assumed executive power after the resignation, possibly forced, of President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara. Later in 2000, Fiji was rocked by [[Mutinies of the 2000 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat|two mutinies]] when rebel soldiers went on a rampage at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks. The [[High Court of Fiji|High Court]] ordered the reinstatement of the constitution, and in September 2001, to restore democracy, a general election was held which was won by interim Prime Minister [[Laisenia Qarase]]'s [[Soqosoqo Duavata ni Lewenivanua]] party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lal|first=Brij V.|date=2002|title=In George Speight's Shadow: Fiji General Elections of 2001|journal=The Journal of Pacific History|volume=37|issue=1|pages=87\u2013101|jstor=25169576}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the Qarase government amid much controversy proposed a [[Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill|Reconciliation and Unity Commission]] with power to recommend compensation for victims of the 2000 coup and amnesty for its perpetrators. However, the military, especially the nation's top military commander, Frank Bainimarama, strongly opposed this bill. Bainimarama agreed with detractors who said that to grant amnesty to supporters of the present government who had played a role in the violent coup was a sham. His attack on the legislation, which continued unremittingly throughout May and into June and July, further strained his already tense relationship with the government.\n\nIn late November and early December 2006, Bainimarama was instrumental in the [[2006 Fijian coup d'\u00e9tat]]. Bainimarama handed down a list of demands to Qarase after a bill was put forward to parliament, part of which would have offered pardons to participants in the 2000 coup attempt. He gave Qarase an ultimatum date of 4 December to accede to these demands or to resign from his post. Qarase adamantly refused either to concede or resign, and on 5 December the president, Ratu [[Josefa Iloilo]], was said to have signed a legal order dissolving the parliament after meeting with Bainimarama.\n\nIn April 2009, the [[Court of Appeal of Fiji|Fiji Court of Appeal]] ruled that the 2006 coup had been illegal. This began the [[2009 Fijian constitutional crisis]]. President Iloilo abrogated the constitution, removed all office holders under the constitution including all judges and the governor of the Central Bank. He then reappointed Bainimarama under his \"New Order\" as interim Prime Minister and imposed a \"Public Emergency Regulation\" limiting internal travel and allowing press censorship.\n\nFor a country of its size, Fiji has fairly large armed forces, and has been a [[Fiji and the United Nations|major contributor]] to [[UN peacekeeping]] missions in various parts of the world. In addition, a significant number of former military personnel have served in the lucrative security sector in [[Iraq]] following the 2003 [[United States|US]]-led invasion.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Hermione Gee|title=Fijian peacekeepers in Iraq aren't just a battalion \u2014 they're a choir|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2014-09-05/fijian-peacekeepers-iraq-arent-just-battalion-theyre-choir|website=Public Radio International}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Fiji}}\n{{See also|Flora and fauna of Fiji}}\n\n[[File:Fiji and oceania.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Fiji's location in Oceania.]]\n[[File:Fiji map.png|thumb|upright=1.15|A map of Fiji]]\n[[File:Fiji topo.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Topography of Fiji]]\n[[File:The Point (Fiji).jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Coconut]] palms line the beaches of Fiji]]\n\nFiji covers a total area of some {{convert|194000|km2}} of which around 10% is land.\n\nFiji is the hub of the South West Pacific, midway between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Tonga]].

The Fiji national side did not match that feat again until the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] when they upset [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] 38\u201334 to progress to the quarter-finals where they lost to the eventual Rugby World Cup winners, [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]]. Fiji also defeated the British and Irish Lions in 1977.\n\nFiji competes in the [[Pacific Tri-Nations]] and the [[IRB Pacific Nations Cup]]. The sport is governed by the [[Fiji Rugby Union]] which is a member of the [[Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance]], and contributes to the [[Pacific Islanders rugby union team]]. At the club level there are the [[Skipper Cup]] and [[Farebrother Trophy Challenge]].\n\nThe Fiji national rugby union team is a member of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) formerly along with Samoa and Tonga. In 2009, Samoa announced their departure from the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance, leaving just Fiji and Tonga in the union. Fiji is currently ranked eleventh in the world by the IRB ({{as of|2015|December|28|lc=y}}).\n\nFiji is one of the few countries where rugby union is the main sport. There are about 80,000 registered players from a total population of around 900,000. One of the problems for Fiji is simply getting their players to play for their home country, as many have contracts in Europe with the French [[Top 14]] and the English [[Aviva Premiership]] or with [[Super Rugby]] teams, where monetary compensation is far more rewarding. The repatriated salaries of its overseas stars have become an important part of some local economies. In addition, a significant number of players eligible to play for Fiji end up representing Australia or New Zealand; notable examples are Fiji-born cousins and former [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand All Blacks]], Joe Rokocoko and Sitiveni Sivivatu, current All Blacks [[Waisake Naholo]] and Seta Tamanivalu as well as [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian Wallabies]] former winger, Lote Tuqiri and current Wallabies [[Tevita Kuridrani]], Samu Kerevi and [[Henry Speight]]. Fiji has won the most [[Pacific Tri-Nations]] Championships of the three participating teams.\n\n==== Rugby league ====\n{{Main|Rugby league in Fiji}}\n\nThe [[Fiji national rugby league team]], nicknamed the Bati (pronounced [m\u02c8bat\u0283i]), represents Fiji in the sport of rugby league football and has been participating in international competition since 1992. It has competed in the [[Rugby League World Cup]] on three occasions, with their best results coming when they made consecutive semi-final appearances in the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup]] and [[2013 Rugby League World Cup]]. The team also competes in the [[Pacific Cup]].\n\nMembers of the team are selected from a domestic Fijian competition, as well as from competitions held in New Zealand and Australia. For the 2000, 2008 and 2013 World Cups, the Bati were captained by Lote Tuqiri, [[Wes Naiqama]] and the legendary [[Petero Civoniceva]] respectively. Fiji have also produced stars like [[Akuila Uate]], [[Jarryd Hayne]], [[Kevin Naiqama]], [[Semi Tadulala]], [[Marika Koroibete]], [[Apisai Koroisau]], [[Sisa Waqa]] and the Sims brothers [[Ashton Sims]], [[Tariq Sims]] and [[Korbin Sims]].\n\n==== Rugby war dance (Cibi and Bole) and Fijian hymn ====\nThe [[Cibi]] (pronounced ''Thimbi'') war dance was traditionally performed by the Fiji rugby team before each match. It was replaced in 2012 with the new \"Bole\" (pronounced ''mBolay'') war cry.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rudgard|first1=Olivia|last2=Rothwell|first2=James|title=Never mind the haka \u2013 here's the Bole|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/rugby-world-cup/11871886/Never-mind-the-haka-heres-the-Bole.html|website=The Telegraph|publisher=elegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=4 November 2016|date=18 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nTradition holds that the original Cibi was first performed on the rugby field back in 1939 during a tour of New Zealand, when then Fijian captain Ratu Sir George Cakobau felt that his team should have something to match the [[Haka]] of the All Blacks. The 'Cibi' had perhaps been used incorrectly though, as the word actually means \"a celebration of victory by warriors,\" whereas 'Bole' is the acceptance of a challenge.\n\nThe Fiji Bati rugby league team also gather in a huddle and perform the hymn 'Noqu Masu' before each match.<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.au/video/league/rugby-league/fiji-emotional-pre-game-hymn!520818 ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Association football ====\n[[Association football]] was traditionally a minor sport in Fiji, popular largely amongst the Indo-Fijian community, but with international funding from [[FIFA]] and sound local management over the past decade, the sport has grown in popularity in the wider Fijian community. It is now the second most-popular sport in Fiji, after rugby (union 15's and union 7's) for men, and after netball for women.\n\nThe [[Fiji Football Association]] is a member of the [[Oceania Football Confederation]]. The [[Fiji national football team|national football team]] defeated [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] 2\u20130 in the 2008 [[OFC Nations Cup]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Oceanian Nations Cup 2008 |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/08oc.html | accessdate=6 September 2009}}</ref> on their way to a joint-record third-place finish. However, they have never reached a [[FIFA World Cup]] to date. Fiji won the [[Pacific Games]] football tournament in [[Football at the 1991 South Pacific Games|1991]] and [[Football at the 2003 South Pacific Games|2003]]. Fiji qualified for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] men's tournament for the first time in history.\n\n==== Basketball ====\nDue to the success of Fiji's national basketball teams, the popularity of basketball in Fiji has experienced rapid growth in recent years. In the past, the country only had few basketball courts, which severely limited [[Fijians]] who desired to practice the sport more frequently. Due to recent efforts by the national federation ''Basketball Fiji'' and with the support of the Australian government, many schools have been able to construct courts and provide their students with basketball equipment such as shoes, etc.<ref>[https://www.fiba.com/news/basketball-fiji-bringing-the-sport-to-all Basketball Fiji bringing the sport to all], FIBA.com, 13 May 2016.

The [[Fiji national under-19 cricket team|Fiji U19]] team won the [[2015 EAP Under-19 Cricket Trophy|2015 edition]] of the [[ICC East Asia-Pacific]] tournament, and consequently qualified for the [[2016 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup|2016 Under-19 World Cup]].

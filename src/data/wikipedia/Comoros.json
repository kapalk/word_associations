They also brought Islam to the people of the [[Zanj]] including the Comoros. As the importance of the Comoros grew along the East African coast, both small and large [[mosque]]s were constructed. Despite its distance from the coast, the Comoros is situated along the [[Swahili Coast]] in [[East Africa]].

The islands are officially known by their Comorian language names, though international sources still use their French names (given in parentheses above). The capital and largest city, [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]], is located on Ngazidja. The archipelago is situated in the Indian Ocean, in the [[Mozambique Channel]], between the African coast (nearest to [[Mozambique]] and [[Tanzania]]) and [[Madagascar]], with no land borders.\n\nAt {{convert|2034|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, it is one of the smallest countries in the world. The Comoros also has claim to {{convert|320|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of territorial seas. The interiors of the islands vary from steep mountains to low hills.\n\nNgazidja is the largest of the Comoros Archipelago, approximately equal in area to the other islands combined. It is also the most recent island, and therefore has rocky soil. The island's two volcanoes, [[Mount Karthala|Karthala]] (active) and [[La Grille]] (dormant), and the lack of good harbours are distinctive characteristics of its terrain. Mwali, with its capital at [[Fomboni]], is the smallest of the four major islands. Nzwani, whose capital is [[Mutsamudu]], has a distinctive triangular shape caused by three mountain chains \u2013 [[Sima, Comoros|Sima]], [[Nioumak\u00e9l\u00e9]] and [[Jimilim\u00e9]] \u2013 emanating from a central peak, Mount [[N'Tingui]] ({{convert|1575|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}).\n\nThe islands of the Comoros Archipelago were formed by volcanic activity. Mount Karthala, an active [[shield volcano]] located on Ngazidja, is the country's highest point, at {{convert|2,361|m|abbr=off}}. It contains the Comoros' largest patch of disappearing rainforest. Karthala is currently one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with a minor eruption in May 2006, and prior eruptions as recently as April 2005 and 1991. In the 2005 eruption, which lasted from 17 to 19 April, 40,000 citizens were evacuated, and the [[crater lake]] in the volcano's {{convert|3|by|4|km|mi|abbr=off}} [[caldera]] was destroyed.\n\nThe Comoros also lays claim to the [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean|''\u00celes \u00c9parses'' or ''\u00celes \u00e9parses de l'oc\u00e9an indien'']] (Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean) \u2013 [[Glorioso Islands]], comprising [[Grande Glorieuse]], [[\u00cele du Lys]], [[Wreck Rock]], [[South Rock]], [[Verte Rocks]] (three islets) and three unnamed islets \u2013 one of France's overseas districts. The Glorioso Islands were administered by the colonial Comoros before 1975, and are therefore sometimes considered part of the Comoros Archipelago. [[Banc du Geyser]], a former island in the Comoros Archipelago, now submerged, is geographically located in the ''\u00celes \u00c9parses'', but was annexed by [[Madagascar]] in 1976 as an unclaimed territory. The Comoros and France each still view the Banc du Geyser as part of the Glorioso Islands and, thus, part of its particular exclusive economic zone.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Moroni, Comoros#Geography and climate}}\n\nThe climate is generally tropical and mild, and the two major seasons are distinguishable by their raininess. The temperature reaches an average of {{convert|29|-|30|C|F}} in March, the hottest month in the rainy season (called kashkazi/kaskazi [meaning north monsoon], which runs from December to April), and an average low of {{convert|19|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in the cool, dry season (kusi (meaning south monsoon), which proceeds from May to November).<ref>[[#Ottenheimer|Ottenheimer]], pp. 20, 72</ref> The islands are rarely subject to [[cyclone]]s.\n\n=== Ecology and environment ===\n{{See also|Moheli Marine Park}}\nThe Comoros constitute an [[ecoregion]] in their own right, [[Comoros forests]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn December 1952 a specimen of the [[Coelacanth]] fish was re-discovered off the Comoros coast.

As a practical matter, however, these resolutions have little effect and there is no foreseeable likelihood that Mayotte will become ''de facto'' part of the Comoros without its people's consent. More recently, the Assembly has maintained this item on its agenda but deferred it from year to year without taking action.

It is a language related to [[Swahili language|Swahili]], with four different variants (Shingazidja, Shimwali, Shinzwani and Shimaore) being spoken on each of the four islands. [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts are both used, Arabic being the more widely used, and an [[Official script|official orthography]] has recently been developed for the Latin script.<ref name=chamanga>{{cite book|author= Mohamed Ahmed-Chamanga |title= Introduction \u00e0 la grammaire structurale du comorien|place= Moroni|publisher= Komedit|year=2010}}</ref>\n\n[[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[French language|French]] are also official languages, along with Comorian.

Here, boys and girls are taught about the [[Qur'an]], and memorise it. Some parents specifically choose this early schooling to offset French schools children usually attend later. Since independence and the ejection of French teachers, the education system has been plagued by poor teacher training and poor results, though recent stability may allow for substantial improvements.<ref name=\"Bakar:181-191\" />{{Better source|reason=Source is a decades-old book, but this purports to describe the current situation.|date=September 2018}}\n\nPre-colonization education systems in Comoros focused on necessary skills such as agriculture, caring for livestock and completing household tasks. Religious education also taught children the virtues of Islam. The education system underwent a transformation during colonization in the early 1900s which brought secular education based on the French system. This was mainly for children of the elite. After Comoros gained independence in 1975, the education system changed again. Funding for teachers' salaries was lost, and many went on strike. Thus, the public education system was not functioning between 1997 and 2001. Since gaining independence, the education system has also undergone a democratization and options exist for those other than the elite. Enrollment has also grown.\n\nIn 2000, 44.2% of children ages 5 to 14 years were attending school. There is a general lack of facilities, equipment, qualified teachers, textbooks and other resources. [[Salaries]] for teachers are often so far in arrears that many refuse to work.<ref name=ilab>\"Comoros\".

The little marriage is a simple legal marriage. It is small, intimate, and inexpensive. The bride's dowry is nominal. The little marriage, however, is just a placeholder until the couple can afford the ''ada'', or grand marriage. The hallmarks of the grand marriage are dazzling gold jewelry, two weeks of celebration and an enormous bridal dowry. The groom must pay most of the expenses for this event, and the bride's family typically pays only a third of that of the groom's. The grand wedding can cost up to \u00a355,000.{{Dubious|date=June 2018}} Many men cannot afford this until their late 40's, if ever.\n\nThe grand marriage is a symbol of social status on the Comoros islands. The completion of an ''ada'' marriage also greatly increases a man's standing in the Comoran hierarchy. A Comoran man can only wear certain elements of the national dress or stand in the first line at the mosque if he has had a grand marriage. Also, one is not fully considered a man until he has had an ''ada'' marriage.\n\nThe continuation of the grand marriage tradition is criticized because of its great expense and Comoros's intense poverty.\n<ref name=\"Two Marriage Forms in the Comoro Islands: An Investigation\">[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1298706914] {{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Kinship and social structure ===\n[[File:JOUR DE L'A\u00cfDE DHUL HAJJ BANGOI-KOUNI.jpg|thumb|Comorians]]\nComorian society has a [[bilateral descent]] system. Lineage membership and inheritance of immovable goods (land, housing) is matrilineal, passed in the maternal line, similar to many [[Bantu peoples]] who are also matrilineal, while other goods and patronymics are passed in the male line. However, there are differences between the islands, the matrilineal element being stronger on Ngazidja. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Further|Music of the Comoro Islands}}\n\n[[Zanzibar]]'s [[taarab]] music remains the most influential genre on the islands. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Further|Media of the Comoros}}\n\nThere is a government-owned national [[newspaper]] in Comoros, ''[[Al-Watwan]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alwatwan.net|title=Accueil \u2013 Al-watwan, Quotidien comorien|website=Alwatwan.net|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> published in [[Moroni, Comoros|Moroni]].

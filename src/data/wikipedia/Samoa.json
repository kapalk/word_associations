Scientific research is ongoing, although a number of different theories exist; including one proposing that the Samoans originated from [[Austronesian]] predecessors during the terminal eastward Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia and [[Melanesia]] between 2,500 and 1,500 [[BCE]].<ref>The Political Economy of Ancient Samoa: Basalt Adze Production and Linkages to Social Status\u201d (Winterhoff 2007)</ref>\n\nIntimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained between Samoa, Fiji, and Tonga, and the archaeological record supports oral tradition and native genealogies that indicate inter-island voyaging and intermarriage between pre-colonial Samoans, Fijians, and Tongans. Notable figures in Samoan history included the [[Tui Manu'a]] line and Queen [[Salamasina]] (15th century). [[Nafanua]] was a famous woman warrior who was deified in ancient Samoan religion.\n[[File:3 Samoan girls making ava 1909.jpg|right|thumb|Studio photo depicting preparation of the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] c. 1911.]]\n[[File:Urville-Apia-public.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of Samoan house, Apia, Urville 1842.]]\n\nContact with Europeans began in the early 18th century. [[Jacob Roggeveen]], a Dutchman, was the first known European to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by French explorer [[Louis-Antoine de Bougainville]], who named them the ''Navigator Islands'' in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s, which is when English [[missionaries]] and traders began arriving.\n\n=== Samoa in the 1800s ===\n\nVisits by American trading and [[whaling]] vessels were important in the early economic development of Samoa. The [[Salem, Connecticut|Salem]] brig ''Roscoe'' (Captain Benjamin Vanderford), in October 1821, was the first American trading vessel known to have called, and the ''Maro'' (Captain Richard Macy) of [[Nantucket]], in 1824, was the first recorded United States whaler at Samoa.<ref>Rhys Richards, ''Samoa\u2019s forgotten whaling heritage; American whaling in Samoan waters 1824-1878'', (1992) Wellington, Lithographic Services, pp.18-20.</ref> The whalers came for fresh drinking water, firewood and provisions, and later, they recruited local men to serve as crewmen on their ships.\n\nChristian missionary work in Samoa began in 1830 when [[John Williams (missionary)|John Williams]] of the [[London Missionary Society]] arrived in [[Sapapali'i]] from the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tahiti]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Watson | first = R.M. | title = History of Samoa: THE ADVENT OF THE MISSIONARY.

The United States laid its own claim, based on commercial shipping interests in Pearl River in Hawaii and Pago Pago Bay in Eastern Samoa, and forced alliances, most conspicuously on the islands of [[Tutuila]] and [[Manu'a]] which became American Samoa.\n\nBritain also sent troops to protect British business enterprise, harbour rights, and consulate office. This was followed by an [[Samoan Civil War|eight-year civil war]], during which each of the three powers supplied arms, training and in some cases combat troops to the warring Samoan parties. The [[Samoan crisis]] came to a critical juncture in March 1889 when all three colonial contenders sent warships into Apia harbour, and a larger-scale war seemed imminent. A massive storm on 15 March 1889 damaged or destroyed the warships, ending the military conflict.<ref>{{cite book |author=Stevenson, Robert Louis |title=A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa|year=1892|publisher=BiblioBazaar |isbn=978-1-4264-0754-3|title-link=A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Second Samoan Civil War]] reached a head in 1898 when [[German Empire|Germany]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], and the United States were locked in dispute over who should control the [[Samoa Islands]]. The [[Siege of Apia]] occurred in March 1899. Samoan forces loyal to Prince [[Malietoa Tanumafili I|Tanu]] were besieged by a larger force of Samoan rebels loyal to [[Mata'afa Iosefo]]. Supporting Prince Tanu were landing parties from four British and American warships. After several days of fighting, the Samoan rebels were finally defeated.<ref>Mains, P.

The western islands, by far the greater landmass, became [[German Samoa]].

In 1908, when the non-violent [[Mau movement|Mau a Pule]] resistance movement arose, Solf did not hesitate to banish the Mau leader [[Lauaki Namulauulu Mamoe|Lauaki Namulau'ulu Mamoe]] to Saipan in the German [[Northern Mariana Islands]].<ref>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/pacific/wsamoa18991918.html World History at KMLA], zum.de</ref>\n\nThe German colonial administration governed on the principle that \"there was only one government in the islands.\"<ref>Lewthwaite, Gordon R. \u201cLife, Land and Agriculture to Mid-Century,\u201d in ''Western Samoa''.

German merchants and settlers were active in introducing large scale [[plantation]] operations and developing new industries, notably, cocoa bean and rubber, relying on imported labourers from China and [[Melanesia]]. When the value of natural rubber fell drastically, about the end of the Great War (World War I), the New Zealand government encouraged the production of bananas, for which there is a large market in New Zealand. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nBecause of variations in altitude, a large range of tropical and subtropical crops can be cultivated, but land is not generally available to outside interests. Of the total land area of 2,934&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (725,000 acres), about 24.4% is in permanent crops and another 21.2% is arable. About 4.4% is Western Samoan Trust Estates Corporation (WSTEC). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe staple products of Samoa are copra (dried coconut meat), [[cocoa bean]] (for chocolate), and bananas. The annual production of both bananas and copra has been in the range of 13,000 to 15,000 metric tons (about 14,500 to 16,500 short tons). If the [[rhinoceros beetle]] in Samoa were eradicated, Samoa could produce in excess of 40,000 metric tons (44,000 short tons) of copra. Samoan cocoa beans are of very high quality and used in fine New Zealand chocolates. Most are [[Criollo (cocoa bean)|Criollo]]-Forastero hybrids. Coffee grows well, but production has been uneven. WSTEC is the biggest coffee producer. Rubber has been produced in Samoa for many years, but its export value has little impact on the economy. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nOther agricultural industries have been less successful. [[Sugarcane]] production, originally established by Germans in the early 20th century, could be successful. Old train tracks for transporting cane can be seen at some plantations east of [[Apia]].

Despite centuries of European influence, Samoa maintains its historical customs, social and political systems, and [[Samoan language|language]]. Cultural customs such as the [[Samoa 'ava ceremony]] are significant and solemn rituals at important occasions including the bestowal of ''[[fa'amatai|matai]]'' chiefly titles. Items of great cultural value include the finely woven ''[['ie toga]]''.\n\n[[Samoan mythology]] includes many gods with creation stories and figures of legend such as [[Tagaloa]] and the goddess of war [[Nafanua]], the daughter of [[Saveasi'uleo]], ruler of the spirit realm [[Pulotu]]. Other legends include the well known story of [[Sina and the Eel]] which explains the origins of the first coconut tree.\n\nSome Samoans are spiritual and religious, and have subtly adapted the dominant religion of Christianity to 'fit in' with fa'a Samoa and vice versa. Ancient beliefs continue to co-exist side-by-side with Christianity, particularly in regard to the traditional customs and rituals of fa'a Samoa. The Samoan culture is centred around the principle of v\u0101fealoa'i, the relationships between people. These relationships are based on respect, or [[fa'aaloalo]]. When Christianity was introduced in Samoa, most Samoan people converted. Currently 98% of the population identify themselves as Christian.\n\nSome Samoans live a communal way of life, participating in activities collectively. Examples of this are the traditional Samoan ''[[Architecture of Samoa|fale]]'' (houses) which are open with no walls, using blinds made of coconut palm fronds during the night or bad weather.\n\nThe Samoan ''[[siva Samoa|siva]]'' dance has unique gentle movements of the body in time to music and tells a story, although the Samoan male dances can be more snappy.<ref>{{cite news | title=Dance: Siva | url =http://www.samoa.co.uk/dance.html | work =Samoa.co.uk}}</ref> The ''[[sasa (dance)|sasa]]'' is also a traditional dance where rows of dancers perform rapid [[synchronization|synchronised]] movements in time to the rhythm of wooden drums ''([[pate (musical instrument)|pate]])'' or rolled mats. Another dance performed by males is called the ''[[fa'ataupati]]'' or the slap dance, creating rhythmic sounds by slapping different parts of the body. This is believed to have been derived from slapping insects on the body.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe form and construction of traditional [[architecture of Samoa]] was a specialised skill by ''Tufuga fai fale'' that was also linked to other cultural artforms.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Catholic church in Samoa-2.jpg|Roman Catholic [[Immaculate Conception]] of Mary cathedral.\nFile:Siva Afi - Fire spinning.jpg|A Samoan fire dancer.\nFile:Fale on Manono Island.jpg|A [[Architecture of Samoa|fale]] on [[Manono Island]]\nFile:Apia Samoa Temple-new.jpg|LDS [[Apia Samoa Temple]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Tattooing===\n\n[[File:Samoan Malu.jpg|thumb|A Samoan woman with a traditional [[malu]].]]\n\nAs with other Polynesian cultures ([[Hawaiian culture|Hawaiian]], [[Tahitians|Tahitian]] and [[M\u0101ori culture|M\u0101ori]]) with significant and unique tattoos, Samoans have two gender specific and culturally significant tattoos. For males, it is called the [[Pe'a]] and consists of intricate and geometrical patterns [[tattoo]]ed that cover areas from the knees up towards the ribs. A male who possesses such a tatau is called a [[soga'imiti]].

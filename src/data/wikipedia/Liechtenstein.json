Retrieved 27 June 2009</ref> [[Neolithic]] farming settlements were initially founded in the valleys around 5300 BCE.\n\nThe [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and [[La T\u00e8ne culture]]s flourished during the late [[Iron Age]], from around 450 BCE\u2014possibly under some influence of both the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] civilisations. One of the most important tribal groups in the Alpine region were the [[Helvetii]]. In 58 BCE, at the [[Battle of Bibracte]], [[Julius Caesar]] defeated the Alpine tribes, therefore bringing the region under close control of the [[Roman Republic]]. By 15 BCE, [[Tiberius]]\u2014destined to be the second Roman emperor\u2014with his brother, [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]], conquered the entirety of the Alpine area. Liechtenstein was then integrated into the [[Roman province]] of [[Raetia]]. The area was maintained by the Roman military, who also maintained large legionary camps at [[Bregenz|Brigantium]] (Austria), near [[Lake Constance]], and at [[Maienfeld|Magia]] (Swiss). A [[Roman road]] which ran through the territory was also created and maintained by these groups. In 259/60 Brigantium was destroyed by the [[Alemanni]], a [[Germanic people]] who settled in the area in around 450 CE.\n\nIn the [[Early Middle Ages]], the Alemanni settled the eastern [[Swiss plateau]] by the 5th century and the [[valleys of the Alps]] by the end of the 8th century, with Liechtenstein located at the eastern edge of Alemannia. In the 6th century, the entire region became part of the [[Frankish Empire]] following [[Clovis I]]'s victory over the Alemanni at [[Tolbiac]] in 504.<ref name = Nationsencyclopedia>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Switzerland-HISTORY.html Switzerland history] Nationsencyclopedia.com.

It would later be reunified with [[Middle Francia]] under the [[Holy Roman Empire]], around 1000 CE.<ref name = Early/> Until about 1100, the predominant language of the area was [[Romansh language|Romansch]], but thereafter [[German language|German]] began to gain ground in the territory. In 1300, an Alemannic population\u2014the Walsers, who originated in [[Valais]]\u2014entered the region and settled. The mountain village of [[Triesenberg]] still preserves features of [[Walser German|Walser dialect]] into the present century.<ref>P. Christiaan Klieger, ''The Microstates of Europe: Designer Nations in a Post-Modern World'' (2014), p. 41</ref>\n\n===Foundation of a dynasty===\nBy 1200, dominions across the Alpine plateau were controlled by the Houses of [[House of Savoy|Savoy]], [[Z\u00e4hringer]], [[Habsburg]], and [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. Other regions were accorded the [[Imperial immediacy]] that granted the empire direct control over the mountain passes. When the Kyburg dynasty fell in 1264, the Habsburgs under [[Rudolph I of Habsburg|King Rudolph I]] (Holy Roman Emperor in 1273) extended their territory to the eastern Alpine plateau that included the territory of Liechtenstein.<ref name = Nationsencyclopedia/> This region was [[Feoffment|enfeoffed]] to the [[Hohenems|Counts of Hohenems]] until the sale to the [[Liechtenstein dynasty]] in 1699.\n\nIn 1396 Vaduz (the southern region of Liechtenstein) gained [[imperial immediacy]], i.e. it became subject to the Holy Roman Emperor alone.<ref name=\"Eccardt 2005 176\">{{cite book|last=Eccardt|first=Thomas|date=2005|title=Secrets of the Seven Smallest States of Europe|isbn=978-0-7818-1032-6|publisher=Hippocrene Books|pages=176}}</ref>\n\nThe family, from which the principality takes its name, originally came from [[Liechtenstein Castle]] in Lower Austria which they had possessed from at least 1140 until the 13th century (and again from 1807 onwards). The Liechtensteins acquired land, predominantly in [[Moravia]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Silesia]], and [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]]. As these territories were all held in [[Fee (feudal tenure)|feudal tenure]] from more senior feudal lords, particularly various branches of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]], the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement to qualify for a seat in the Imperial diet ([[parliament]]), the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|''Reichstag'']]. Even though several Liechtenstein princes served several Habsburg rulers as close advisers, without any territory held directly from the Imperial throne, they held little power in the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nFor this reason, the family sought to acquire lands that would be classed as ''unmittelbar'' (immediate) or held without any intermediate feudal tenure, directly from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. During the early 17th century [[Karl I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Karl I of Liechtenstein]] was made a ''F\u00fcrst'' (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] after siding with him in a political battle. [[Hans-Adam I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Hans-Adam I]] was allowed to purchase the minuscule ''Herrschaft'' (\"Lordship\") of [[Schellenberg]] and county of [[Vaduz]] (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their [[count|comital]] sovereign and the [[Suzerainty|suzerain]] Emperor.\n\n===Principality===\n\nOn 23 January 1719,<ref>{{cite web |title=300 years Principality of Liechtenstein \u2013 F\u00fcrstentum Liechtenstein |url=https://www.liechtenstein.li/en/country-and-people/300-years-principality-of-liechtenstein// |website=www.liechtenstein.li}}</ref> after the lands had been purchased, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], decreed that Vaduz and Schellenberg were united and elevated the newly formed territory to the dignity of ''F\u00fcrstentum'' (''[[principality]]'') with the name \"Liechtenstein\" in honour of \"[his] true servant, [[Anton Florian, Prince of Liechtenstein|Anton Florian of Liechtenstein]]\". It was on this date that Liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It is a testament to the pure political expediency of the purchase that the Princes of Liechtenstein never visited their new principality for almost 100 years.\n\nBy the early 19th century, as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in Europe, the Holy Roman Empire came under the effective control of France, following the crushing defeat at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] by [[Napoleon]] in 1805. Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]] abdicated, ending more than 960 years of feudal government. Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]]. This political restructuring had broad consequences for Liechtenstein: the historical imperial, legal, and political institutions had been dissolved. The state ceased to owe an obligation to any feudal lord beyond its borders.<ref>{{cite web|title=History, creation of Liechtenstein|url=https://www.liechtenstein.li/en/country-and-people/history/creation-of-liechtenstein/|website=liechtenstein.li|publisher=Liechtenstein Marketing|accessdate=1 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nModern publications generally attribute Liechtenstein's sovereignty to these events. Its prince ceased to owe an obligation to any [[Suzerainty|suzerain]]. From 25 July 1806, when the [[Confederation of the Rhine]] was founded, the Prince of Liechtenstein was a member, in fact, a vassal, of its hegemon, styled ''protector'', the French Emperor Napoleon I, until the dissolution of the confederation on 19 October 1813.\n\nSoon afterward, Liechtenstein joined the [[German Confederation]] (20 June 1815{{spaced ndash}}24 August 1866), which was presided over by the [[Emperor of Austria]].\n\nIn 1818, [[Johann I Joseph, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Johann I]] granted the territory a limited constitution. In that same year [[Aloys II, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Aloys]] became the first member of the House of Liechtenstein to set foot in the principality that bore their name. The next visit would not occur until 1842.\n\nDevelopments during the 19th century included:\n* 1836, the first factory, for making ceramics, was opened.\n* 1861, the Savings and Loans Bank was founded along with the first cotton-weaving mill.\n* 1868, the Liechtenstein Army was disbanded for financial reasons.\n* 1872, a railway line between Switzerland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire was constructed through Liechtenstein.\n* 1886, two bridges over the Rhine to Switzerland were built.\n\n===20th century===\nUntil the end of [[World War I]], Liechtenstein was closely tied first to the [[Austrian Empire]] and later to [[Austria-Hungary]]; the ruling princes continued to derive much of their wealth from estates in the Habsburg territories, and spent much of their time at their two palaces in Vienna. The economic devastation caused by the war forced the country to conclude a [[customs union|customs]] and [[monetary union]] with its other neighbour, Switzerland.\n\nAt the time of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was argued that Liechtenstein, as a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, was no longer bound to the emerging independent state of [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], since the latter did not consider itself the legal successor to the empire. This is partly contradicted{{Original research inline|date=June 2016}} by the Liechtenstein perception that the dethroned Austro-Hungarian Emperor still maintained an abstract heritage of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n[[File:Franz I von Liechtenstein.jpg|thumb|[[Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein]] from 1929 to 1938]]\n\nIn 1929, 75-year-old [[Franz I, Prince of Liechtenstein|Prince Franz I]] succeeded to the throne.

At the close of the conflict, [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]], acting to seize what they considered German possessions, expropriated the entirety of the Liechtenstein dynasty's properties in those three regions. The expropriations (subject to [[Foreign relations of Liechtenstein#International dispute with the Czech Republic and Slovakia|modern legal dispute]] at the [[International Court of Justice]]) included over {{convert|1600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} of agricultural and forest land (most notably the UNESCO listed [[Lednice\u2013Valtice Cultural Landscape]]), and several family castles and palaces.\n\nIn 2005 it was revealed that Jewish labourers from the [[Strasshof an der Nordbahn|Strasshof]] [[concentration camp]], provided by the ''[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]'', had worked on estates in Austria owned by Liechtenstein's Princely House.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4443809.stm |title=Nazi crimes taint Liechtenstein |work=BBC News |date=14 April 2005 |accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nCitizens of Liechtenstein were forbidden to enter Czechoslovakia during the [[Cold War]].

Liechtenstein is the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|sixth-smallest]] independent nation in the world by area.\n\nThe principality of Liechtenstein is [[Municipalities of Liechtenstein|divided into 11 communes]] called ''Gemeinden'' (singular ''Gemeinde''). The ''Gemeinden'' mostly consist of only a single town or village. Five of them ([[Eschen]], [[Gamprin]], [[Mauren]], [[Ruggell]], and [[Schellenberg]]) fall within the electoral district ''Unterland'' (the lower county), and the remainder ([[Balzers]], [[Planken]], [[Schaan]], [[Triesen]], [[Triesenberg]], and [[Vaduz]]) within ''Oberland'' (the upper county).\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Liechtenstein}}\n[[File:Vaduz Zentrum.jpg|thumb|Looking southward at Vaduz city centre.]]\n[[File:Hilti Schaan.jpg|thumb|Headquarter of [[Hilti]] Corporation in [[Schaan]], Liechtenstein.]]\n\nDespite its limited natural resources, Liechtenstein is one of the few countries in the world with more registered companies than citizens; it has developed a prosperous, highly industrialized free-enterprise economy and boasts a financial service sector as well as a living standard that compares favourably with those of the urban areas of Liechtenstein's much larger European neighbours.\n\nLiechtenstein participates in a [[customs union]] with Switzerland and employs the [[Swiss franc]] as the national currency. The country imports about 85% of its energy. Liechtenstein has been a member of the [[European Economic Area]] (an organization serving as a bridge between the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) and the [[European Union]]) since May 1995.\n\nThe government is working to harmonize its economic policies with those of an integrated Europe. In 2008, the unemployment rate stood at 1.5%. Liechtenstein has only one hospital, the Liechtensteinisches Landesspital in Vaduz. As of 2014 the [[CIA World Factbook]] estimated the [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) on a [[purchasing power parity]] basis to be $4.978 billion. As of 2009 the estimate per capita was $139,100, the highest listed for the world.<ref name=\"LiechCIA\"/>\n\nIndustries include electronics, textiles, precision instruments, metal manufacturing, power tools, anchor bolts, calculators, pharmaceuticals, and food products. Its most recognizable international company and largest employer is [[Hilti]], a manufacturer of [[Nail gun|direct fastening systems]] and other high-end power tools. Many cultivated fields and small farms are found both in the Oberland and Unterland. Liechtenstein produces wheat, barley, corn, potatoes, dairy products, livestock, and [[Liechtenstein wine|wine]]. Tourism accounts for a large portion of its economy.\n\n===Taxation===\n[[File:Grenze Liechtenstein, Balzers.jpg|thumb|left|Since 1923, there has been no [[border control]] between Liechtenstein and [[Switzerland]].]]\n\nThe government of Liechtenstein taxes personal income, business income, and principal (wealth). The basic rate of [[Income tax#Personal|personal income tax]] is 1.2%. When combined with the additional income tax imposed by the communes, the combined income tax rate is 17.82%.<ref>[http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Liechtenstein-TAXATION.html Encyclopedia of the Nations].

This rate is higher for the self-employed, up to a maximum of 11%, making the maximum income tax rate about 29% in total. The basic [[wealth tax|tax rate on wealth]] is 0.06% per annum, and the combined total rate is 0.89%. The tax rate on corporate profits is 12.5%.<ref name=LiechCIA/>\n\nLiechtenstein's [[gift tax|gift]] and [[Inheritance tax|estate taxes]] vary depending on the relationship the recipient has to the giver and the amount of the inheritance. The tax ranges between 0.5% and 0.75% for spouses and children and 18% to 27% for non-related recipients. The estate tax is progressive.\n\nLiechtenstein has previously received significant revenues from ''Stiftungen'' (\"foundations\"), financial entities created to hide the true owner of nonresident foreigners' financial holdings. The foundation is registered in the name of a Liechtensteiner, often a lawyer. This set of laws used to make Liechtenstein a popular [[tax haven]] for extremely wealthy individuals and businesses attempting to avoid or evade taxes in their home countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-02/billionaire-tax-haven-liechtenstein-loses-on-bank-reforms|title=Billionaire Tax Haven Liechtenstein Loses on Bank Reforms|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref> In recent years, Liechtenstein has displayed stronger determination to prosecute international money launderers and worked to promote an image as a legitimate finance center.

The \"Historical Society of the Principality of Liechtenstein\" plays a role in preserving the culture and history of the country.\n\nThe largest museum is the [[Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein]], an international museum of modern and contemporary art with an important international art collection. The building by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo, and Kerez is a landmark in Vaduz. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a \"black box\" of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein.\n\nThe other important museum is the [[Liechtenstein National Museum]] (''Liechtensteinisches Landesmuseum'') showing permanent exhibition on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There is also a stamp museum, ski museum, and a 500-year-old Rural Lifestyle Museum.\n\nThe [[Liechtenstein State Library]] is the library that has [[legal deposit]] for all books published in the country.\n\nThe most famous historical sites are [[Vaduz Castle]], [[Gutenberg Castle]], the Red House and the ruins of Schellenberg.\n\nThe Private Art Collection of the Prince of Liechtenstein, one of the world's leading private art collections, is shown at the [[Liechtenstein Museum]] in [[Vienna]].\n\nOn the country's national holiday all subjects are invited to the castle of the head of state. A significant portion of the population attends the national celebration at the castle where speeches are made and complimentary beer is served.<ref name=Letzing>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/liechtenstein-gets-even-smaller-1397700444 |title=Liechtenstein Gets Even Smaller\n |last=Letzing |first=John |date=16 April 2014 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=21 June 2018 }}</ref>\n\nMusic and theatre are an important part of the culture. There are numerous music organizations such as the Liechtenstein Musical Company, the annual Guitar Days, and the International Josef Gabriel Rheinberger Society, which play in two main theatres.\n\n==Media==\nThe primary [[internet service provider]] and [[mobile network operator]] of Liechtenstein is Telecom Liechtenstein, located in Schaan. There is only one television channel in the country, the private channel [[1FLTV]] created in 2008. At the moment, 1FLTV is not a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]]. L-Radio, which was established in 2004, serves as Liechtenstein's radio station and is based in Triesen. L-Radio has a listener base of 50,000 and began as \"air Radio Liechtenstein\" on 15 October 1938. Liechtenstein also has two major [[newspaper]]s; ''[[Liechtensteiner Volksblatt]]'' and ''[[Liechtensteiner Vaterland]]''. The primary [[multimedia]] company in Liechtenstein is [[ManaMedia]], located in Vaduz.\n\n[[Amateur radio]] is a hobby of some nationals and visitors. However, unlike virtually every other sovereign nation, Liechtenstein does not have its own [[ITU prefix]]. It uses Switzerland's callsign prefixes (typically \"HB\") followed by a zero.\n\n==Sports==\n{{See also|Rugby union in Liechtenstein}}\n[[File:Marco B\u00fcchel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Marco B\u00fcchel]], the first Liechtensteiner alpine skier to compete at six [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]]]]\nLiechtenstein [[Association football|football]] teams play in the Swiss football leagues. The [[Liechtenstein Football Cup]] allows access for one Liechtenstein team each year to the [[UEFA Europa League]]; [[FC Vaduz]], a team playing in the [[Swiss Challenge League]], the second division in Swiss football, is the most successful team in the Cup, and scored their greatest success in the [[1996\u201397 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup in 1996]] when they drew with and defeated the [[Latvia]]n team [[FK Jelgava|FC Universitate Riga]] by 1\u20131 and 4\u20132, to go on to a lucrative fixture against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.]], which they lost 0\u20133 and 0\u20134.\n\nThe [[Liechtenstein national football team]] is regarded as an easy target for any team drawn against them; this was the basis for a book about Liechtenstein's unsuccessful qualifying campaign for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] by British author, [[Charlie Connelly]]. In one surprising week during autumn 2004, however, the team managed a 2\u20132 draw with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], who only a few months earlier had been the losing finalists in the [[UEFA Euro 2004|European Championships]]. Four days later, the Liechtenstein team traveled to Luxembourg, where they defeated [[Luxembourg national football team|the home team]] 4\u20130 in a [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] qualifying match. In the qualification stage of the European Championship 2008, Liechtenstein beat Latvia 1\u20130, a result which prompted the resignation of the Latvian coach. They went on to beat Iceland 3\u20130 on 17 October 2007, which is considered one of the most dramatic losses of the Icelandic national football team. On 7 September 2010, they came within seconds of a 1\u20131 draw against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in Glasgow, having led 1\u20130 earlier in the second half, but Liechtenstein lost 2\u20131 thanks to a goal by [[Stephen McManus]] in the 97th minute. On 3 June 2011, Liechtenstein defeated [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]] 2\u20130. On 15 November 2014, Liechtenstein defeated [[Moldova national football team|Moldova]] 0\u20131 with [[Franz Burgmeier]]'s late free kick goal in [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]].\n\nAs an [[Alps|alpine]] country, the main sporting opportunity for Liechtensteiners to excel is in winter sports such as [[Downhill (ski competition)|downhill skiing]]: the country's single ski area is [[Malbun]]. [[Hanni Wenzel]] won two gold medals and one silver medal in the 1980 [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]] (she won bronze in 1976), her brother [[Andreas Wenzel|Andreas]] won one silver medal in 1980 and one bronze medal in 1984 in the [[Giant slalom skiing|giant slalom]] event, and her daughter [[Tina Weirather]] won a bronze medal in 2018 in the [[Super-G]]. With ten medals overall (all in alpine skiing), Liechtenstein has won more Olympic medals per capita than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Per Capita Olympic Medal Table|url=http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/reloly.html|accessdate=24 January 2009}}</ref> It is the smallest nation to win a medal in any Olympics, Winter or Summer, and the only nation to win a medal in the Winter Games but not in the Summer Games. Other notable skiers from Liechtenstein are [[Marco B\u00fcchel]], [[Willi Frommelt]], [[Paul Frommelt]] and [[Ursula Konzett]]. Liechtenstein is also the home country of [[Stephanie Vogt]], a professional women's [[tennis]] player.\n\n===Youth===\n[[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]] competes in the Switzerland U16 Cup Tournament, which offers young players an opportunity to play against top football clubs.\n\n==Security and defence==\nThe [[Law enforcement in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein National Police]] is responsible for keeping order within the country. It consists of 87 field officers and 38 civilian staff, totaling 125 employees. All officers are equipped with [[small arms]]. The country has one of the world's lowest [[Crime statistics|crime rate]]s. Liechtenstein's prison holds few, if any, inmates, and those with sentences over two years are transferred to Austrian jurisdiction. The Liechtenstein National Police maintains a trilateral treaty with Austria and Switzerland that enables close cross-border cooperation among the police forces of the three countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/pdf-fl-staat-aussenpolitik-finanzplatz-facts_and_figures_engl.pdf |title=''Liechtenstein \u2013 facts and figures'' |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107214519/http://www.liechtenstein.li/en/pdf-fl-staat-aussenpolitik-finanzplatz-facts_and_figures_engl.pdf |archivedate=7 January 2006 }}. Office for Foreign Affairs of Liechtenstein</ref>\n\nLiechtenstein follows a policy of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] and is one of the few [[List of countries without armed forces|countries in the world that maintain no military]]. The army was abolished soon after the [[Austro-Prussian War of 1866]], in which Liechtenstein fielded an army of 80 men, although they were not involved in any fighting. The demise of the [[German Confederation]] in that war freed Liechtenstein from its international obligation to maintain an army, and parliament seized this opportunity and refused to provide funding for one. The Prince objected, as such a move would leave the country defenceless, but relented on 12 February 1868 and disbanded the force. The last soldier to serve under the colors of Liechtenstein died in 1939 at age 95.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Beattie|first=David|title=Liechtenstein: A Modern History|location=London|publisher=[[I.B.

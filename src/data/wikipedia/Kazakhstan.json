The capital is [[Astana]] (officially renamed Nur-Sultan in 2019), where it was moved in 1997 from [[Almaty]], the country's largest city.\n\nThe territory of Kazakhstan has historically been inhabited by [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[nomads]] who trace their ancestry to many [[List of Turkic dynasties and countries|Turkic states]] such as [[Turkic Khaganate]] etc. In the 13th century, the territory joined the [[Mongolian Empire]] under [[Genghis Khan]]. By the 16th century, the [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] emerged as a distinct group, divided into three ''[[j\u00fcz]]'' (ancestor branches occupying specific territories). The [[Russians]] began advancing into the [[Kazakh steppe]] in the 18th century, and by the mid-19th century, they nominally ruled all of Kazakhstan as part of the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the [[1917 Russian Revolution]], and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], the territory of Kazakhstan was reorganised several times.

While ancient cities [[Taraz]] (Aulie-Ata) and [[Hazrat-e Turkestan]] had long served as important way-stations along the [[Silk Road]] connecting Asia and Europe, true political consolidation began only with the Mongol rule of the early 13th century. Under the [[Mongol Empire]], the largest in world history, administrative districts were established. These eventually came under the rule of the emergent [[Kazakh Khanate]] (Kazakhstan).\n\nThroughout this period, traditional [[nomad]]ic life and a [[livestock]]-based economy continued to dominate the [[steppe]]. In the 15th century, a distinct [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] identity began to emerge among the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes, a process which was consolidated by the mid-16th century with the appearance of the [[Kazakh language]], culture, and economy.\n\nNevertheless, the region was the focus of ever-increasing disputes between the native Kazakh [[emir]]s and the neighbouring [[Persian-speaking peoples]] to the south. At its height, the Khanate would rule parts of Central Asia and control [[Cumania]]. By the early 17th century, the Kazakh Khanate was struggling with the impact of tribal rivalries, which had effectively divided the population into the Great, Middle and Little (or Small) hordes (''[[j\u00fcz]]''). Political disunion, tribal rivalries, and the diminishing importance of overland trade routes between East and West weakened the Kazakh Khanate. [[Khiva Khanate]] used this opportunity and annexed [[Mangyshlak Peninsula]]. Uzbek rule there lasted two centuries until the Russian arrival.\n\nDuring the 17th century, the Kazakhs fought [[Oirats]], a federation of western [[Mongol]] tribes, including the [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Kazakhstan/Cultural-life#toc73648 |title=Kazakhstan to c.

The \"[[Great Game]]\" period is generally regarded as running from approximately 1813 to the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907]]. The [[tsar]]s effectively ruled over most of the territory belonging to what is now the Republic of Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Russian Empire introduced a system of administration and built military garrisons and barracks in its effort to establish a presence in Central Asia in the so-called \"Great Game\" for dominance in the area against the [[British Empire]], which was extending its influence from the south in India and Southeast Asia. Russia built its first outpost, [[Orsk]], in 1735. Russia introduced the Russian language in all schools and governmental organisations.\n\nRussian efforts to impose its system aroused the resentment by the [[Kazakh people]], and, by the 1860s, some Kazakhs resisted Russia's rule. It had disrupted the traditional nomadic lifestyle and livestock-based economy, and people were suffering from hunger and starvation, with some Kazakh tribes being decimated. The Kazakh national movement, which began in the late 19th century, sought to preserve the native language and identity by resisting the attempts of the Russian Empire to assimilate and stifle them.\n\nFrom the 1890s onward, ever-larger numbers of settlers from the Russian Empire began [[colonising]] the territory of present-day Kazakhstan, in particular the province of [[Semirechye]]. The number of settlers rose still further once the [[Trans-Aral Railway]] from [[Orenburg]] to [[Tashkent]] was completed in 1906. A specially created Migration Department (\u041f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0423\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) in [[St. Petersburg]] oversaw and encouraged the migration to expand Russian influence in the area.

After several years of rapid expansion in the mid-2000s, the banking industry collapsed in 2008. Several large banking groups, including [[BTA Bank]] J.S.C. and Alliance Bank, defaulted soon after. Since then, the industry has shrunk and been restructured, with system-wide loans dropping to 39% of GDP in 2011 from 59% in 2007. Although the Russian and Kazakhstani banking systems share several common features, there are also some fundamental differences. Banks in Kazakhstan have experienced a lengthy period of political stability and economic growth. Together with a rational approach to banking and finance policy, this has helped push Kazakhstan's banking system to a higher level of development. Banking technology and personnel qualifications alike are stronger in Kazakhstan than in Russia. On the negative side, past stability in Kazakhstan arose from the concentration of virtually all political power in the hands of a single individual \u2013 the key factor in any assessment of system or country risk. The potential is there for serious disturbances if and when authority passes into new hands.<ref>{{cite news |title=S&P Maintains Kazakhstan BICRA at Group \"8\"

By 2013, this ratio stood at 0.18% of GDP. It will be difficult to reach the target as long as economic growth remains strong.

Some 11% of the total was spent on research and development. This compares with about 40\u201370% of innovation expenditure in developed countries. This augmentation was due to a sharp rise in product design and the introduction of new services and production methods over this period, to the detriment of the acquisition of machinery and equipment, which has traditionally made up the bulk of Kazakhstan's innovation expenditure. Training costs represented just 2% of innovation expenditure, a much lower share than in developed countries.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn December 2012, President&nbsp;[[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]&nbsp;announced the&nbsp;''[[Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy]]''&nbsp;with the slogan \"Strong Business, Strong State.\" This pragmatic strategy proposes sweeping socio-economic and political reforms to hoist Kazakhstan among the top 30 economies by 2050. In this document, Kazakhstan gives itself 15 years to evolve into a knowledge economy. New sectors are to be created during each five-year plan. The first of these, covering the years 2010\u20132014, focused on developing industrial capacity in car manufacturing, aircraft engineering and the production of locomotives, passenger and cargo railroad cars. During the second five-year plan to 2019, the goal is to develop export markets for these products. To enable Kazakhstan to enter the world market of geological exploration, the country intends to increase the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors such as oil and gas. It also intends to develop rare earth metals, given their importance for electronics, laser technology, communication and medical equipment. The second five-year plan coincides with the development of the ''Business 2020'' roadmap for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which makes provision for the allocation of grants to SMEs in the regions and for microcredit.

Low-return, water-intensive crop varieties will be replaced with vegetable, oil and fodder products.

Since at least the 17th century, Kazakh bards could be divided in two main categories: the zh\u0131raws (zhiraus, \u017eyraus), who passed on the works of others, usually not creating and adding their own original work; and the [[aqyn]]s (akyns), who improvised or created their own poems, stories or songs.<ref name=\"Feldman\" /> There were several types of works, such as [[didactic]] ''termes'', [[elegiac]] ''tolgaws'', and [[epic (genre)|epic]] ''zh\u0131rs''.<ref name=\"Feldman\" /> Although the origins of such tales are often unknown, most of them were associated with bards of the recent or more distant past, who supposedly created them or passed them on, by the time most Kazakh poetry and prose was first written down in the second half of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Feldman\" /> There are clear stylistic differences between works first created in the 19th century, and works dating from earlier periods but not documented before the 19th century, such as those attributed to such 16th- and 17th-century bards as Er Shoban and Dosmombet Zh\u0131raw (also known as Dospambet \u017dyrau; he appeared to have been literate, and reportedly visited [[Constantinople]]), and even to such 15th-century bards as Shalkiz and Asan Qaygh\u0131.<ref name=\"Feldman\" />\n\nOther notable bards include Kaztugan \u017dyrau, \u017diembet \u017dyrau, Axtamberdy \u017dyrau, and Buxar \u017dyrau Kalkamanuly, who was an advisor to [[Ablai Khan]], and whose works have been preserved by M\u00e4\u0161h\u00fcr \u017d\u00fcsip K\u00f6peev.<ref name=\"Nurmanova\" /> ''Er Targh\u0131n'' and ''[[Alpamysh|Alpam\u0131s]]'' are two of the most famous examples of Kazakh literature to be recorded in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Feldman\" /> The ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'' and Oguz Name (a story of ancient Turkic king [[Oghuz Khan]]) are the most well-known Turkic heroic legends.

The literary magazines ''[[Ay Qap]]'' (published between 1911 and 1915 in Arabic script) and ''Qazaq'' (published between 1913 and 1918) played an important role in the development of the intellectual and political life among early 20th-century Kazakhs.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Kazakhstan}}\n[[File:Stamp of Kazakhstan 659.jpg|thumb|[[Nowruz]] on stamp of Kazakhstan]]\nThe modern state of Kazakhstan is home to the Kazakh State Kurmangazy Orchestra of Folk Instruments, the Kazakh State Philharmonic Orchestra, the Kazakh National Opera and the Kazakh State Chamber Orchestra. The folk instrument orchestra was named after [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly]], a famous composer and dombra player from the 19th century. The Musical-Dramatic Training College, founded in 1931, was the first institute of higher education for music. Two years later, the Orchestra of Kazakh Folk Musical Instruments was formed [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html].\nThe Foundation Asyl Mura is archivating and publishing historical recordings of great samples of Kazakh music both traditional and classical.\nThe leading Conservatoire is in Almaty, the Qurmanghazy Conservatoire. It currently competes with the national conservatoire in Astana, Kazakhstans capital.\n\nWhen referring to traditional Kazakh music, authentic folklore must be separated from \"folklorism\". The latter denotes music executed by academically trained performers who aim at preserving the traditional music for coming generations. As far as can be reconstructed, the music of Kazakhstan from the period before a strong Russian influence consists of Instrumental music and Vocal music. Instrumental music, with the pieces (\"K\u00fcy\") being performed by soloists. Text is often seen in the background (or \"program\") for the music, as a lot of K\u00fcy titles refer to stories. Vocal music, either as part of a ceremony such as a wedding (mainly performed by women), or as part of a feast. Here we might divide into subgenres: epic singing, containing not only historical facts, but as well the tribe's genealogy, love songs, didactic verses; and as a special form the composition of two or more singers in public (Aitys), of dialogue character and usually unexpectedly frankly in content.\n\n[[File:\u0414\u0430\u043d\u044d\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0422\u0443\u043b\u0435\u0448\u043e\u0432\u0430 (\u0434\u0435\u043d\u044c 1) \u043d\u0430 \u0414\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u0432\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0435 2015.jpg|thumb|{{Esccnty|Kazakhstan|Junior|y=2018#Daneliya_Tuleshova|t=Daneliya Tuleshova}} represented Kazakhstan at the [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2018]].]]\nThe Russian influence on the music life in Kazakhstan can be seen in two spheres: first, the introduction of musical academic institutions such as concert houses with opera stages, conservatories, where the European music was performed and taught, and second, by trying to incorporate Kazakh traditional music into these academic structures.\nControlled first by the [[Russian Empire]] and then the [[Soviet Union]], Kazakhstan's folk and classical traditions became connected with [[ethnic Russian music]] and Western European music. Prior to the 20th century, Kazakh folk music was collected and studied by [[ethnography|ethnographic]] research teams including [[composer]]s, [[music critic]]s and [[musicology|musicologists]]. In the first part of the 19th century, Kazakh music was transcribed in linear [[musical notation|notation]]. Some composers of this era set Kazakh folk songs to Russian-style [[European classical music]].\n\nThe Kazakhs themselves, however, did not write their own music in notation until 1931. Later, as part of the Soviet Union, Kazakh folk culture was encouraged in a sanitized manner designed to avoid political and social unrest. The result was a bland derivative of real Kazakh folk music. In 1920, [[Aleksandr Zatayevich]], a Russian official, created major works of art music with melodies and other elements of Kazakh folk music. Beginning in 1928 and accelerating in the 1930s, he also adapted traditional Kazakh instruments for use in Russian-style ensembles, such as by increasing the number of [[fret]]s and [[strings (music)|strings]]. Soon, these styles of modern orchestral playing became the only way for musicians to officially play; Kazakh folk was turned into patriotic, professional and socialist endeavors [http://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/publictn/46/touda/touda-eng.html].\n\nThe current situation could be described as the effort to rediscover the traditional music as it had been practised before the heavy influence of European musical styles. Although the quality of the performances and the striving for authenticity cannot be ignored, it is for methodological reasons important to remember that the contemporary musicians performing among traditional folk music are all well trained professionals (Rauchan Orazbaeva, Ramazan Stamgazi).\n\nAnother very challenging aspect arises from the young composers generation, and the rock and jazz musicians, as they aim to incorporate their traditional heritage into the music they learned from the western cultures, thus forming a new stage of \"ethnic contemporary classics\", respectively ethnic rock or jazz music that sounds distinctly Kazakh. For the classical sector outstanding: Aqtoty Raimkulova, [[Turan ensemble]]; for jazz: \"Magic of Nomads\"; for Rock: Roksonaki, [[Urker]], [[Ulytau]], Alda span.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Kazakh cuisine}}\n\nIn the national cuisine, livestock meat can be cooked in a variety of ways and is usually served with a wide assortment of traditional bread products. Refreshments often include black tea and traditional milk-derived drinks such as [[ayran]], [[shubat]] and [[kymyz]]. A traditional Kazakh dinner involves a multitude of appetisers on the table, followed by a soup and one or two main courses such as [[pilaf]] and [[beshbarmak]]. They also drink their national beverage, which consists of fermented mare's milk.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cuisine of Kazakhstan|url=https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/kazakhstan_cuisine.shtml|website=Oriental Express Central Asia|accessdate=17 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118053709/https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/kazakhstan_cuisine.shtml|archivedate=18 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Kazakhstan}}\n[[File:2016 Brussels Cycling Classic 032.jpg|thumb|[[Astana Pro Team]] is professional cycling team representing Kazakhstan and sponsored by the state-owned companies from Kazakhstan]]\nKazakhstan consistently performs in Olympic competitions.

The etymology of the word ''\u010cech'' can be traced back to the [[Proto-Slavic]] root ''*\u010del-'', meaning \"member of the people; kinsman\", thus making it [[cognate (linguistics)|cognate]] to the Czech word ''[[:wiktionary:\u010dlov\u011bk|\u010dlov\u011bk]]'' (a person).<ref>{{cite web|last=Spal|first=Jarom\u00edr|title=P\u016fvod jm\u00e9na \u010cech|url=http://nase-rec.ujc.cas.cz/archiv.php?art=4320|publisher=Na\u0161e \u0159e\u010d|accessdate=10 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe country has been traditionally divided into three lands, namely [[Bohemia]] (''\u010cechy'') in the west, [[Moravia]] (''Morava'') in the east, and [[Czech Silesia]] (''Slezsko''; the smaller, south-eastern part of [[Silesia|historical Silesia]], most of which is located within modern Poland) in the northeast. Known as the ''lands of the Bohemian Crown'' since the 14th century, a number of other names for the country have been used, including ''Czech/Bohemian lands'', ''Bohemian Crown'', ''Czechia'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/letter/from-bohemia-to-czechia|title=From Bohemia to Czechia - Radio Prague}}</ref> and the ''lands of the Crown of [[Saint Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Saint Wenceslas]]''. When the country regained its independence after the dissolution of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]] in 1918, the new name of ''Czechoslovakia'' was coined to reflect the union of the Czech and Slovak nations within the one country.\n\nAfter Czechoslovakia dissolved in 1992, the Czech part lacked a common English short name.

The [[Venus of Doln\u00ed V\u011bstonice]], together with a few others from nearby locations, is the oldest known [[ceramic]] article in the world.\n\nIn the [[classical era]], from the 3rd century BC [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations, the [[Boii]] gave their name to Bohemia. The Boii founded a city on the site of modern Prague, and some of its ruins are now a tourist attraction. According to a 2000 study by Semino, 35.6% of Czech males have y-chromosome haplogroup R1b,  which is common among Celts but rare among Slavs. There are claims among modern Czechs that the Czech people are as much descendants of the Boii as they are from the later Slavic invaders (as well as the historical Germanic peoples of Czech lands) Later in the 1st century, the Germanic tribes of the [[Marcomanni]] and [[Quadi]] settled there. Their king [[Maroboduus]] is the first documented ruler of Bohemia. During the [[Migration Period]] around the 5th century, many Germanic tribes moved westwards and southwards out of Central Europe. Most of the Czech rivers have Celtic or old Germanic name origin.\n\n[[Slavs]] from the [[Black Sea]]\u2013[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region settled in the area (a movement that was also stimulated by the onslaught of peoples from [[Siberia]] and Eastern Europe: [[Huns]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and [[Hungarian people|Magyars]]). In the sixth century, they moved westwards into Bohemia, Moravia and some of present-day Austria and Germany.\n\nDuring the 7th century, the Frankish merchant [[Samo]], supporting the Slavs fighting against nearby settled [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], became the ruler of the first known Slavic state in Central Europe, [[Samo's Empire]]. The principality of [[Great Moravia]], controlled by [[House of Mojmir|Moymir dynasty]], arose in the 8th century and reached its zenith in the 9th (during the reign of [[Svatopluk I of Moravia]]) when it held off the influence of the Franks. Great Moravia was Christianized, with a crucial role being played by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] mission of [[Cyril and Methodius]]. They created the artificial language [[Old Church Slavonic]], the first literary and liturgic language of the [[Slavs]], and the [[Glagolitic alphabet]].\n\n=== Bohemia ===\n{{Main|Bohemia}}\n[[File:Duchy of Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire in 11th century.svg|thumb|left|The [[Duchy of Bohemia]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 11th century]]\nThe [[Duchy of Bohemia]] emerged in the late 9th century, when it was unified by the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]]. In 10th century [[Boleslaus I, Duke of Bohemia]] conquered [[Moravia]], [[Silesia]] and expanded farther to the east. The Duchy of Bohemia, raised to the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] in 1198, was from 1002 until 1806 an [[Imperial State]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] alongside the [[Kingdom of Germany]], the [[Kingdom of Arles|Kingdom of Burgundy]], the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]] and numerous other territories such as the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] and various [[Papal States]]. The kingdom was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" from 1198) extracted the [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor, confirming Ottokar and his descendants' royal status; the [[Duchy]] of Bohemia was raised to a [[Realm|Kingdom]]. The bull declared that the King of Bohemia would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in imperial councils. German immigrants settled in the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. Germans populated towns and mining districts and, in some cases, formed German colonies in the interior of Bohemia. In 1235, the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] launched an [[Mongol invasion of Europe|invasion of Europe]]. After the [[Battle of Legnica]] in Poland, the Mongols carried their raids into Moravia, but were defensively defeated at the fortified town of [[Olomouc]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Grousset |first1=Ren\u00e9 |title=The Empire of the Steppes |date=1970 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8135-1304-1 |page=266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHzGvqRbV_IC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref> The Mongols subsequently invaded and defeated Hungary.<ref>Jan Dugosz, Maurice Michael (1997) ''The Annals of Jan Dlugosz'', IM Publications, {{ISBN|1-901019-00-4}}</ref>\n\n[[File:VaclavGelnhausenovekodexu.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wenceslaus I of Bohemia|Wenceslaus I]], [[List of Bohemian monarchs|King of Bohemia]] (1230\u20131253) of the [[P\u0159emyslid dynasty]], [[Gelnhausen Codex]]]]\nKing [[Ottokar II of Bohemia|P\u0159emysl Otakar II]] earned the nickname ''Iron and Golden King'' because of his military power and wealth.

[[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]] continued with the [[Hussites|Hussite movement]]. During the next two centuries, 90% of the population in Bohemian and Moravian lands were considered Hussites.

This period is characterized by lagging behind the West in almost every aspect of social and economic development. The country's GDP per capita fell from the level of neighboring Austria below that of Greece or Portugal in the 1980s. The Communist government completely [[Nationalization|nationalized]] the [[means of production]] and established a [[Planned economy|command economy]]. The economy grew rapidly during the 1950s but slowed down in the 1960s and 1970s and stagnated in the 1980s.\n\nThe political climate was highly repressive during the 1950s, including numerous [[show trial]]s (the most famous victims: [[Milada Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1]] and [[Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd]]) and hundreds of thousands of political prisoners, but became more open and tolerant in the late 1960s, culminating in [[Alexander Dub\u010dek]]'s leadership in the 1968 [[Prague Spring]], which tried to create \"[[socialism with a human face]]\" and perhaps even introduce political [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]]. This was forcibly ended by [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion]] by all [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries with the exception of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] on 21 August 1968.

Until 1989, the political establishment relied on censorship of the opposition. Dissidents published [[Charter 77]] in 1977, and the first of a new wave of protests were seen in 1988.

The Czech Republic joined [[NATO]] on 12 March 1999 and the [[European Union]] on 1 May 2004. On 21 December 2007 the Czech Republic joined the [[Schengen Area]].

[[Bohemia]], to the west, consists of a basin drained by the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] rivers, surrounded by mostly low mountains, such as the [[Krkono\u0161e]] range of the [[Sudetes]]. The highest point in the country, [[Sn\u011b\u017eka]] at {{convert|1603|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, is located here. Moravia, the eastern part of the country, is also quite hilly. It is drained mainly by the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]], but it also contains the source of the [[Oder]] River ({{lang-cs|Odra}}).\n\nWater from the landlocked Czech Republic flows to three different seas: the [[North Sea]], [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Black Sea]]. The Czech Republic also leases the [[Moldauhafen]], a {{convert|30000|m2|acre|adj=on}} [[lot (real estate)|lot]] in the middle of the [[Hamburg]] Docks, which was awarded to Czechoslovakia by Article 363 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], to allow the landlocked country a place where goods transported down river could be transferred to seagoing ships. The territory reverts to Germany in 2028.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], the Czech Republic belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]], within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of the Czech Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Western European broadleaf forests]], Central European mixed forests, Pannonian mixed forests, and Carpathian montane conifer forests.\n\nThere are four [[national park]]s in the Czech Republic. The oldest is [[Krkono\u0161e National Park]] ([[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserve]]), and the others are [[\u0160umava National Park]] (Biosphere Reserve), [[Podyj\u00ed National Park]], [[Bohemian Switzerland]].\n\nThe three historical lands of the Czech Republic (formerly the core countries of the Bohemian Crown) correspond almost perfectly with the river basins of the [[Elbe]] ({{lang-cs|Labe}}) and the [[Vltava]] basin for Bohemia, the Morava one for Moravia, and the Oder river basin for Czech Silesia (in terms of the Czech territory).\n\n{{multiple image\n | align  = center\n | total_width = 1000\n | width1 = 1300\n | height1 = 867\n | image1 = K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko - Podzimn\u00ed bu\u010dina.JPG\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 = [[Temperate deciduous forest]] in [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1tsko Protected Landscape Area]]\n | width2 = 1600\n | height2 = 1022\n | image2 = Kralicky-Sneznik-03.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = Rolling hills of [[Kr\u00e1lick\u00fd Sn\u011b\u017en\u00edk]] in northern Czech Republic\n | width3 = 3010\n | height3 = 2000\n | image3 = Podzim na Ka\u0161perku.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | caption3 = [[Bohemian Forest]] foothills and [[Ka\u0161perk]] castle, southern Bohemia\n | width4 = 5184\n | height4 = 3888\n | image4 = Berounka, z Kra\u0161ova k v\u00fdchodu.jpg\n | caption4 = [[Berounka]] river valley in western Bohemia\n | width5 = 1280\n | height5 = 960\n | image5 = \u010celadenka (CZE) - the river.jpg\n | caption5 = [[Moravian-Silesian Beskids|Beskids]] mountains in eastern Moravia\n}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:Czech Republic K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] types of the Czech Republic\n{{legend|#3dc6fa|[[Humid continental climate]]}}\n{{legend|#63fd32|[[Oceanic climate]]}}\n{{legend|#007e7e|[[Subarctic climate]]}}\n]]\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | total_width = 420\n | direction = horizontal\n | width1 = 2500 | height1 = 1667\n | image1 = Mala morava vojtiskov morava valley.jpg\n | caption1 = Northern Czech landscape during a summer morning\n | width2 = 3456 | height2 = 2304\n | image2 = Krkono\u0161e mountains in winter 2018 04.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Krkono\u0161e]] mountains in winter\n}}\n\nThe Czech Republic mostly has a temperate [[oceanic climate]], with warm summers and cold, cloudy and snowy winters.

In general, at higher altitudes, the temperatures decrease and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] increases. The wettest area in the Czech Republic is found around [[B\u00edl\u00fd Potok (Liberec District)|B\u00edl\u00fd Potok]] in [[Jizera Mountains]] and the driest region is the [[Louny District]] to the northwest of [[Prague]]. Another important factor is the distribution of the mountains; therefore, the climate is quite varied.\n\nAt the highest peak of [[Sn\u011b\u017eka]] ({{convert|1603|m|ft|abbr=on|0|disp=or}}), the average temperature is only {{convert|-0.4|C|F|0}}, whereas in the lowlands of the [[South Moravian Region]], the average temperature is as high as {{convert|10|C|F}}. The country's capital, [[Prague]], has a similar average temperature, although this is influenced by urban factors.\n\nThe coldest month is usually January, followed by February and December. During these months, there is usually snow in the mountains and sometimes in the major cities and lowlands. During March, April and May, the temperature usually increases rapidly, especially during April, when the temperature and weather tends to vary widely during the day. Spring is also characterized by high water levels in the rivers, due to melting snow with occasional flooding.\n\nThe warmest month of the year is July, followed by August and June. On average, summer temperatures are about {{convert|20|C-change|F-change}} \u2013 {{convert|30|C-change|F-change}} higher than during winter. Summer is also characterized by rain and storms.\n\nAutumn generally begins in September, which is still relatively warm and dry. During October, temperatures usually fall below {{convert|15|C|F}} or {{convert|10|C|F}} and [[deciduous]] trees begin to shed their leaves.

[[Nuclear power]] presently provides about 30 percent of the total power needs, its share is projected to increase to 40 percent. In 2005, 65.4 percent of electricity was produced by steam and combustion power plants (mostly coal); 30 percent by [[nuclear power|nuclear plants]]; and 4.6 percent from renewable sources, including hydropower. The largest Czech power resource is [[Temel\u00edn Nuclear Power Station]], another [[nuclear power plant]] is in [[Dukovany Nuclear Power Station|Dukovany]].\n\nThe Czech Republic is reducing its dependence on highly polluting low-grade [[Lignite|brown coal]] as a source of energy. Natural gas is procured from Russian [[Gazprom]], roughly three-fourths of domestic consumption and from Norwegian companies, which make up most of the remaining one-fourth.

The research based on cooperation between [[List of universities in the Czech Republic|universities]], [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic|Academy of Sciences]] and specialized research centers brings new inventions and impulses in this area. Important inventions include the modern [[contact lens]], the separation of modern [[blood type]]s, the modern genetics, many inventions in nanotechnologies and the production of [[Semtex]] [[plastic explosive]].\n\n==== Humanities ====\n[[File:Jan Hus 2.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Jan Hus]] (1369 \u2013 1415) is a key figure of the [[Bohemian Reformation]] and inspired the pre-[[Protestant]] [[Hussite movement]].]]\n[[Cyril and Methodius]] laid the foundations of education and the Czech theological thinking in the 9th century. Original theological and philosophical stream \u2013 [[Hussitism]] \u2013 originated in the Middle Ages. It was represented by [[Jan Hus]], [[Jerome of Prague]] or [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]]. At the end of the Middle Ages, [[Jan Amos Comenius]] substantially contributed to the development of modern pedagogy. Jewish philosophy in the Czech lands was represented mainly by [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] (known for the legend of the [[Golem]] of Prague). [[Bernard Bolzano]] was the personality of German-speaking philosophy in the Czech lands. [[Bohuslav Balb\u00edn]] was a key Czech philosopher and historian of the Baroque era. He also started the struggle for rescuing the Czech language. This culminated in the [[Czech national revival]] in the first half of the 19th century. Linguistics ([[Josef Dobrovsk\u00fd]], [[Pavel Jozef \u0160afa\u0159\u00edk]], [[Josef Jungmann]]), etnography ([[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]], [[Franti\u0161ek Ladislav \u010celakovsk\u00fd]]) and history ([[Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd]]) played a big role in revival. Palack\u00fd was the eminent personality. He wrote the first synthetic history of the Czech nation. He was also the first Czech modern politician and geopolitician (see also [[Austro-Slavism]]). He is often called \"The Father of the Nation\".\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century and at the beginning of the 20th century there was a huge development of social sciences. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk]] laid the foundations of Czech sociology. [[Konstantin Jire\u010dek]] founded Byzantology (see also [[Jire\u010dek Line]]). [[Alois Musil]] was a prominent orientalist, [[Emil Holub]] ethnographer. [[Lubor Niederle]] was a founder of modern Czech archeology. [[Sigmund Freud]] established psychoanalysis. [[Edmund Husserl]] defined a new philosophical doctrine \u2013 phenomenology. [[Joseph Schumpeter]] brought genuine economic ideas of \"creative destruction\" of capitalism. [[Hans Kelsen]] was significant legal theorist. [[Karl Kautsky]] influenced the history of Marxism. On the contrary, economist [[Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk]] led a campaign against Marxism. [[Max Wertheimer]] was one of the three founders of Gestalt psychology. Musicologists [[Eduard Hanslick]] and [[Guido Adler]] influenced debates on the development of classical music in Vienna.\n\nThe new Czechoslovak republic (1918\u20131938) wanted to develop sciences. Significant linguistic school was established in Prague \u2013 [[Prague Linguistic Circle]] ([[Vil\u00e9m Mathesius]], [[Jan Muka\u0159ovsk\u00fd]], [[Ren\u00e9 Wellek]]), moreover linguist [[Bed\u0159ich Hrozn\u00fd]] deciphered the ancient Hittite language and linguist [[Julius Pokorny]] deepened knowledge about Celtic languages. Philosopher [[Herbert Feigl]] was a member of the Vienna Circle. [[Ladislav Kl\u00edma]] has developed a special version of Nietzschean philosophy. In the second half of the 20th century can be mentioned philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]] who is considered one of the leading theoreticians on the issue of nationalism. Also Czech historian [[Miroslav Hroch]] analyzed modern nationalism. [[Vil\u00e9m Flusser]] developed the philosophy of technology and image. Marxist [[Karel Kos\u00edk]] was a major philosopher in the background of the Prague Spring 1968. [[Jan Pato\u010dka]] and [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] were the main ideologists of the Charter 77. [[Egon Bondy]] was a major philosophical spokesman of the Czech underground in the 1970s and 1980s. Czech Egyptology has scored some successes, its main representative is [[Miroslav Verner]]. Czech psychologist [[Stanislav Grof]] developed a method of \"Holotropic Breathwork\". Experimental archaeologist [[Pavel Pavel]] made several attempts, they had to answer the question how ancient civilizations transported heavy weights.\n\n==== Science and technology ====\n{{Prose|section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:Gregor Mendel portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gregor Mendel]], founder of [[genetics]]]]\n[[File:Jan Evangelista Purkyne 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jan Evangelista Purkyn\u011b]]]]\nFamous scientists who were born on the territory of the current Czech Republic:\n* [[Friedrich von Berchtold]] (1781\u20131876), botanist, an avid worker for Czech national revival.\n* [[Wenceslas Bojer]] (1795\u20131856), naturalist and botanist.\n* [[Ignaz von Born]] (1742\u20131791), mineralogist and metallurgist, one of founders of the Royal Bohemian Society of Sciences.\n* [[Stanislav Brebera]] (1925\u20132012), inventor of the [[plastic explosive]] [[Semtex]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web | title=Velik\u00e1ni \u010desk\u00e9 v\u011bdy | url=http://www.velikani-ceske-vedy.estranky.cz/clanky/biografie/stanislav-brebera |accessdate=1 November 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Josef \u010capek]] (1887\u20131945) and [[Karel \u010capek]] (1890\u20131938), brothers who originated the word [[robot]], for drama [[R.U.R.]]\n* [[Eduard \u010cech]] (1893\u20131960), mathematician with significant contributions in topology.\n* [[V\u00e1clav Prokop Divi\u0161]] (1698\u20131765), inventor of the first grounded [[lightning rod]].\n* [[Karel Domin]] (1882\u20131953), botanist, specialist in Australian taxonomy\n* [[Franti\u0161ek Josef Gerstner]] (1756\u20131832), physicist and engineer, built the first iron works and the first steam engine in Czech lands.\n* [[Gerty Cori|Gerty]] and [[Carl Cori]] \u2013 Nobel Prize laureates in Physiology or Medicine 1947.\n* [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] (1906\u20131978) logician and mathematician, who became famous for his two incompleteness theorems.\n* [[Peter Gr\u00fcnberg]] (* 1939) Nobel Prize laureate in Physics 2007.\n* [[Jaroslav Heyrovsk\u00fd]] (1890\u20131967), inventor of [[polarography]], [[Analytical chemistry|electroanalytical chemistry]] and recipient of the Nobel Prize.<ref name=\"science1\" />\n*[[Josef Hlavka]] (15 February 1831 \u2013 11 March 1908), was a Czech architect, builder, philanthropist and founder of the oldest Czech foundation for sciences and arts.\n* [[Anton\u00edn Hol\u00fd]] (1936\u20132012), scientist and chemist, in 2009 was involved in creation of the most effective drug in the treatment of AIDS.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eu2009.cz/en/czech-presidency/presidency-faces/faces-of-the-presidency-3642/ |title=Faces of the Presidency |accessdate=8 January 2009 |work= eu2009.cz|publisher=EU2009.cz |date=}}</ref>\n* [[Jakub Husn\u00edk]] (1837\u20131916), improved the process of [[photolithography]].\n* [[Jan Jansk\u00fd]] (1873\u20131921), serologist and neurologist, discovered the [[ABO blood groups]].\n* [[Georg Joseph Kamel]] (1661\u20131706), Czech Jesuit, pharmacist and naturalist known for producing first comprehensive accounts of the Philippine flora;  genus of flowering plants Camellia is named in his honor.\n* [[Karel Kl\u00ed\u010d]] (1841\u20131926), painter and photographer, inventor of the [[photogravure]].\n* [[Franti\u0161ek K\u0159i\u017e\u00edk]] (1847\u20131941), electrical engineer, inventor of the [[arc lamp]].\n* [[Julius Vincenz von Krombholz]] (1782\u20131843), biologist, founder of the great tradition of Czech mycology.* [[Johann Josef Loschmidt]] (1821\u20131895), chemist, performed ground-breaking work in crystal forms.\n* [[Ernst Mach]] (1838\u20131916) physicist and critic of Newton's theories of space and time, foreshadowing Einstein's theory of relativity.\n* [[Jan Marek Marci]] (1595\u20131667), mathematician, physicist and imperial physician, one of the founders of [[spectroscopy]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burns|first1=Thorburn|editor1-last=Burgess|editor1-first=C.|editor2-last=Mielenz|editor2-first=K.

After the [[Bohemian Reformation]], most Czechs became [[Hussites|followers]] of [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]] and other regional [[Protestant Reformers]]. [[Taborites]] and [[Utraquists]] were major [[Hussite]] groups. During the [[Hussite Wars]], Utraquists sided with the Catholic Church. Following the joint Utraquist\u2014Catholic victory, Utraquism was accepted as a distinct form of Christianity to be practiced in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] by the [[Catholic Church]] while all remaining Hussite groups were prohibited. After the [[Reformation]], some Bohemians went with the [[Lutheranism|teachings of Martin Luther]], especially [[Sudeten Germans]]. In the wake of the Reformation, Utraquist Hussites took a renewed increasingly [[anti-Catholic]] stance, while some of the defeated Hussite factions (notably Taborites) were revived. After the [[Habsburgs]] regained control of Bohemia, the whole population was forcibly converted to Catholicism\u2014even the Utraquist Hussites. Going forward, Czechs have become more wary and pessimistic of religion as such. A long history of resistance to the Catholic Church followed. It suffered a schism with the neo-Hussite [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] in 1920, lost the bulk of its adherents during the Communist era and continues to lose in the modern, ongoing [[secularization]].

Since the Middle Ages, the Czech lands have been using the same architectural styles as most of [[Western Europe|Western]] and Central Europe. The oldest still standing churches were built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque style]] ([[St. George's Basilica, Prague|St. George's Basilica]], [[St. Procopius Basilica in T\u0159eb\u00ed\u010d]]). During the 13th century it was replaced by the [[Czech Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] ([[Charles Bridge]], [[Bethlehem Chapel]], [[Old New Synagogue]], [[Sedlec Ossuary]], [[Old Town Hall (Prague)|Old Town Hall]] with [[Prague astronomical clock]], [[Church of Our Lady before T\u00fdn]]). In the 14th century Emperor Charles IV invited to his court in Prague talented architects from France and Germany, [[Matthias of Arras]] and [[Peter Parler]] ([[Karl\u0161tejn]], [[St. Vitus Cathedral]], [[St. Barbara's Church, Kutn\u00e1 Hora|St. Barbara's Church in Kutn\u00e1 Hora]]). During the Middle Ages, many fortified castles were built by the king and aristocracy, as well as many monasteries ([[Strahov Monastery]], [[\u0160pilberk]], [[K\u0159ivokl\u00e1t Castle]], [[Vy\u0161\u0161\u00ed Brod Monastery]]). During the [[Hussite wars]], many of them were damaged or destroyed.\n\nThe [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance style]] penetrated the Bohemian Crown in the late 15th century when the older Gothic style started to be slowly mixed with Renaissance elements (architects [[Mat\u011bj Rejsek]], [[Benedikt Rejt]] and their [[Powder Tower]]). An outstanding example of the pure Renaissance architecture in Bohemia is the [[Royal Summer Palace]], which was situated in a newly established garden of [[Prague Castle]]. Evidence of the general reception of the Renaissance in Bohemia, involving a massive influx of Italian architects, can be found in spacious ch\u00e2teaux with elegant arcade courtyards and geometrically arranged gardens ([[Litomy\u0161l Castle]], [[Hlubok\u00e1 Castle]]).<ref name=architecture>{{cite web|title=History of Czech Architecture|url=http://eu2009.cz/en/czech-republic/architecture-and-design/history/history-of-czech-architecture-2461/|website=eu2009.cz|publisher=Czech Presidency of the European Union|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref> Emphasis was placed on comfort, and buildings that were built for entertainment purposes also appeared.<ref name=czecharchitecture>{{cite web|title=The History of Architecture|url=http://www.czech.cz/en/66608-the-history-of-architecture|website=www.czech.cz|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 17th century, the Baroque style spread throughout the Crown of Bohemia. Very outstanding are the architectural projects of the Czech nobleman and imperial generalissimo [[Albrecht von Wallenstein]] from the 1620s ([[Wallenstein Palace]]). His architects Andrea Spezza and [[Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni|Giovanni Pieroni]] reflected the most recent Italian production and were very innovative at the same time. [[Czech Baroque architecture]] is considered to be a unique part of the European cultural heritage thanks to its extensiveness and extraordinariness ([[Krom\u011b\u0159\u00ed\u017e Castle]], [[Holy Trinity Column in Olomouc]], [[St. Nicholas Church (Mal\u00e1 Strana)|St. Nicholas Church at Mal\u00e1 Strana]], [[Karlova Koruna Chateau]]). In the first third of the 18th century the Bohemian lands were one of the leading artistic centers of the Baroque style. In Bohemia there was completed the development of the Radical Baroque style created in Italy by [[Francesco Borromini]] and [[Guarino Guarini]] in a very original way.<ref name=kotalik>{{cite book|last=Kotal\u00edk|first=Ji\u0159\u00ed|title=Architektura barokn\u00ed|year=2002|publisher=Spr\u00e1va Pra\u017esk\u00e9ho hradu a DaDa|location=Praha|isbn=978-80-86161-38-9|page=13|edition=Deset stolet\u00ed architektury|language=Czech}}</ref> Leading architects of the Bohemian Baroque were [[Jean Baptiste Mathey|Jean-Baptiste Mathey]], [[Franti\u0161ek Maxmili\u00e1n Ka\u0148ka]], [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]], and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]].\n\nIn the 18th century Bohemia produced an architectural peculiarity \u2013 the ''Baroque Gothic style'', a synthesis of the Gothic and Baroque styles. This was not a simple return to Gothic details, but rather an original Baroque transformation. The main representative and originator of this style was [[Jan Bla\u017eej Santini-Aichel]], who used this style in renovating medieval monastic buildings or in [[Pilgrimage Church of Saint John of Nepomuk]].<ref name=architecture />\n\nDuring the 19th century, the [[Revival architecture|revival architectural styles]] were very popular in the Bohemian monarchy. Many churches were restored to their presumed medieval appearance and there were constructed many new buildings in the [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]], [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] and [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] styles ([[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre]], [[Lednice\u2013Valtice Cultural Landscape]], [[Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul, Brno|Cathedral of St. Peter and Paul in Brno]]). At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the new art style appeared in the Czech lands \u2013 [[Art Nouveau]]. The best-known representatives of Czech Art Nouveau architecture were [[Osvald Pol\u00edvka]], who designed the [[Municipal House]] in Prague, [[Josef Fanta]], the architect of the [[Praha hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed|Prague Main Railway Station]], [[Jan Letzel]], [[Josef Hoffmann]] and [[Jan Kot\u011bra]].\n\nBohemia contributed an unusual style to the world's architectural heritage when Czech architects attempted to transpose the [[Cubism]] of painting and sculpture into architecture ([[House of the Black Madonna]]). During the first years of the independent Czechoslovakia (after 1918), a specifically Czech architectural style, called ''Rondo-Cubism'', came into existence. Together with the pre-war [[Cubism#Czech Cubist architecture|Czech Cubist architecture]] it is unparalleled elsewhere in the world. The first Czechoslovak president [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk|T. G. Masaryk]] invited the prominent [[Slovenia|Slovene]] architect [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]] to Prague, where he modernized the [[Prague Castle|Castle]] and built some other buildings ([[Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord]]).\n\nBetween World Wars I and II, [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]], with its sober, progressive forms, took over as the main architectural style in the newly established Czechoslovak Republic. In the city of Brno, one of the most impressive functionalist works has been preserved \u2013 [[Villa Tugendhat]], designed by the architect [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref name=architecture /> The most significant Czech architects of this era were [[Adolf Loos]], [[Pavel Jan\u00e1k]] and [[Josef Go\u010d\u00e1r]].\n\nAfter World War II and the Communist coup in 1948, art in Czechoslovakia became strongly Soviet influenced. [[Hotel International Prague|Hotel International]] in Prague is a brilliant example of the so-called [[Socialist realism]], the Stalinistic art style of the 1950s. The Czechoslovak avant-garde artistic movement known as the ''[[Brussels style]]'' (named after the Brussels World's Fair [[Expo 58]]) became popular in the time of political liberalization of Czechoslovakia in the 1960s. [[Brutalism]] dominated in the 70s and 80s ([[Kotva Department Store]]).\n\nEven today, the Czech Republic is not shying away from the most modern trends of international architecture. This fact is attested to by a number of projects by world-renowned architects ([[Frank Gehry]] and his [[Dancing House]], [[Jean Nouvel]], [[Ricardo Bofill]], and [[John Pawson]]). There are also contemporary Czech architects whose works can be found all over the world ([[Vlado Miluni\u0107]], [[Eva Ji\u0159i\u010dn\u00e1]], [[Jan Kaplick\u00fd]]).<ref name=architecture />\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Czech literature}}\n[[File:Kafka portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Kafka]]]]\n[[File:Jaroslav Seifert 1981 foto Hana Hamplov\u00e1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Jaroslav Seifert]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]]]\n\nIn a strict sense, [[Czech literature]] is the literature written in the [[Czech language]]. A more liberal definition incorporates all literary works written in the Czech lands regardless of language. The literature from the area of today's Czech Republic was mostly written in Czech, but also in [[Latin]] and German or even [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Thus [[Franz Kafka]], who\u2014while bilingual in Czech and German{{sfn|Hawes|2008|p = 29}}{{sfn|Sayer|1996|pp = 164\u2013210}}\u2014wrote his works (''[[The Trial]]'', ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]'') in German, during the era of Austrian rule, can represent the [[Czech literature|Czech]], German or [[Austrian literature]] depending on the point of view.\n\nInfluential Czech authors who wrote in Latin include [[Cosmas of Prague]] (\u2020 1125), [[Martin of Opava]] (\u2020 1278), [[Peter of Zittau]] (\u2020 1339), [[Jan Hus|John Hus]] (\u2020 1415), [[Bohuslav Hasi\u0161tejnsk\u00fd z Lobkovic]] (1461\u20131510), [[Jan Dubravius]] (1486\u20131553), [[Tade\u00e1\u0161 H\u00e1jek]] (1525\u20131600), [[Johannes Vodnianus Campanus]] (1572\u20131622), [[John Amos Comenius]] (1592\u20131670), and [[Bohuslav Balb\u00edn]] (1621\u20131688).\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, the royal court in Prague became one of the centers of the German [[Minnesang]] and courtly literature ([[Reinmar von Zweter]], [[Heinrich von Freiberg]], Ulrich von Etzenbach, [[Wenceslaus II of Bohemia]]). The most famous Czech medieval German-language work is the ''Ploughman of Bohemia'' (''[[Der Ackermann aus B\u00f6hmen]]''), written around 1401 by [[Johannes von Tepl]]. The heyday of Czech German-language literature can be seen in the first half of the 20th century, which is represented by the well-known names of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Max Brod]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], [[Egon Kisch|Egon Erwin Kisch]], and others.\n\n[[Bible translations into Czech|Bible translations]] played an important role in the development of Czech literature and the standard Czech language. The oldest Czech translation of the [[Psalms]] originated in the late 13th century and the first complete Czech translation of the Bible was finished around 1360. The first complete printed Czech Bible was published in 1488 ([[Prague Bible]]). The first complete Czech Bible translation from the original languages was published between 1579 and 1593 and is known as the [[Bible of Kralice]]. The [[Codex Gigas]] from the 12th century is the largest extant medieval manuscript in the world.\n\nCzech-language literature can be divided into several periods: the Middle Ages ([[Chronicle of Dalimil]]); the Hussite period ([[Tom\u00e1\u0161 \u0160t\u00edtn\u00fd ze \u0160t\u00edtn\u00e9ho]], [[Jan Hus]], [[Petr Chel\u010dick\u00fd]]); the [[Renaissance humanism]] ([[Henry the Younger of Pod\u011bbrady]], [[Luke of Prague]], [[Wenceslaus Hajek]], [[Jan Blahoslav]], [[Daniel Adam z Veleslav\u00edna]]); the Baroque period ([[John Amos Comenius]], [[Adam V\u00e1clav Michna z Otradovic]], [[Bed\u0159ich Bridel]], [[Jan Franti\u0161ek Beckovsk\u00fd]]); the Enlightenment and Czech reawakening in the first half of the 19th century ([[V\u00e1clav Mat\u011bj Kramerius]], [[Karel Hynek M\u00e1cha]], [[Karel Jarom\u00edr Erben]], [[Karel Havl\u00ed\u010dek Borovsk\u00fd]], [[Bo\u017eena N\u011bmcov\u00e1]], [[J\u00e1n Koll\u00e1r]], [[Josef Kajet\u00e1n Tyl]]), modern literature in second half of the 19th century ([[Jan Neruda]], [[Alois Jir\u00e1sek]], [[Viktor Dyk]], [[Jaroslav Vrchlick\u00fd]], [[Julius Zeyer]], [[Svatopluk \u010cech]]); the avant-garde of the interwar period ([[Karel \u010capek]], [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]], [[V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval]], [[Jaroslav Seifert]], [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Wolker]], [[Vladim\u00edr Holan]]); the years under Communism and the Prague Spring ([[Josef \u0160kvoreck\u00fd]], [[Bohumil Hrabal]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[Arno\u0161t Lustig]], [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], [[Pavel Kohout]], [[Ivan Kl\u00edma]]); and the literature of the post-Communist Czech Republic ([[Ivan Martin Jirous]], [[Michal Viewegh]], [[J\u00e1chym Topol]], [[Patrik Ou\u0159edn\u00edk]], [[Kate\u0159ina Tu\u010dkov\u00e1]]).\n\nNoted journalists include [[Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk (journalist)|Julius Fu\u010d\u00edk]], [[Milena Jesensk\u00e1]], and [[Ferdinand Peroutka]].\n\n[[Jaroslav Seifert]] was the only Czech writer awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. The famous antiwar comedy novel ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]'' by [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]] is the most translated Czech book in history. It was adapted by [[Karel Stekl\u00fd]] in two color films ''[[The Good Soldier Schweik (1956 film)|The Good Soldier Schweik]]'' in 1956 and 1957. Widely translated Czech books are also Milan Kundera's ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'' and Karel \u010capek's ''[[War with the Newts]]''.\n\nThe international literary award the [[Franz Kafka Prize]] is awarded in the Czech Republic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.franzkafka-soc.cz/cena-franze-kafky/|title=Spole\u010dnost Franze Kafky \u2013 Cena Franze Kafky|website=www.franzkafka-soc.cz}}</ref>\n\nThe Czech Republic has the densest network of libraries in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.praguemorning.cz/the-czech-republic-has-the-densest-library-network-in-the-world/|title=The Czech Republic Has The Densest Library Network In The World|first=Dave|last=Patterson|date=21 July 2016}}</ref> At its center stands the [[National Library of the Czech Republic]], based in the baroque complex [[Klementinum]].\n\nCzech literature and culture played a major role on at least two occasions when Czechs lived under oppression and political activity was suppressed. On both of these occasions, in the early 19th century and then again in the 1960s, the Czechs used their cultural and literary effort to strive for political freedom, establishing a confident, politically aware nation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Dvorak.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]]]\n[[File:Dvorak Bedrich Smetana and friends in 1865.jpg|thumb|[[Bed\u0159ich Smetana]] on the painting of [[Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k (painter)|Franti\u0161ek Dvo\u0159\u00e1k]]]]\n{{Main|Music of the Czech Lands|Moravian traditional music}}\n\nThe musical tradition of the Czech lands arose from first church hymns, whose first evidence is suggested at the break of 10th and 11th century.

The first brewery is known to have existed in 993 and the Czech Republic has the highest [[List of countries by beer consumption per capita|beer consumption per capita]] in the world. The famous \"[[pilsner]] style beer\" (pils) originated in the western Bohemian city of [[Plze\u0148]], where the world's first-ever blond lager [[Pilsner Urquell]] is still being produced, making it the inspiration for more than two-thirds of the beer produced in the world today. Further south the town of [[\u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice]], known as Budweis in German, lent its name to its beer, eventually known as [[Budweiser Budvar]]. Apart from these and other major brands, the Czech Republic also has a growing number of small breweries and mini-breweries.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nTourism is slowly growing around the Southern Moravian region too, which has been producing [[Czech wine|wine]] since the Middle Ages; about 94% of [[vineyard]]s in the Czech Republic are Moravian.

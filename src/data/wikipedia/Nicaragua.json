largest country in the [[Central America]]n [[isthmus]], bordered by [[Honduras]] to the northwest, the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] to the east, [[Costa Rica]] to the south, and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the southwest. [[Managua]] is the country's capital and largest city and is also  the third-largest city in [[Central America]], behind [[Tegucigalpa]] and [[Guatemala City]]. The multi-ethnic population of six million includes people of indigenous, European, African, and Asian heritage. The main language is Spanish. Indigenous tribes on the [[Mosquito Coast]] speak their own languages and English.\n\nOriginally inhabited by various indigenous cultures since ancient times, the [[Spanish Empire]] conquered the region in the 16th century. Nicaragua gained independence from Spain in 1821. The Mosquito Coast followed a different historical path, with the English colonizing it in the 17th century and later coming under the British rule, as well as some minor Spanish interludes in the 19th century. It became an autonomous territory of Nicaragua in 1860 and the northernmost part of it was later transferred to [[Honduras]] in 1960. Since its independence, Nicaragua has undergone periods of political unrest, dictatorship, occupation and fiscal crisis, leading to the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] of the 1960s and 1970s and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] of the 1980s.\n\nThe mixture of cultural traditions has generated substantial diversity in folklore, cuisine, music, and literature, particularly the latter given the literary contributions of Nicaraguan poets and writers, such as [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]].

The lowland area runs from the [[Gulf of Fonseca]] to Nicaragua's Pacific border with Costa Rica south of [[Lake Nicaragua]]. Lake Nicaragua is the largest freshwater lake in Central America (20th largest in the world),<ref>{{cite news|title=Large Lakes of the World|url=http://www.factmonster.com/ipka/A0001777.html|accessdate=2007-05-25|work=factmonster.com}}</ref> and is home to some of the world's rare freshwater sharks ([[bull shark|Nicaraguan shark]]).<ref>{{cite news|work=nature.org|title=The Nature Conservancy in Nicaragua|url=http://www.nature.org/wherewework/centralamerica/nicaragua/|accessdate=2007-05-25}}</ref> The Pacific lowlands region is the most populous, with over half of the nation's population.\n\nThe eruptions of western Nicaragua's 40 volcanoes, many of which are still active, have sometimes devastated settlements but also have enriched the land with layers of fertile ash.

About a quarter of the country's agriculture takes place in this region, with coffee grown on the higher slopes.

Nicaragua is located in the middle of the Americas and this privileged location has enabled the country to serve as host to a great biodiversity. This factor, along with the weather and light altitudinal variations, allows the country to harbor 248 species of amphibians and reptiles, 183 species of mammals, 705 bird species, 640 fish species, and about 5,796 species of plants.\n\nThe region of great forests is located on the eastern side of the country. Rainforests are found in the [[R\u00edo San Juan Department]] and in the autonomous regions of [[North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|RAAN]] and [[South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|RAAS]]. This biome groups together the greatest biodiversity in the country and is largely protected by the [[Indio Ma\u00edz Biological Reserve]] in the south and the [[Bosaw\u00e1s Biosphere Reserve]] in the north.

[[Executive (government)|Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislature|Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[National Assembly of Nicaragua|national assembly]]. The [[judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, Nicaragua's major political parties discussed the possibility of going from a presidential system to a parliamentary system. Their reason: there would be a clear differentiation between the [[head of government]] (prime minister) and the [[head of state]] (president). Nevertheless, it was later argued that the true reason behind this proposal was to find a legal way for President Ortega to stay in power after January 2012, when his second and last government period was expected to end. Ortega was reelected to a third term in November 2016.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Further|Foreign relations of Nicaragua}}\nNicaragua pursues an independent foreign policy.

There are roughly 14,000 active duty personnel, which is much less compared to the numbers seen during the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]]. Although the army has had a rough military history, a portion of its forces, which were known as the [[National Guard (Nicaragua)|national guard]], became integrated with what is now the [[Polic\u00eda Nacional (Nicaragua)|National Police of Nicaragua]]. In essence, the police became a ''[[gendarmerie]]''. The National Police of Nicaragua are rarely, if ever, labeled as a ''[[gendarmerie]]''. The other elements and manpower that were not devoted to the national police were sent over to cultivate the new Army of Nicaragua.\n\nThe age to serve in the armed forces is 17 and [[conscription]] is not imminent. {{As of|2006}}, the military budget was roughly 0.7% of Nicaragua's expenditures.\n\n=== Law enforcement ===\n\n[[File:600x400 1329442889 170212amb-nota2,photo01.jpg|thumb| [[National Police of Nicaragua]].]]\n\nThe [[National Police of Nicaragua]] Force (in Spanish: La Polic\u00eda Nacional Nicarag\u00fcense) is the national police of Nicaragua.

Almost all of the upper class and nearly a quarter of the middle class are substantial landowners.\n\nA 1985 government study classified 69.4 percent of the population as poor on the basis that they were unable to satisfy one or more of their basic needs in housing, sanitary services (water, sewage, and garbage collection), education, and employment. The defining standards for this study were very low; housing was considered substandard if it was constructed of discarded materials with dirt floors or if it was occupied by more than four persons per room.\n\nRural workers are dependent on agricultural wage labor, especially in coffee and cotton. Only a small fraction hold permanent jobs. Most are migrants who follow crops during the harvest period and find other work during the off-season. The \"lower\" peasants are typically smallholders without sufficient land to sustain a family; they also join the harvest labor force. The \"upper\" peasants have sufficient resources to be economically independent. They produce enough surplus, beyond their personal needs, to allow them to participate in the national and world markets.\n\n[[File:Rotonda Ruben dario.jpg|thumb|left| The capital city [[Managua]] at night]]The urban lower class is characterized by the informal sector of the economy. The informal sector consists of small-scale enterprises that utilize traditional technologies and operate outside the legal regime of labor protections and taxation. Workers in the informal sector are self-employed, unsalaried family workers or employees of small-enterprises, and they are generally poor.\n\nNicaragua's informal sector workers include tinsmiths, mattress makers, seamstresses, bakers, shoemakers, and carpenters; people who take in laundry and ironing or prepare food for sale in the streets; and thousands of peddlers, owners of small businesses (often operating out of their own homes), and market stall operators. Some work alone, but others labor in the small talleres   (workshops/factories) that are responsible for a large share of the country's industrial production. Because informal sector earnings are generally very low, few families can subsist on one income.<ref name=\"Nicaragua \u2013 SOCIETY\">{{cite web |title=Nicaragua \u2013 SOCIETY |quote=CITATION: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress.

It was under British influence for nearly three centuries. [[Protestantism]] was brought to the [[Mosquito Coast]] mainly by British and German colonists in forms of [[Anglicanism]] and the [[Moravian Church]]. Other kinds of Protestant and other [[Christian denomination]]s were introduced to the rest of Nicaragua during the 19th century.\n\nPopular religion revolves around the saints, who are perceived as intercessors (but not mediators) between human beings and God. Most localities, from the capital of Managua to small rural communities, honour [[patron saint]]s, selected from the Roman Catholic calendar, with annual ''fiestas''. In many communities, a rich lore has grown up around the celebrations of patron saints, such as Managua's Saint Dominic (Santo Domingo), honoured in August with two colourful, often riotous, day-long processions through the city. The high point of Nicaragua's religious calendar for the masses is neither Christmas nor Easter, but La Pur\u00edsima, a week of festivities in early December dedicated to the [[Immaculate Conception]], during which elaborate altars to the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] are constructed in homes and workplaces.<ref name=LOCR/>\n\nThe country's close political ties have encouraged religious ties.{{explain|date=March 2018}} [[Buddhism]] has increased with a steady influx of immigration.<ref>[http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/octubre/24-octubre-2004/mundo_oculto/mundo_oculto-20041020-01.html Con Todo el Poder de la Informmaci\u00f3n \u2013 El Nuevo Diario \u2013 Managua, Nicaragua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513110733/http://archivo.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2004/octubre/24-octubre-2004/mundo_oculto/mundo_oculto-20041020-01.html |date=2011-05-13 }}.

The 2005 census showed the foreign-born population at 1.2%, having risen a mere .06% in 10 years.<ref name=CN/>\n\nIn the 19th century, Nicaragua experienced modest waves of immigration from Europe.

This community numbers about 30,000. There is an East Asian community mostly consisting of [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]], and [[Japanese people|Japanese]].

Nicaraguan culture can further be defined in several distinct strands. The Pacific coast has strong folklore, music and religious traditions, deeply influenced by [[Iberian Peninsula|Europeans]]. It was colonized by Spain and has a similar culture to other Spanish-speaking Latin American countries. The indigenous groups that historically inhabited the Pacific coast have largely been assimilated into the [[mestizo]] culture.\n\nThe Caribbean coast of Nicaragua was once a British protectorate. English is still predominant in this region and spoken domestically along with Spanish and [[Languages of Nicaragua|indigenous languages]]. Its culture is similar to that of Caribbean nations that were or are British possessions, such as [[Jamaica]], Belize, the [[Cayman Islands]], etc. Unlike on the west coast, the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean coast have maintained distinct identities, and some still speak their native languages as first languages.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Nicaragua}}\n[[Music of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan music]] is a mixture of indigenous and Spanish influences. Musical instruments include the [[marimba]] and others common across Central America. The marimba of Nicaragua is played by a sitting performer holding the instrument on his knees. He is usually accompanied by a bass [[fiddle]], guitar and guitarrilla (a small guitar like a [[mandolin]]). This music is played at social functions as a sort of background music.\n\nThe marimba is made with hardwood plates placed over bamboo or metal tubes of varying lengths. It is played with two or four [[hammer]]s. The Caribbean coast of Nicaragua is known for a lively, sensual form of [[dance music]] called ''[[Palo de Mayo]]'' which is popular throughout the country.

[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], [[Merengue music|Merengue]], [[Salsa music|Salsa]] and [[Cumbia music|Cumbia]] have gained prominence in cultural centres such as Managua, Leon and [[Granada]]. Cumbia dancing has grown popular with the introduction of Nicaraguan artists, including Gustavo Leyton, on [[Ometepe Island]] and in Managua. [[Salsa dancing]] has become extremely popular in Managua's nightclubs. With various influences, the form of salsa dancing varies in Nicaragua. New York style and Cuban Salsa (Salsa Casino) elements have gained popularity across the country.\n\n=== Dance ===\n{{Further|Dance in Nicaragua}}\nDance in Nicaragua varies depending upon the region. Rural areas tend to have a stronger focus on movement of the hips and turns. The dance style in cities focuses primarily on more sophisticated footwork in addition to movement and turns. Combinations of styles from the [[Dominican Republic]] and the United States can be found throughout Nicaragua. [[Bachata (dance)|Bachata dancing]] is popular in Nicaragua. A considerable amount of Bachata dancing influence comes from Nicaraguans living abroad, in cities that include Miami, Los Angeles and, to a much lesser extent, New York City. [[Tango (dance)|Tango]] has also surfaced recently in cultural cities and ballroom dance occasions.\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Literature of Nicaragua}}\n[[File:Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]], the founder of the [[modernismo]] literary movement in Latin America.]]\nThe origin of [[literature of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan literature]] can arguably be traced to [[pre-Columbian]] times. The myths and [[oral literature]] formed the cosmogenic view of the world of the indigenous people. Some of these stories are still known in Nicaragua. Like many Latin American countries, the Spanish conquerors have had the most effect on both the culture and the literature. Nicaraguan literature has historically been an important source of poetry in the Spanish-speaking world, with internationally renowned contributors such as [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]] who is regarded as the most important literary figure in Nicaragua. He is called the \"Father of Modernism\" for leading the ''[[modernismo]]'' literary movement at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=NI/> Other literary figures include [[Carlos Martinez Rivas]], [[Pablo Antonio Cuadra]], Alberto Cuadra Mejia, Manolo Cuadra, Pablo Alberto Cuadra Arguello, Orlando Cuadra Downing, Alfredo Alegr\u00eda Rosales, [[Sergio Ramirez Mercado]], [[Ernesto Cardenal]], [[Gioconda Belli]], [[Claribel Alegr\u00eda]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Coronel Urtecho]], among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=es&tl=en&u=http://elcomercio.pe/edicionimpresa/Html/2008-01-20/nicaragua-eterna-tierra-poetas.html&act=url|title=Nicaragua, Eternal Land of Poets|publisher=Elcomercio.pe|accessdate=2010-06-26}}</ref>\n\nThe satirical drama ''[[El G\u00fceg\u00fcense]]'' was the first literary work of post-Columbian Nicaragua.

The islands were historically known by the inhabitants as \"jolet jen Anij\" (Gifts from God).<ref name=pacificrisa/>\n\nSpain claimed the islands in 1592, and the European powers recognized its sovereignty over the islands in 1874. They had been part of the [[Spanish East Indies]] formally since 1528. Later, Spain sold some of the islands to the [[German Empire]] in 1885, and they became part of [[German New Guinea]] that year, run by the trading companies doing business in the islands, particularly the Jaluit Company.<ref name=\"bbc.com\"/> In [[World War I]] the [[Empire of Japan]] occupied the Marshall Islands, which in 1920, the [[League of Nations]] combined with other former German territories to form the [[South Pacific Mandate]]. During [[World War II]], the [[United States]] took control of the islands in the [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign]] in 1944. Nuclear testing began in 1946 and concluded in 1958.\n\nThe US government formed the Congress of Micronesia in 1965, a plan for increased self-governance of Pacific islands. The [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]] in 1979 provided independence to the Marshall Islands, whose constitution and president (Amata Kabua) were formally recognized by the US. Full sovereignty or [[Self-government]] was achieved in a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States. Marshall Islands has been a member of the [[Pacific Community]] (SPC) since 1983 and a [[United Nations]] member state since 1991.<ref name=\"bbc.com\"/> Politically, the Marshall Islands is a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with the United States, with the US providing defense, subsidies, and access to U.S.-based agencies such as the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and the [[United States Postal Service]]. With few natural resources, the islands' wealth is based on a [[service economy]], as well as some [[fishing]] and [[agriculture]]; aid from the United States represents a large percentage of the islands' [[gross domestic product]]. The country uses the [[United States dollar]] as its currency.

The islands were mostly left to their own affairs except for short-lived religious missions (documented in 1668 and 1731) during the 16th and 17th centuries. They were largely ignored by European powers except for cartographic demarcation treaties between the Iberian Empires (Portugal and Castilian Spain) in 1529, 1750 and 1777. The archipelago corresponding to the present-day country was independently named by [[Adam Johann von Krusenstern|Krusenstern]], after [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] [[explorer]] [[John Marshall (British captain)|John Marshall]], who visited them together with [[Thomas Gilbert (captain)|Thomas Gilbert]] in 1788, en route from [[Botany Bay]] to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] (two ships of the [[First Fleet]]), and started establishing German and British trading posts, not formally contested by Spain.\n\nThe Marshall Islands were formally claimed by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1874 through its capital in the East Indies, [[Manila]], marking the start of several strategic moves by the [[German Empire|Second Reich]] during the 1870s and 80s to annex them (claiming them to be \"by chance unoccupied\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://repositorio.uc.cl/bitstream/handle/11534/9719/000319582.pdf?sequence=1|title=LA CUESTION DE LAS ISLAS CAROLINAS.

This policy would culminate in a tense naval episode in 1885, which did not degenerate into a conflict due to the poor readiness of Spain's naval forces and the unwillingness for open military action from the German side.\n\nFollowing [[papal]] mediation and German compensation of $4.5 million, Spain reached an agreement with [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1885: the 1885 Hispano-German Protocol of Rome. This accord established a [[protectorate]] and set up trading stations on the islands of [[Jaluit]] (Jol\u00f3) and [[Ebon Atoll|Ebon]] to carry out the flourishing [[copra]] (dried [[coconut]] meat) trade. Marshallese [[Iroij]] (high chiefs) continued to rule under indirect colonial German administration, rendered tacitly effective by the wording in the 1885 Protocol, which demarcated an area subject to Spanish sovereignty (0-11\u00baN, 133-164\u00baE) omitting the Eastern Carolines, that is, the Marshall and Gilbert archipelagos, where most of the German trading posts were located.<ref>{{Cite book|title=El conflicto sobre las Islas Carolinas entre Espa\u00f1a y Alemania (1885): la mediaci\u00f3n internacional de Le\u00f3n XIII|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=QH7v65BXBHUC}}|last=Corral|first=Carlos|publisher=Editorial Complutense|year=1995|isbn=9788474914849|location=|pages=}}</ref> The disputes were rendered moot after the selling of the whole Caroline archipelago to Germany 13 years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/places/australia-and-oceania/pacific-islands-political-geography/caroline-islands|title=Caroline Islands {{!}} Encyclopedia.com|website=www.encyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[World War I]], [[Japan]] assumed control of the Marshall Islands.

On January 31, 1944 American forces landed on [[Kwajalein]] [[atoll]] and U.S. Marines and Army troops later took control of the islands from the Japanese on February 3, following intense fighting on Kwajalein and [[Enewetak Atoll|Enewetak]] atolls. In 1947, the United States, as the occupying power, entered into an agreement with the [[UN Security Council]] to administer much of [[Micronesia]], including the Marshall Islands, as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]].\n\nFrom 1946 to 1958, it served as the [[Pacific Proving Grounds]] for the United States and was the site of 67 [[nuclear test]]s on various atolls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/325643/marshall-islands-marks-71-years-since-start-of-us-nuclear-tests-on-bikini|title=Marshall Islands marks 71 years since start of US nuclear tests on Bikini|date=2017-03-01|website=Radio New Zealand|language=en-nz|access-date=2019-01-16}}</ref> The world's first [[hydrogen bomb]], codenamed \"[[Ivy Mike|Mike]]\", was tested at the [[Enewetak]] atoll in the Marshall Islands on November 1, (local date) in 1952, by the United States.\n\n[[File:Castle Bravo Blast.jpg|thumb|left|Mushroom cloud from the largest atmospheric [[nuclear test]] the [[United States]] ever conducted, [[Castle Bravo]].]]\nNuclear testing began in 1946 on [[Bikini Atoll]] after residents were evacuated.

Over the years, just one of over 60 islands was cleaned by the US government, and the inhabitants are still waiting for the 2 billion dollars in compensation assessed by the Nuclear Claims Tribunal.

The constitution incorporates both American and British constitutional concepts.\n\nThere have been a number of local and national elections since the Republic of the Marshall Islands was founded. The United Democratic Party, running on a reform platform, won the 1999 parliamentary election, taking control of the presidency and cabinet.\n\nThe islands signed a [[Compact of Free Association]] with the United States in 1986. Trusteeship was ended under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 683]] of December 22, 1990. Until 1999 the islanders received [[United States dollar|US$]]180M for continued American use of Kwajalein atoll, US$250M in compensation for [[nuclear test]]ing, and US$600M in other payments under the compact.\n\nDespite the constitution, the government was largely controlled by Iroij.

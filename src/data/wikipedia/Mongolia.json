Its area is roughly equivalent with the historical territory of [[Outer Mongolia]], and that term is sometimes used to refer to the current state.

It is also the world's second-largest landlocked country behind [[Kazakhstan]] and the largest landlocked country that does not border a [[Endorheic basin|closed sea]]. The country contains very little [[arable land]], as much of its area is covered by grassy [[steppe]], with mountains to the north and west and the [[Gobi Desert]] to the south. [[Ulaanbaatar]], the capital and largest city, is home to about 45% of the country's population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mongolia Population 2018 |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mongolia-population/ |website=worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref> Ulaanbaatar also shares the rank of the world's coldest capital city with [[Moscow]], [[Ottawa]], and [[Nur-Sultan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/coldest-capital-now-ottawa-1.4466107|title=Iced cap: Ottawa currently coldest capital city in the world {{!}} CBC News|last=Dec 28|first=CBC News \u00b7 Posted:|last2=December 28|first2=2017 10:24 AM ET {{!}} Last Updated:|website=CBC|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18|last3=2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/the-coldest-capital-cities-in-the-world.html|title=The Coldest Capital Cities In The World|website=WorldAtlas|language=en|access-date=2018-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/coldest-capital-cities-1435314|title=What Is the Coldest Capital City in the World?|last=geography|first=Matt Rosenberg Matt Rosenberg has a masters in|last2=Writer|first2=Is an Award-Winning Freelance|website=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-12-18|last3=Subject|first3=Author of Two Books on the}}</ref>\n\nApproximately 30% of the population is [[nomad]]ic or semi-nomadic; [[Horse culture in Mongolia|horse culture]] is still integral.

The majority of the state's citizens are of Mongol ethnicity, although [[Kazakhs]], [[Tuvans]], and other minorities also live in the country, especially in the west. Mongolia joined the [[World Trade Organization]] in 1997 and seeks to expand its participation in regional economic and trade groups.<ref name=\"cia\"/>\n\nThe area of what is now Mongolia has been ruled by various [[nomadic empire]]s, including the [[Xiongnu]], the [[Xianbei]], the [[Rouran]], the [[Turkic Khaganate]], and others. In 1206, [[Genghis Khan]] founded the [[Mongol Empire]], which became the largest [[List of largest empires|contiguous land empire]] in history. His grandson [[Kublai Khan]] conquered China to establish the [[Yuan dynasty]]. After the collapse of the Yuan, the [[Mongols]] retreated to Mongolia and resumed their earlier pattern of factional conflict, except during the era of [[Dayan Khan]] and [[Tumen Zasagt Khan]].\n\nIn the 16th century, [[Buddhism in Mongolia|Tibetan Buddhism]] began to spread in Mongolia, being further led by the [[Manchu people|Manchu]]-founded [[Qing dynasty]], which absorbed the country in the 17th century. By the early 1900s, almost one-third of the adult male population were Buddhist monks.<ref>Michael Jerryson, ''Mongolian Buddhism: The Rise and Fall of the Sangha,'' (Chiang Mai: Silkworm Books, 2007), 89.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Mongolia \u2013 Religion |url = http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/east_asia/mongolia/religion.htm |website = Michigan State University |accessdate = January 24, 2015 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150315082839/http://asia.isp.msu.edu/wbwoa/east_asia/mongolia/religion.htm |archivedate = March 15, 2015 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> After the collapse of the Qing dynasty in 1911, Mongolia [[Mongolian Revolution of 1911|declared independence]], and achieved actual [[Mongolian Revolution of 1921|independence from the Republic of China]] in 1921.

Monuments of the pre-Xiongnu Bronze Age include [[deer stone]]s, keregsur [[kurgans]], [[Slab Grave Culture|square slab tombs]], and rock paintings.\n\nAlthough cultivation of crops has continued since the Neolithic, agriculture has always remained small in scale compared to pastoral nomadism.

Common institutions were the office of the [[Khan (title)|Khan]], the [[Kurultai]] (Supreme Council), left and right wings, imperial army ([[Keshig]]) and the decimal military system. The first of these empires, the [[Xiongnu]] of undetermined ethnicity, were brought together by [[Modu Shanyu]] to form a confederation in 209 BC. Soon they emerged as the greatest threat to the [[Qin Dynasty]], forcing the latter to construct the [[Great Wall of China]]. It was guarded by up to almost 300,000 soldiers during Marshal [[Meng Tian]]'s tenure, as a means of defense against the destructive Xiongnu raids. The vast Xiongnu empire (209 BC\u201393 AD) was followed by the Mongolic [[Xianbei state|Xianbei empire]] (93\u2013234 AD), which also ruled more than the entirety of present-day Mongolia. The Mongolic [[Rouran]] Khaganate (330\u2013555), of [[Xianbei]] provenance was the first to use \"Khagan\" as an imperial title. It ruled a massive empire before being defeated by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks]] (555\u2013745) whose empire was even bigger.\n\nThe G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks laid siege to [[Panticapaeum]], present-day [[Kerch]], in 576. They were succeeded by the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] (745\u2013840) who were defeated by the Kyrgyz. The Mongolic [[Khitan people|Khitans]], descendants of the Xianbei, ruled Mongolia during the [[Liao Dynasty]] (907\u20131125), after which the [[Khamag Mongol]] (1125\u20131206) rose to prominence.\n\nLines 3\u20135 of the memorial inscription of [[Bilge Khagan]] (684\u2013737) in central Mongolia summarizes the time of the [[Khagan]]s:\n\n{{cquote| In battles they subdued the nations of all four sides of the world and suppressed them.

[[Amban]]s, Manchu \"high officials\", were installed in [[Ulaanbaatar|Kh\u00fcree]], [[Uliastai]], and [[Khovd (city)|Khovd]], and the country was divided into numerous feudal and ecclesiastical fiefdoms (which also placed people in power with loyalty to the Qing). Over the course of the 19th century, the feudal lords attached more importance to representation and less importance to the responsibilities towards their subjects. The behaviour of Mongolia's nobility, together with [[usury|usurious]] practices by Chinese traders and the collection of imperial taxes in silver instead of animals, resulted in widespread poverty among the nomads. By 1911 there were 700 large and small monasteries in Outer Mongolia; their 115,000 monks made up 21% of the population.

Hence, and because of the repeated threats to veto by the ROC, Mongolia did not join the UN until 1961 when the [[Soviet Union]] agreed to lift its veto on the admission of [[Mauritania]] (and any other newly independent African state), in return for the admission of Mongolia. Faced with pressure from nearly all the other African countries, the ROC relented under protest.

The arid conditions in the Gobi are attributed to the [[rain shadow effect]] caused by the Himalayas. Before the Himalayas were formed by the collision of the Indo-Australian plate with the Eurasian plate 10 million years ago, Mongolia was a flourishing habitat for major fauna but still somewhat arid and cold due to distance from sources of evaporation. Sea turtle and mollusk fossils have been found in the Gobi, apart from well-known dinosaur fossils. [[Tadpole shrimps]] (''Lepidurus mongolicus'') are still found in the Gobi today. The eastern part of Mongolia including the [[Onon River|Onon]], [[Kherlen River|Kherlen]] rivers and [[Lake Buir]] form part of the [[Amur river]] basin draining to the Pacific Ocean. It hosts some unique species like the Eastern brook lamprey, Daurian crayfish (''cambaroides dauricus'') and Daurian pearl oyster (''dahurinaia dahurica'') in the Onon/Kherlen rivers as well as Siberian prawn (''exopalaemon modestus'') in Lake Buir.\n[[File:Tuul River in the Gorkhi-Terelj National Park.JPG|thumb|[[Riverine forest]] of the [[Tuul River]] near Ulaanbaatar.]]\n\n== Demographics ==\n<!-- Please, add other images to Commons -->\n{{Main|Demographics of Mongolia}}\n[[File:Chinggis Square.jpg|thumb|[[Ulaanbaatar]] is the capital and largest city of Mongolia]]\n[[File:Yurt in Ulan Bator.JPG|thumb|In settlements, many families live in [[ger district|''ger'' districts]]]]\nMongolia's total population as of January 2015 was estimated by the [[U.S. Census Bureau]]<ref name=\"US Census\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/country/mgportal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211182206/http://www.census.gov/ipc/www/idb/country/mgportal.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-12-11 |title=U.S. Census Bureau International Data Base |date= |accessdate=2013-06-28 }}</ref> to be 3,000,251 people, ranking around 121st in the world.

In the past it was known by the Russian term ''yurt'', but this is changing as the Mongolian term becomes better known among English-speaking countries. According to Mongolian artist and art critic [[N. Chultem]], the ''ger'' was the basis for development of traditional Mongolian architecture. In the 16th and 17th centuries, lamaseries were built throughout the country. Many of them started as ''ger''-temples. When they needed to be enlarged to accommodate the growing number of worshippers, the Mongolian architects used structures with 6 and 12 angles{{clarify|r=is sides or corners meant?|date=April 2011}} with pyramidal roofs to approximate to the round shape of a ''ger''. Further enlargement led to a quadratic shape of the temples. The roofs were made in the shape of marquees.<ref name=\"Chultem\">{{cite book | authorlink = N.

Among the first quadratic temples was Batu-Tsagaan (1654) designed by [[Zanabazar]]. An example of the ''ger''-style architecture is the lamasery Dashi-Choiling in Ulaanbaatar. The temple Lavrin (18th century) in the [[Erdene Zuu]] lamasery was built in the Tibetan tradition. An example of a temple built in the Chinese tradition is the lamasery Choijing Lamiin Sume (1904), which is a museum today. The quadratic temple Tsogchin in lamasery Gandan in Ulaanbaatar is a combination of the Mongolian and Chinese tradition. The temple of Maitreya (disassembled in 1938) is an example of the Tibeto-Mongolian architecture.<ref name=\"Chultem\" /> Dashi-Choiling monastery has commenced a project to restore the temple and the {{convert|25|m|ft}} sculpture of Maitreya.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Mongolia}}\n[[File:Mongolian Musician.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Musician playing the traditional Mongolian musical instrument [[morin khuur]]]]\nThe music of Mongolia is strongly influenced by nature, nomadism, shamanism, and also Tibetan Buddhism. The traditional music includes a variety of instruments, famously the [[morin khuur]], and also the singing styles like the [[Long song|urtyn duu]] (\"long song\"), and throat-singing ([[Tuvan throat singing#Khoomei|khoomei]]). The \"tsam\" is danced to keep away evil spirits and it was seen the reminiscences of shamaning.\n\nThe first rock band of Mongolia was [[Soyol Erdene]], founded in the 1960s. Their [[The Beatles|Beatles]]-like manner was severely criticized by the Communist censorship. It was followed by Mungunhurhree, Ineemseglel, Urgoo, etc., carving out the path for the genre in the harsh environment of Communist ideology. Mungunhurhree and [[Haranga]] were to become the pioneers in the Mongolia's heavy rock music. Haranga approached its zenith in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nThe leader of Haranga, famous guitarist Enh-Manlai, generously helped the growth of the following generations of rockers. Among the followers of Haranga was the band [[Hurd (band)|Hurd]]. In the early 1990s, group Har-Chono put the beginning for Mongolia's folk-rock, merging elements of the Mongolian traditional \"[[long song]]\" into the genre.\n\nBy that time, the environment for development of artistic thought had become largely liberal thanks to the new democratic society in the country.

In modern-day Mongolia, Naadam is held on July 11 to 13 in the honour of the anniversaries of the National Democratic Revolution and foundation of the Great Mongol State.\n\nAnother very popular activity called Shagaa is the \"flicking\" of sheep ankle bones at a target several feet away, using a flicking motion of the finger to send the small bone flying at targets and trying to knock the target bones off the platform. At Naadam, this contest is very popular and develops a serious audience among older Mongolians.\n[[File:Three Naadam riders.jpg|thumb|left|Riders during [[Naadam]] festival]]\n\n[[Horse culture in Mongolia|Horse riding]] is especially central to Mongolian culture. The long-distance races that are showcased during Naadam festivals are one aspect of this, as is the popularity of trick riding. One example of trick riding is the legend that the Mongolian military hero [[Damdin S\u00fckhbaatar]] scattered coins on the ground and then picked them up while riding a horse at full gallop.\n\n[[File:Mongolskie zapasy na lokalnym festiwalu Naadam (24).jpg|thumb|Traditional [[Mongolian wrestling]]]]\n[[Mongolian wrestling]] is the most popular of all Mongol sports. It is the highlight of the Three Manly Games of Naadam. Historians claim that Mongol-style wrestling originated some seven thousand years ago. Hundreds of wrestlers from different cities and aimags around the country take part in the national wrestling competition.\n\nOther sports such as basketball, [[Olympic weightlifting|weightlifting]], [[powerlifting]], and association football, athletics, gymnastics, table tennis, [[jujutsu]], [[karate]], [[aikido]], [[kickboxing]], [[mixed martial arts]] have become popular in Mongolia.

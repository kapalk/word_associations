Taiwan is the most populous state and largest [[Gross domestic product|economy]] that is not a member of the [[United Nations]] (UN).\n\nThe [[Geography of Taiwan|island of Taiwan]] was inhabited by [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples|indigenous peoples]] for thousands of years before the 17th century, when [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch colonialists]] opened the island to mass [[Han people|Han]] immigration. After a brief rule by the [[Kingdom of Tungning]], the island was annexed in 1683 by the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and ceded to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1895. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] in 1945, the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], which had overthrown and succeeded the Qing in 1911, took control of Taiwan. The resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] led to the loss of the mainland to the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] and the flight of the ROC government to Taiwan in 1949. Although the ROC government continued to claim to be the [[Two Chinas|legitimate representative of China]], since 1950 its effective jurisdiction has been limited to [[Free area of the Republic of China|Taiwan and several small islands]]. In the early 1960s, Taiwan entered a period of [[Taiwan Miracle|rapid economic growth]] and [[industrialisation]]. In the 1980s and early 1990s, it changed from a one-party military dictatorship to a multi-party democracy with a [[semi-presidential system]].\n\nAs a founding member, the ROC represented China in the UN until it was replaced by the PRC in 1971. The PRC has consistently claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognises the ROC. As of 2019, Taiwan maintains [[Foreign relations of Taiwan|official ties]] with 16 out of 193 UN member states. Most international organisations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a [[non-state actor]]. Nevertheless, most major powers maintain unofficial ties with Taiwan through [[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office|representative offices]] and institutions that function as ''de facto'' embassies and consulates. In Taiwan, the major political division is between parties favouring eventual [[Chinese unification]] and promoting a Chinese identity contrasted with those aspiring to [[Taiwan independence movement|independence]] and promoting a [[Taiwanese nationalism|Taiwanese identity]], though both sides have moderated their positions to broaden their appeal.<ref>{{cite book |title=Party Politics in Taiwan |given=Dafydd |surname=Fell |publisher=Routledge |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-134-24021-0 |page=85 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |given1=Christopher H. |surname1=Achen |given2=T.

The area occupied by modern-day Tainan represented the first permanent settlement by both European colonists and Chinese immigrants. The settlement grew to be the island's most important trading centre and served as its capital until 1887. Use of the current Chinese name ({{lang|zh-hant|{{linktext|\u81fa\u7063}}}}) became official as early as 1684 with the establishment of [[Taiwan Prefecture]].

The Qing imperial government tried to reduce piracy and vagrancy in the area, issuing a series of edicts to manage immigration and respect aboriginal land rights. Immigrants mostly from southern Fujian continued to enter Taiwan. The border between taxpaying lands and what was considered \"savage\" lands shifted eastward, with some aborigines becoming [[sinicized]] while others retreated into the mountains. During this time, there were a number of conflicts between groups of [[Han Chinese]] from different regions of southern Fujian, particularly between those from [[Quanzhou]] and [[Zhangzhou]], and between southern Fujian Chinese and aborigines.\n\nNorthern Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were the scene of subsidiary campaigns in the [[Sino-French War]] (August 1884 to April 1885). The French occupied Keelung on 1 October 1884, but were [[Battle of Tamsui|repulsed from Tamsui]] a few days later. The French won some tactical victories but were unable to exploit them, and the [[Keelung Campaign]] ended in stalemate. The [[Pescadores Campaign]], beginning on 31 March 1885, was a French victory, but had no long-term consequences. The French evacuated both Keelung and the Penghu archipelago after the end of the war.\n\nIn 1887, the Qing upgraded the island's administration from [[Taiwan Prefecture]] of Fujian Province to [[Taiwan Province#History|Fujian-Taiwan-Province]], the twentieth in the empire, with its capital at [[Taipei]].

The upper part of the crust on the island is primarily made up of a series of [[terrane]]s, mostly old [[island arc]]s which have been forced together by the collision of the forerunners of the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. These have been further uplifted as a result of the detachment of a portion of the Eurasian Plate as it was [[subduction|subducted]] beneath remnants of the Philippine Sea Plate, a process which left the crust under Taiwan more buoyant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/~anderson/taiwan/tai_index.html |title=Geology of Taiwan |publisher=University of Arizona |accessdate=1 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe east and south of Taiwan are a complex system of belts formed by, and part of the zone of, active collision between the North Luzon Trough portion of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc]] and South China, where accreted portions of the [[Luzon Volcanic Arc|Luzon Arc]] and Luzon forearc form the [[Haian Range|eastern Coastal Range]] and parallel inland [[Huatung Valley|Longitudinal Valley]] of Taiwan respectively.<ref>Clift, Schouten and Draut (2003) in ''Intra-Oceanic Subduction Systems: Tectonic and Magmatic Processes'', {{ISBN|1-86239-147-5}} p84\u201386</ref>\n\nThe major seismic faults in Taiwan correspond to the various suture zones between the various [[terrane]]s. These have produced major quakes throughout the history of the island. On 21 September 1999, a 7.3 quake known as the \"[[1999 Jiji (Chichi) earthquake|921 earthquake]]\" killed more than 2,400 people.

Political reforms beginning in the late 1970s and continuing through the early 1990s liberalized the country and transformed into a multiparty democracy. Since the lifting of martial law, the Republic of China has democratized and reformed, suspending constitutional components that were originally meant for the whole of China. This process of amendment continues. In 2000, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) won the [[President of the Republic of China|presidency]], ending KMT's continuous control of the government. In May 2005, a new National Assembly was elected to reduce the number of parliamentary seats and implement several constitutional reforms. These reforms have been passed; the National Assembly has essentially voted to abolish itself and transfer the power of constitutional reform to the popular ballot.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Taiwan assembly passes changes |date=7 June 2005 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4616043.stm}}</ref>\n[[File:Presidential Building, Taiwan (0747).JPG|thumb|Taiwan's popularly elected president resides in the [[Presidential Office Building, Taipei]], originally built in the Japanese era for colonial governors.]]\nThe [[head of state]] and commander-in-chief of the [[Republic of China Armed Forces|armed forces]] is the [[President of the Republic of China|president]], who is elected by popular vote for a maximum of 2 four-year terms on the same ticket as the vice-president.

Another significant fraction descends from Han Chinese who immigrated from mainland China in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The shared cultural origin combined with several hundred years of geographical separation, some hundred years of political separation and foreign influences, as well as hostility between the rival ROC and PRC have resulted in national identity being a contentious issue with political overtones. Since democratization and the lifting of martial law, a distinct Taiwanese identity (as opposed to Taiwanese identity as a subset of a Chinese identity) is often at the heart of political debates. Its acceptance makes the island distinct from mainland China, and therefore may be seen as a step towards forming a consensus for ''de jure'' Taiwan independence.<ref name=\"power-shift\">{{Cite book|last=Shambaugh|first=David L.|title=Power shift|publisher=University of California Press|year=2006|pages=179\u2013183 |isbn=978-0-520-24570-9}}</ref> The [[pan-green]] camp supports a distinct Taiwanese identity, while the [[pan-blue]] camp supports a Chinese identity only.<ref name=\"panblue-reunif-chineseid\" /> The KMT has downplayed this stance in the recent years and now supports a Taiwanese identity as part of a Chinese identity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/eo20081230ho.html|title=No sign of a 'peace agreement'|last=Okazaki|first=Hisahiko|date=30 December 2008|newspaper=Japan Times|accessdate=15 July 2009|quote=For one thing, I believe there is recognition that the awareness of Taiwanese identity is now irreversible.

When the [[People's Liberation Army]] won the [[Chinese Civil War]], much of the National Revolutionary Army retreated to Taiwan along with the government. It was later reformed into the Republic of China Army. Units which surrendered and remained in mainland China were either disbanded or incorporated into the People's Liberation Army.\n\nToday, Taiwan maintains a large and technologically advanced military, mainly as defence against the constant threat of invasion by the [[People's Liberation Army]] under the [[Anti-Secession Law of the People's Republic of China]].

On a [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) basis, its GDP per capita in the early 1960s was $1,353 (in 1990 prices). By 2011 per-capita GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), had risen to $37,000, contributing to a [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) equivalent to that of other developed countries.

The latter numbers years starting from 1911, the year of the founding of the Republic of China. For example, 2007 was the \"96th year of the Republic\" (\u6c11\u570b96\u5e74),<ref>{{cite web|author=Lotta Danielsson-Murphy |url=http://www.us-taiwan.org/taiwan_holidays.html |title=Taiwan Calendar and Holidays |publisher=US-Taiwan Business Council |accessdate=28 May 2009}}</ref> while its months and days were numbered according to the Gregorian calendar.\n\nUsually, year numbering may use the Gregorian system as well as the ROC era system. For example, 3 May 2004, may be written 2004-05-03 or 93-05-03. The use of two different calendar systems in Taiwan may be confusing, in particular for foreigners. For instance, products for export marked using the Minguo calendar can be misunderstood as having an expiration date 11&nbsp;years earlier than intended.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2006/02/25/2003294523 |title=Taiwan may drop idiosyncratic Republican calendar|newspaper=Taipei Times |date=25 February 2006 |accessdate=28 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nTaiwan also uses the [[Chinese calendar|lunar calendar]] for traditional festivals such as the [[Chinese New Year]], the [[Lantern Festival]], and the [[Dragon Boat Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/index_e.htm |title=Holidays and Festivals in Taiwan |publisher=Government Information Office, ROC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009021955/http://www.gio.gov.tw/info/festival_c/index_e.htm |archivedate=9 October 2009  }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal |Taiwan|Islands}}\n* [[Index of Taiwan-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Taiwan]]\n* [[Taiwan, China]]\n* [[Taiwan Province, People's Republic of China]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Works cited ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://doit.moea.gov.tw/itech/data/2008_1_1_EN.pdf|title=2008 White Paper on Taiwan Industrial Technology|year=2008|publisher=Department of Industrial Technology|ref={{Sfnref|DoIT|2008}}|accessdate=27 November 2009}}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last=Bird | first=Michael I\n  | last2=Hope | first2=Geoffrey | last3=Taylor | first3=David\n  | year=2004\n  | title=Populating PEP II: the dispersal of humans and agriculture through Austral-Asia and Oceania\n  | url=http://palaeoworks.anu.edu.au/pubs/Birdetal04.pdf\n  | journal=Quaternary International | volume=118\u2013119\n  | pages=145\u2013163\n  | doi=10.1016/s1040-6182(03)00135-6\n  |ref=harv\n| accessdate=31 March 2007\n  | bibcode=2004QuInt.118..145B\n  }}\n* {{cite book |title=Cultural, Ethnic, and Political Nationalism in Contemporary Taiwan: Bentuhua |last=Chang |first=Maukuei |date=2005 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-4039-7020-6 |edition=1 |location=New York |chapter=Chapter 7 : The Movement to Indigenize to Social Sciences in Taiwan: Origin and Predicaments |ref=harv|editor1-last=Makeham |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Hsiau |editor2-first=A-chin }}\n* {{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/islandofformosap00davi |title=The Island of Formosa, Past and Present : history, people, resources, and commercial prospects : tea, camphor, sugar, gold, coal, sulphur, economical plants, and other productions |publisher=Macmillan |year=1903 |location=London and New York |ol=6931635M |ref=harv|last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |authorlink=James W.

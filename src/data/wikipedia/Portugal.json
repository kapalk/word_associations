The [[pre-Celtic]] people, [[Celts]], [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Visigoths]] and [[Suebi]] [[Germanic peoples]]. Portugal as a country was established during the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'' against the [[Moors]] who had invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 711 AD. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained independence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] in 1128. The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] in 1139 and was recognised by the neighbouring kingdoms by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] in 1143.<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

At the time the land of a specific people was frequently named after its deity. Those names are the origins of the -''gal'' in ''Portugal'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''. Incidentally, the meaning of ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is also a derivation of the Celtic word for port which would confirm very old links to pre-Roman, Celtic languages which compare to today's Irish ''caladh'' or Scottish ''cala'', both meaning port. Some French scholars believe it may have come from 'Portus Gallus',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&source=bl&ots=ir3OkpgQcI&sig=LzkcSY11hCzCrAgSrubkwJgy9jk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL2ZLCn_TYAhUYM8AKHXB8A3kQ6AEINTAC#v=onepage&q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&f=false|title=Manuel g\u00e9ographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}</ref> the port of the Gauls or Celts.\n\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale and renamed it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'' or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n[[File:Aroeira3.jpg|thumb|[[Aroeira 3]] skull of 400,000 year old ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'', the oldest trace of human history in Portugal.]]\n{{ multiple image\n | direction =    vertical \n | width = \n | footer = \n | image1 = Citania briteiros casa 2.jpg\n | caption1 we=  \n | image2 = Ch%C3%A3o_cividade_terroso.JPG\n | caption2 = Reconstructed house in [[Cit\u00e2nia de Briteiros]] (up) and paved yard in [[Cividade de Terroso]] (down), examples of [[Castro culture|Celtic Castro Culture]] of [[Northern Portugal]] ([[9th century BC]] \u2013 [[1st century]].\n }}\n[[File:Centro_de_Alcalar_2017_-_Monumento_9_-_Entrada_(cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar]], built in the [[3rd millennium BC]] Southern Portugal, now the [[Algarve]].]]\n\n{{Main|History of Portugal}}\n\nThe early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in South Western Europe. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]], after 45 BC until 298 AD.\n\nThe region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.<ref name=\"Birmp1\">David Birmingham (2003), p. 11</ref> These were subsistence societies that, although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did form organized societies. Neolithic Portugal experimented with domestication of herding animals, the raising of some cereal crops and fluvial or marine fishing.<ref name=Birmp1/>\n\nIt is believed by some scholars that early in the first millennium BC, several waves of [[Celts]] invaded Portugal from [[Central Europe]] and inter-married with the local populations, forming [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|different tribes]]. Modern archeology and research shows a Portuguese root to the Celts in Portugal and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web | title= Our Celtic roots lie in Spain and Portugal | url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/celtic-roots-lie-spain-portugal-2174486| accessdate=11 April 2017 | publisher = Walles Online | author= Devine, Darren}}</ref> During that period and until the Roman invasions, the Castro culture (a variation of the [[Urnfield culture]] aka ''Urnenfelderkultur'') was prolific in Portugal and modern Galicia.<ref>Estos se establecieron en el norte de Portugal y el \u00e1rea de la [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] actual, introduciendo en esta regi\u00f3n la cultura de las urnas, una variante de las Urnenfelder que evolucionar\u00eda despu\u00e9s en la cultura de los castros o castre\u00f1a</ref>\nThis culture, together with the surviving elements of the Atlantic megalithic culture and the contributions that come from the more Western Mediterranean cultures, end up in what has been called the '''Cultura Castreja''' or [[Castro Culture]].

The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, main referring medical and religious that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events. \nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] or [[Pliny the Elder]], among others about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nOther similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]], with the core area of these people lying in inland central Portugal, numerous other related tribes existed such as  the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the [[1st century CE]].]]\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The Lusitanians and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated, and Tautalus became leader.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the Visigothic era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) all over modern Portugal and remains of [[Castro culture]].\nNumerous Roman sites are scattered around present-day Portugal, some urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]] which by its turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''). The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circus, theatres and layman's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some of which coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics were also found.

In 448 R\u00e9chila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy. \nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings: \n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and Remismundo (son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\n\nAfter the death of [[Remismund]] (Remismundo) in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholicism]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemar]] or Theodemir (Teodomiro 559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (de correctione rusticorum) under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n[[File:Reino suevo.svg|thumb|200px|left|Map of 5th- and 6th-century [[Kingdom of the Suebi]]]]\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation the Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom. \n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and Gallia Narbonensis.\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths. Under the Visigoths, Gallaecia was a well-defined space governed by a doge of its own. Doges at this time were related to the monarchy acted as princes in all matters. Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (and would end up being kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\n\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\n \nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal. \nBracara (Augusta), the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This occupation lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 711, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north. Most of Portugal fell into the hands of the [[Taifa of Badajoz]] of the [[Aftasid Dynasty]], and after a short spell of an ephemeral [[Taifa of Lisbon]] in 1022, fell under the dominion of the [[Taifa of Seville]] of the [[Abbadids]] poets.

This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\nAfonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]]. Afonso was recognized in 1143 by King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], and in 1179 by [[Pope Alexander III]].\n\nDuring the [[Reconquista]] period, Christians reconquered the Iberian Peninsula from [[Moors|Moorish]] domination. Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.\n\nIn one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (which was represented, when being a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]].

Over time, this went far beyond geo-political and military cooperation (protecting both nations' interests in Africa, the Americas and Asia against French, Spanish and Dutch rivals) and maintained strong trade and cultural ties between the two old European allies.

A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by [[John I of Portugal|John of Aviz]] (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General [[Nuno \u00c1lvares Pereira]] defeated the Castilians in the [[Battle of Aljubarrota]]. With this battle, the [[House of Aviz]] became the ruling house of Portugal.\n\nPortugal spearheaded European exploration of the world and the [[Age of Discovery]]. Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], son of [[John I of Portugal|King Jo\u00e3o I]], became the main sponsor and patron of this endeavour. During this period, Portugal explored the [[Atlantic Ocean]], discovering several Atlantic archipelagos like the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], and [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], explored the African coast, colonized selected areas of Africa, discovered an eastern [[Portuguese India Armadas|route to India]] via the [[Cape of Good Hope]], [[Colonial Brazil#Discovery and early exploitation|discovered Brazil]], explored the [[Indian Ocean]], established trading routes throughout most of southern Asia, and sent the first direct European maritime trade and diplomatic missions to [[Jorge \u00c1lvares|China]] and [[Nanban trade|Japan]].\n\nIn 1415, Portugal acquired the first of its overseas colonies by conquering [[Ceuta]], the first prosperous Islamic trade centre in North Africa. There followed the first discoveries in the Atlantic: [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], which led to the first [[colonialism|colonization]] movements.\n\nThroughout the 15th century, [[European exploration of Africa#Portuguese|Portuguese explorers]] sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for [[Economic history of Portugal#Expansion of the Portuguese empire (15th and 16th centuries)|several common types of tradable commodities at the time]], ranging from [[gold]] to [[slavery|slaves]], as they looked for a route to India and its [[spice]]s, which were coveted in Europe.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], intended to resolve the dispute that had been created following the return of [[Christopher Columbus]], was made by [[Pope Alexander VI]], the mediator between Portugal and Spain.

From 1595 to 1663 the [[Dutch-Portuguese War]] primarily involved the Dutch companies invading many Portuguese [[colonies]] and commercial interests in Brazil, Africa, India and the Far East, resulting in the loss of the Portuguese Indian sea trade monopoly.\n[[File:John V of Portugal Pompeo Batoni.jpg|thumb|right|upright|King [[John V of Portugal|John V]] patronized numerous artistic works, earning him the epithet of the ''Portuguese Sun King''.]]\nIn 1640, [[John IV of Portugal|John IV]] spearheaded an uprising backed by disgruntled nobles and was proclaimed king. The [[Portuguese Restoration War]] ended the sixty-year period of the [[Iberian Union]] under the [[House of Habsburg]]. This was the beginning of the [[House of Braganza]], which reigned in Portugal until 1910.\n\nKing John IV's eldest son came to reign as [[Afonso VI of Portugal|Afonso VI]], however his physical and mental disabilities left him overpowered by [[Lu\u00eds de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor]]. In a palace coup organized by the King's wife, [[Maria Francisca of Savoy]], and his brother, [[Peter II of Portugal|Pedro, Duke of Beja]], King Afonso VI was declared mentally incompetent and exiled first to the Azores and then to the [[Sintra National Palace|Royal Palace of Sintra]], outside Lisbon. After Afonso's death, Pedro came to the throne as King Pedro II. Pedro's reign saw the consolidation of national independence, imperial expansion, and investment in domestic production.\n\nPedro II's son, [[John V of Portugal|John V]], saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury, supplied largely by the [[royal fifth]] (a tax on precious metals) that was received from the [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese colonies]] of [[State of Brazil|Brazil]] and [[State of Maranh\u00e3o (colonial)|Maranh\u00e3o]].

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects in Portugal.\n\nBut Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\nDisaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when [[Lisbon]] was struck by [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|a violent earthquake]] with an estimated [[Moment magnitude scale|moment magnitude]] of 8.5\u20139.

The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=300\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy. Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.\n\nIn 1762, [[Spanish\u2013Portuguese War, 1761\u20131763|Spain invaded Portuguese territory]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]], but by 1763 the ''status quo'' between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.\n\nFollowing the T\u00e1vora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made \"Marquis of Pombal\" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779.\n\nThe new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the T\u00e1vora family, and upon her accession to the throne, she withdrew all his political offices. The Marquis of Pombal died on his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] in 1782.\n\nHowever, historians also argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment,\" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.<ref>Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91\u2013108, 160\u201362.</ref>\n\n=== Napoleonic era ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1777\u20131834)|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width = \n | footer = \n | image1 = Autor n\u00e3o identificado - Embarque da Fam\u00edlia Real Portuguesa.jpg\n | caption1 = The [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|Departure of the Portuguese Royal Court to Brazil]] in 1808\n | image2 = Alegoria \u00e0s virtudes do Pr\u00edncipe Regente D.

This decline was hastened by the [[independence of Brazil]], the country's largest colonial possession.\n\nIn the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]], during which the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].\n\nIn 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, the [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]], the [[Prince Regent]], transferred his court to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental State, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].\n\n[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]\nAs a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Jo\u00e3o VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.\n\nThus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]. However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width = \n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II  (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese Africa territories had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese Africa's cities and towns like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]], [[Lobito]], [[Jo\u00e3o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Am\u00e9lia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, the King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa|Alfredo Luis da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, big anger protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal.\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal was one of only five European countries to remain neutral in [[World War II]]. \nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km\u00b2.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war map1.PNG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], [[The Economist]] (16 August 1975).</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], [[Time Magazine]] (7 July 1975).</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugee]]s fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[Portuguese Constituent Assembly election, 1975|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[Portuguese legislative election, 1976|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a highly charged ideological document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty; it was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt|borrowing costs]] in the wake of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer = \n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

Six hundred bird species occur in Portugal (either for nesting or during the course of migration), and annually there are new registries of nesting species. The archipelagos of the Azores and Madeira are transient stopover for American, European, and African birds, while continental Portugal mostly encounters European and African bird species.\n\nThere are more than 100 freshwater fish species, varying from the giant European catfish (in the Tagus International Natural Park) to some small and endemic species that live only in small lakes (along the western portion of country, for example). Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. [[Marine fish]] species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]]. Bioluminescent species are also well represented (including species in different colour spectrum and forms), like the glowing plankton that are possible to observe in some beaches.\n\nThere are many endemic insect species, most only found in certain parts of Portugal, while other species are more widespread like the [[stag beetle]] (''Lucanus cervus'') and the [[cicada]]. The [[Macaronesia]]n islands (Azores and Madeira) have many endemic species (like birds, reptiles, bats, insects, snails and slugs) that evolved independently from other regions of Portugal.

The Assembly of the Republic, Regional Assemblies and local municipalities and parishes, are dominated by two political parties, the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|Social Democratic Party]], in addition to the [[Unitary Democratic Coalition]] ([[Portuguese Communist Party]] and [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"]]), the [[Left Bloc]] and the [[Democratic and Social Centre&nbsp;\u2013 People's Party]], which garner between 5 and 15% of the vote regularly.\n\n=== Presidency of the Republic ===\n[[File:Portugal (17135381862).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Bel\u00e9m Palace]] serves as the official residence and workplace of the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]].]]\n{{main|President of Portugal|List of Presidents of Portugal}}\nThe Head of State of Portugal is the [[President of Portugal|President of the Republic]], elected to a five-year term by direct, [[universal suffrage]]. He or she has also supervision and [[reserve power]]s. Presidential powers include the appointment of the Prime Minister and the other members of the Government (where the President takes into account the results of legislative elections); dismissing the Prime Minister; dissolving the Assembly of the Republic (to call early elections); [[veto]]ing legislation (which may be overridden by the Assembly); and declaring a state of war or siege. The President is also the ''[[ex officio]]'' Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe President is advised on issues of importance by the [[Portuguese Council of State|Council of State]], which is composed of six senior civilian officers, any former Presidents elected under the 1976 Constitution, five-members chosen by the Assembly, and five selected by the president.\n\n=== Government ===\n{{main|Government of Portugal|Prime Minister of Portugal|List of Prime Ministers of Portugal}}\n[[File:Lisbon holiday (18607400288).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Pra\u00e7a do Com\u00e9rcio]] houses multiple ministries of the [[Government of Portugal]].]]\nThe Government is headed by the presidentially appointed [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]], also including one or more Deputy Prime Ministers, Ministers, Secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries of State.\n\nThe Government is both the organ of sovereignty that conducts the general politics of the country and the superior body of the public administration.\n\nIt has essentially Executive powers, but has also limited Legislative powers. The Government can legislate about its own organization, about areas covered by legislative authorizations conceded by the Assembly of the Republic and about the specific regulation of generalist laws issued by the Assembly.\n\nThe [[Council of Ministers (Portugal)|Council of Ministers]] \u2013 under the presidency of the Prime Minister (or the President of Portugal at the latter's request) and the Ministers (may also include one or more Deputy Prime Ministers) \u2013 acts as the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Each government is required to define the broad outline of its policies in a programme, and present it to the Assembly for a mandatory period of debate. The failure of the Assembly to reject the government programme by an absolute majority of deputies confirms the cabinet in office.\n\n=== Parliament ===\n[[File:Lisbon, Portugal (Sharon Hahn Darlin) S\u00e3o Bento.jpg|thumb|250px|[[S\u00e3o Bento Palace]] is the seat of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portuguese Legislature]].]]\n{{main|Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|List of political parties in Portugal}}\nThe [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]], in Lisbon is the national [[parliament]] of Portugal. It is the main Legislative body, although the Government also has limited legislative powers.\n\nThe Assembly of the Republic is a unicameral body composed of up to 230 deputies. Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.\n\nCurrently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats. The [[Social Democratic Party (Portugal)|PSD]] and [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|CDS-PP]] parties form the opposition to the government alongside a single seat held by [[People\u2013Animals\u2013Nature|PAN]].\n\n=== Law and drug policy ===\n[[File:Pal\u00e1cio Palmela 7948.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of the Dukes of Palmela|Palmela Palace]], seat of the Portuguese Attorney-General's Office.]]\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main article: \"Law of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{main|Judiciary of Portugal|Law of Portugal|Drug policy of Portugal|LGBT rights in Portugal}}\nThe Portuguese legal system is part of the civil law legal system, also called the continental family legal system. The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese law applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continues to be the major influence for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels.

A small number of the former Jews may have continued to observe rabbinic Judaism in secret over many generations, in the case of the secret [[History of the Jews in Belmonte|Jews of Belmonte]], a small town in the interior; where now people observe the Jewish faith openly. After 1772 the distinction between Old and New Christians was abolished by decree. Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]]. Another interesting demographic feature relates to the Scandinavian expansion towards the West and strong activity in Northern Portugal where it is believed some coastline communities kept Scandinavian ancestry in [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Porto District|Porto]] and [[Braga District|Braga]] regions.\n\nThe most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in [[Paleolithic]] peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago. All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic. Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmc=1852743 | year=2007 | last1=Bauchet | first1=M | last2=McEvoy | first2=B | last3=Pearson | first3=LN | last4=Quillen | first4=EE | last5=Sarkisian | first5=T | last6=Hovhannesyan | first6=K | last7=Deka | first7=R | last8=Bradley | first8=DG | last9=Shriver | first9=MD | title=Measuring European Population Stratification with Microarray Genotype Data | volume=80 | issue=5 | pages=948\u2013956 | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | doi=10.1086/513477 | pmid=17436249 }}</ref> Portuguese people have a preponderancy of Iberian genetics (Iron Age Period)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|title=Eupedia Autosomal Maps|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which belong to R1b haplogroup family alongside with [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]], [[Alpine states|Alpine]] and [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] genetical markers.

Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Hospital Geral de Santo Ant\u00f3nio (14027237313).jpg\n | image2 = Hospital de Santa Maria.jpg\n | footer = Santo Ant\u00f3nio Hospital, in [[Porto]] (above), and Santa Maria Hospital, in Lisbon (bottom).\n }}\nAccording to the latest [[Human Development Report]], the average [[life expectancy]] in 2015 was 81.3 years.<ref>[[List of countries by life expectancy]]</ref>\n\nPortugal ranks 12th in the best public health systems in the world, ahead of high developed countries like the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]] or [[Sweden]].<ref>[[World Health Organization ranking of health systems in 2000]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://countryeconomy.com/demography/life-expectancy/portugal|title=Portugal \u2013 Life expectancy at birth 2015|website=Countryeconomy.com|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Portuguese health system is characterized by three coexisting systems: the National Health Service (''Servi\u00e7o Nacional de Sa\u00fade'', SNS), special social health insurance schemes for certain professions (health subsystems) and voluntary private health insurance. The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS.\nFive regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cancer of the cervix and the prostate are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] has dropped sharply since the late 1970s, when 24 of 1000 newborns died in the first year of life. It is now around 2 deaths per a 1000 newborns. This improvement was mainly due to the decrease in neonatal mortality, from 15.5 to 2.4 per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at the household level complement other data on health status and the use of services.\n\nOnly one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 }}.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a potato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]) and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is the arroz de sarrabulho (rice stewed in pigs blood) or the arroz de cabidela (rice and chickens meat stewed in chickens blood).\n[[File:Rabelo_Douro_en%E2%80%93Porto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Portuguese wine]] is well-known, such as [[Port wine]] (being transported here into [[Porto]]).]] \nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].

The traditional one is the Portuguese folk music which has deep roots in local costumes having as instruments bagpipes, drums, flutes, tambourines, accordions and small guitars (''cavaquinho''). Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of [[Fado]], a melancholic urban music originated in [[Lisbon]] in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of \"[[troubadour]] serenading\" fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[Jos\u00e9 Afonso]], [[Mariza]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Chainho]], [[M\u00edsia]], [[Dulce Pontes]] and [[Madredeus]].\n\nIn the classical music domain, Portugal is represented by names as the pianists [[Artur Pizarro]], [[Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires]], [[Sequeira Costa]], the violinists Carlos Damas, [[Gerardo Ribeiro]] and in the past by the great cellist [[Guilhermina Suggia]]. Notable composers include [[Jos\u00e9 Vianna da Motta]], [[Carlos Seixas]], [[Jo\u00e3o Domingos Bomtempo]], [[Jo\u00e3o de Sousa Carvalho]], [[Lu\u00eds de Freitas Branco]] and his student [[Joly Braga Santos]], [[Fernando Lopes-Gra\u00e7a]], [[Emmanuel Nunes]] and [[S\u00e9rgio Azevedo]].

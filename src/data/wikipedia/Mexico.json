The Kingdom of New Spain was created from the remnants of the Aztec hegemonic empire. Subsequent enlargements, such as the conquest of the [[Tarascan state]], resulted in the creation of the Viceroyalty of New Spain in 1535. The Viceroyalty at its greatest extent included the territories of modern Mexico, Central America as far south as Costa Rica, and the western United States. The Viceregal capital Mexico City also administrated the [[Spanish West Indies]] (the [[Caribbean]]), the [[Spanish East Indies]] (the [[Philippines]]), and [[Spanish Florida]].\n\nThe indigenous population stabilized around one to one and a half million individuals in the 17th century from the most commonly accepted five to ten million [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|pre-contact population]].

The [[Academy of San Carlos]] was the first major school and museum of art in the Americas. Scientist [[Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo Fern\u00e1ndez]] discovered the element [[vanadium]].\n\nSpanish forces, sometimes accompanied by native allies, led expeditions to conquer territory or quell rebellions through the colonial era. Notable Amerindian revolts in sporadically populated northern New Spain include the [[Chichimeca War]] (1576\u20131606), [[Tepehu\u00e1n Revolt]] (1616\u20131620) and the [[Pueblo Revolt]] (1680). To protect Mexico from the attacks of English, French and Dutch [[pirates]] and protect the Crown's monopoly of revenue, only two ports were open to foreign trade\u2014Veracruz on the Atlantic and Acapulco on the Pacific.

With limited trade, the people had difficulty meeting tax payments and resented the central government's actions in collecting customs. Resentment built up from California to Texas. Both the mission system and the ''[[presidios]]'' had collapsed after the Spanish withdrew from the colony, causing great disruption especially in Alta California and New Mexico. The people in the borderlands had to raise local militias to protect themselves from hostile Native Americans.

They allowed for religious freedom for the new settlers, who were primarily Protestant English speakers from the United States. Within several years, the Anglos far outnumbered the [[Tejano]] in the area. Itinerant traders traveled through the area, working by free market principles. The Tejano grew more separate from the government and due to its neglect, many supported the idea of independence and joined movements to that end, collaborating with the English-speaking Americans.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nGeneral [[Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna]], a centralist and two-time dictator, approved the [[Siete Leyes]] in 1836, a radical amendment that institutionalized the centralized form of government.

[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos]] noted in his writings that there should be no tolerance for any other religion and the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|Constitution of 1824]] declared that the official religion of the Republic would be Catholic, and from the second half of the 20th century, began a process of introducing creeds different from the Catholic.\n\nThe 1920s was marked by a religious conflict known as the [[Cristero War]], in which many peasants encouraged by the clergy clashed with the federal government that had decided to enforce the constitutional laws of 1917. Among the measures contemplated by the Magna Carta were the suppression of the [[Monasticism|monastic orders]] and the cancellation of all religious worship. The war ended with an agreement between the parties in conflict ([[Catholic Church]] and State), by means of which the respective fields of action were defined. Until the middle of the 1990s, the Mexican constitution did not recognize the existence of any religious group. In 1993, a law was enacted whereby the State granted them legal status as \"religious associations\". This fact allowed the reestablishment of diplomatic relations with the [[Holy See]], to which the Mexican State did not recognize as a political entity.\n\nAccording to the figures of [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|INEGI]], most Mexicans declare themselves [[Christianity|Christian]] and most [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (almost 93 million adherents according to the census of 2010).<ref name=\"2010-census\" />\nThe second Christian group is the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], which totals more than 1&nbsp;million adherents, making the Mexican congregation of this Christian branch the second worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Thirdly find [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], whose members are known as [[Latter Day Saint movement|Mormons]], 2010 census reported 314,932 members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,<ref name=\"2010-census\"/> though the church in 2009 claimed to have over one million registered members;<ref name=\"lds-Mexico\">{{cite web|title=Mexico, Country profile|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-Days Saints Newsroom|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/mexico|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825063153/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/contact-us/mexico|archivedate=August 25, 2010|accessdate=March 4, 2011}}</ref> followed by [[La Luz del Mundo|Church of the La Luz del Mundo]], which has its center in \"[[La Hermosa Provincia]]\", a colony of [[Guadalajara]]. The denominations [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] also have an important presence, especially in the cities of the border and in the indigenous communities. In fact, Pentecostal churches together have more than 1.3 million adherents, which in net numbers place them as the second Christian creed in Mexico. The situation changes when the different Pentecostal denominations are considered as separate entities. Other groups are growing, such as [[Iglesia apost\u00f3lica de la Fe en Cristo Jes\u00fas]], [[Mennonites in Mexico|Mennonites]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. Migratory phenomena have led to the proliferation of different aspects of Christianity, including branches [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]].\n\nAccording to [[Jacobo Grinberg-Zylberbaum]] (in texts edited by the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]), it is remarkable the survival of magic-religious rituals of the old [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] groups, not only in the current indigenous people but in the [[mestizo]]s and [[white people|whites]] that make up the Mexican rural and urban society. There is often a [[syncretism]] between [[shamanism]] and the Catholic tradition. Another religion of popular syncretism in Mexico (especially in recent years) is the [[Santer\u00eda]]. This is mainly due to the large number of Cubans who settled in the territory after the [[Cuban Revolution]] (mainly in states such as [[Veracruz]] and [[Yucat\u00e1n]]). Although Mexico was also a recipient of black slaves from [[Africa]] in the 16th century, the apogee of these cults is relatively new.<ref>{{Book cite| author = Jacobo Grinberg Zylberbaum | title = Los chamanes de M\u00e9xico | date = 1989 | publisher = UNAM School of Psychology | location = Mexico City | isbn = 9686022015 | edition = University of Texas | url = https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=1QVZAAAAMAAJ&q=chamanes+en+M%C3%A9xico&dq=chamanes+en+M%C3%A9xico&hl=es&sa=X&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBGoVChMI_pTF3KvhxgIVAxSSCh3zuQx}}</ref>\n\nIn certain regions, the profession of a creed other than the Catholic is seen as a threat to community unity. It is argued that the Catholic religion is part of the ethnic identity, and that the Protestants are not willing to participate in the traditional customs and practices (the [[tequio]] or community work, participation in the festivities and similar issues). The refusal of the Protestants is because their religious beliefs do not allow them to participate in the cult of images. In extreme cases, tension between Catholics and Protestants has led to the expulsion or even murder of Protestants in several villages. The best known cases are those of [[San Juan Chamula]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/11/11/042n3est.php|title=En Chamula, cambiar religi\u00f3n se considera delito|date=June 16, 2009|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616041417/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2005/11/11/042n3est.php|archivedate=June 16, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2000/06/03/pol4.html|title=pol4|website=www.jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> in Chiapas, and San Nicol\u00e1s, in [[Ixmiquilpan]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2001/07/22/mas-hilo.html|title=mas-hilo|website=www.jornada.unam.mx}}</ref> [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]].\n\n[[File:D\u00eda de muertos 1.JPG|upright=0.9|thumb|left|Offering of [[Day of the Dead]] (''D\u00eda de Muertos'').]]\n[[File:The Kid - Diego Rivera.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Detail of the 1947 mural of [[Diego Rivera]] that created [[La Calavera Catrina|La Catrina]]. The image of La  Catrina is commonly seen reflected as part of the Day of the Dead (''D\u00eda de Muertos'') celebrations throughout the country.]]\nA similar argument was presented by a committee of anthropologists to request the government of the Republic to expel the [[SIL International|Summer Linguistic Institute]] (SIL), in the year 1979, which was accused of promoting the division of indigenous peoples by translating the [[Bible]] into vernacular languages and evangelizing in a Protestant creed that threatened the integrity of popular cultures. The Mexican government paid attention to the call of the anthropologists and canceled the agreement that had held with the SIL. Conflicts have also occurred in other areas of social life. For example, given that Jehovah's Witnesses are prohibited from surrendering honors to national symbols (something that is done every Monday in Mexican public schools), children who have been educated in that religion were expelled from public schools. This type of problem can only be solved with the intervention of the National Commission of [[Human Rights]], and not always with favorable results for children.\n\nThe impact of the Catholic religion in Mexico has also caused a fusion of elements. Beyond churches and religious denominations, a phenomenon persists in Mexico that some anthropologists and sociologists call \"popular religion\", that is, religion as the practice and understanding of the people. In Mexico, the main component is the Catholic religion, to which elements of other beliefs have been added, already of pre-Hispanic, African or Asian origin. In general, popular religiosity is viewed with bad eyes by institutionally structured religions. One of the most exemplary cases of popular religiosity is the cult of [[Santa Muerte|Holy Dead]] (Santa Muerte). The Catholic hierarchy insists on describing it as a satanic cult. However, most of the people who profess this cult declare themselves to be Catholic believers, and consider that there is no contradiction between the tributes they offer to the ''White Child'' and the adoration of God. Other examples are the representations of the [[Stations of the Cross|Passion of Christ]] and the celebration of [[Day of the Dead]], which take place within the framework of the Catholic Christian imaginary, but under a very particular reinterpretation of its protagonists.\n\nThe presence of [[History of the Jews in Mexico|Jews in Mexico]] dates back to 1521, when Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s conquered the Aztecs, accompanied by several [[Converso]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Primack|first=Karen|title=Jews in places you never thought of|year=1998|publisher=KTAV Publishing House, Inc.|page=305|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GhD0JZAOTHUC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=jews+came+to+mexico+in+1521#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=978-0-88125-608-6}}</ref>  According to the 2010 census, there are 67,476 Jews in Mexico.<ref name=\"2010-census\"/> [[Islam in Mexico]] is practiced mostly by [[Arab Mexican]]s.

Exogenous cultural elements have been incorporated into Mexican culture as time has passed.\n\nThe Porfirian era (''el [[Porfirio D\u00edaz|Porfiriato]]''), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President D\u00edaz himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the [[Mexican Revolution]], cultural identity has had its foundation in the ''mestizaje'', of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]] in his publication ''La Raza C\u00f3smica'' (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the ''mestizo'') not only biologically but culturally as well.<ref name=\"vasconcelos160\">{{Cite book|last=Vasconcelos|first=Jos\u00e9|others=Didier T.

The cave painting in Mexican territory is about 7500 years old, and has been manifested in the caves of the [[Baja California Peninsula]]. Pre-Hispanic Mexico is present in buildings and caves, in [[Aztec codices]], in [[ceramics]], in garments, etc. .; examples of this are the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] mural paintings of [[Bonampak]], or those of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], those of [[Cacaxtla]] and those of [[Monte Alb\u00e1n]].\n\nThe mural painting had an important flowering during the 16th century, the same in religious constructions as in houses of lineage; such is the case of the convents of [[Acolman]], [[Actopan, Hidalgo|Actopan]], [[Huejotzingo]], [[Tecamachalco, Puebla|Tecamachalco]] and [[Zinacantepec]]. It is said that they were mainly indigenous painters led by friars who made them. These were also manifested in illustrated manuscripts such as the [[Matr\u00edcula de Tributos]].\n\nFor a time it was believed that the first European painter living in [[New Spain]] was [[Rodrigo de Cifuentes]], an apocryphal artist who even came to be attributed works such as ''The Baptism of the [[Cacique]]s de Tlaxcala'', painting of the main altarpiece of the [[Convento de San Francisco, Tlaxcala|Convent of San Francisco]] in [[Tlaxcala]]. Among the native painters was [[Marcos Aquino]]. The religiosity of the Novohispanos (\"New-Spanish\") made that the painting was important for the evangelization of the society, the friars realized the graphic skills of the natives, who enriched the baroque and [[mannerist]] style. The arrival of several European painters and some students from New Spain, such as [[Juan Correa]], [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villalpando]] or [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], who made the walls and altarpieces the main source of ideological and political expression of artists.\n\nThe painting of the 19th century had a very marked romantic influence, landscapes and portraits were the greatest expression of this era. [[Hermenegildo Bustos]] is one of the most appreciated painters of the [[historiography]] of Mexican art. They also emphasize in these years [[Santiago Rebull]], [[Jos\u00e9 Salom\u00e9 Pina]], [[F\u00e9lix Parra]], [[Eugenio Landesio]] and his famous disciple, the landscaper [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco G\u00f3mez]], as well like [[Julio Ruelas]].\n\nThe [[Mexican art|Mexican painting]] of the 20th century has achieved world renown with figures such as [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Clausell]], [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[Diego Rivera]], generation of idealists who marked the image of modern Mexico in the face of strong social and economic criticism. The Oaxacan School quickly gained fame and prestige, diffusion of an ancestral and modern culture, freedom of design is observed in relation to the color and texture of the canvases and murals as a period of transition between the 20th century and the 21st century.\n\nSome of the most outstanding painters in the 21st century (current painters): [[Patricia Calvo Guzm\u00e1n]]. She studied painting in Beijing. Her work, of marked oriental influence, recalls the cut paper figures of Mexico and China, mixing them with a rich chromatic range; [[Eliseo Garza Aguilar]], painter and [[performer]] considered among the leading exponents of the provocative and reflective art of the Third Millennium; in search of a critical response from the spectators, he combines his pictorial work in the [[performance]]s with theatrical histrionics; [[Pilar Goutas]], a painter who uses oil on amate support, with strong influence from [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Chinese calligraphy]]; [[Rafael Torres Correa]] settles his residence in Mexico in 2001 and joins the contemporary art workshop \"La Polilla\" in [[Guadalajara]], and performs various plastic and scenographic projects.\n\nThroughout history several prominent painters of different nationalities have expressed in their works the face of Mexico. Among the most outstanding we can mention [[Daniel Thomas Egerton]], [[Carl Nebel]], [[Thomas Moran]], [[\u00c9douard Manet]] and [[Leonora Carrington]].\n\n=== Sculpture ===\n{{Main|Sculpture in Mexico}}\nSculpture in Mexico is strongly manifested in Mesoamerican pre-Columbian cultures ([[Maya civilization|Mayans]], [[Olmec]]s, [[Toltec]]s, [[Mixtec]]s, [[Aztec]]s), etc., being this generally religious.\n\nFrom the Spanish conquest, civil and religious sculpture is worked by indigenous artists, with guidance from teachers of the peninsula, so some pre-Hispanic features are shown. Since the 17th century, white and [[mestizo]] sculptors have created works with a marked influence of European classicism.\n\nRomanticism tended to break the strict norms and models of classicism, as it pursued ideas influenced by realism and nationalism. The religious sculpture was reduced to a sporadic imagery, while the secular sculpture continued in portraits and monumental art of a civic nature. Between 1820 and 1880 the predominant themes were, successively: religious images, biblical scenes, allegories to the symbols of the insurgency movement and scenes and characters of pre-Cortesian history, and portraits of the old aristocracy, of the nascent bourgeoisie and commanders of the pre-revolution. The transcendent was to introduce civil reasons, the first national types and glimpses of a current of self-expression.\n\nDuring the 20th century, great exponents of Mexican sculpture are [[Juan Soriano]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Cuevas]], [[Sebasti\u00e1n (sculptor)|Enrique Carbajal]] (''Sebasti\u00e1n''), English [[Leonora Carrington]].\n\n=== Architecture ===\n{{Main|Architecture of Mexico}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = right\n | width = \n | footer = \n | image1 = SSA41434.JPG\n | caption1 =[[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], [[State of Mexico]]\n | image2 = Palacio de cortez 9.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Palace of Cort\u00e9s, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cort\u00e9s]], [[Cuernavaca]], is the oldest conserved colonial-era civil structure in the continental Americas.\n | image3 = Catedral zacatecas.jpg\n | caption3 = [[Zacatecas Cathedral]]\n\n }}\n\nThe presence of the human being in the Mexican territory has left important archaeological findings of great importance for the explanation of the habitat of primitive man and contemporary man. The Mesoamerican civilizations managed to have great stylistic development and proportion on the human and urban scale, the form was evolving from simplicity to aesthetic complexity; in the north of the country the adobe and stone architecture is manifested, the multifamily housing as we can see in [[Casas Grandes]]; and the troglodyte dwelling in caves of the Sierra Madre Occidental.\n\nUrbanism had a great development in pre-Hispanic cultures, where we can see the magnitude of the cities of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tollan-Xicocotitlan]] and [[Tenochtitlan|M\u00e9xico-Tenochtitlan]], within the environmentalist urbanism highlight the Mayan cities to be incorporated into the monumentality of its buildings with the thickness of the jungle and complex networks of roads called ''sakb\u00e9s''.\n\nWith the arrival of the Spaniards, architectural theories of the Greco-Roman order with Arab influences were introduced. Due to the process of [[Evangelization in New Spain|evangelization]], when the first monastic temples and monasteries were built, their own models were projected, such as the [[mendicant monasteries in Mexico|mendicant monasteries]], unique in their type in architecture. The interaction between Spaniards and natives gave rise to artistic styles such as the so-called ''[[tequitqui]]'' (from [[Nahuatl]]: worker). Years later the baroque and mannerism were imposed in large cathedrals and civil buildings, while rural areas are built [[hacienda]]s or stately farms with Mozarabic tendencies.\n\nIn the 19th century the neoclassical movement arose as a response to the objectives of the republican nation, one of its examples are the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]] where the strict plastic of the classical orders are represented in their architectural elements, new religious buildings also arise, civilian and military that demonstrate the presence of neoclassicism. Romanticists from a past seen through archeology show images of medieval Europe, Islamic and pre-Hispanic Mexico in the form of architectural elements in the construction of international exhibition pavilions looking for an identity typical of the national culture. The ''art nouveau'', and the ''art deco'' were styles introduced into the design of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] to mark the identity of the Mexican nation with Greek-Roman and pre-Hispanic symbols.\n\nModern architecture in Mexico has an important development in the plasticity of form and space, [[Jos\u00e9 Villagr\u00e1n Garc\u00eda]] develops a theory of form that sets the pattern of teaching in many schools of architecture in the country within functionalism. The emergence of the new [[Mexican architecture]] was born as a formal order of the policies of a nationalist state that sought modernity and the differentiation of other nations. [[Juan O'Gorman]] was one of the first environmental architects in Mexico, developing the \"organic\" theory, trying to integrate the building with the landscape within the same approaches of [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arqhys.com/arquitectura-mexicana.html|title=Arquitectura mexicana|website=www.arqhys.com}}</ref> In the search for a new architecture that does not resemble the styles of the past, it achieves a joint manifestation with the mural painting and the [[landscaping]].\n\nThe [[Jalisco School]] was a proposal of those socio-political movements that the country demanded. [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]] managed to combine the shape of the space with forms of rural vernacular architecture of Mexico and Mediterranean countries (Spain-Morocco), integrating an impressive color that handles light and shade in different tones and opens a look at the international [[minimalism]].\n\nMexican architecture is a cultural phenomenon born of the ideology of nationalist governments of the 20th century, which was shaping the identity image by its colorful and variegated ornamental elements inherited from ancestral cultures, classical and monumental forms and, subsequently, the incorporation of modernism and cutting-edge international trends.\n\n=== The Mexican (Lo mexicano) ===\n\nIn ethnic and cultural terms, ''Lo mexicano'' corresponds only to everything that is referred to the [[Aztec]] culture; therefore, ethnically Mexicans are those who are also known as ''[[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]]'' and whose language is [[Nahuatl]].<ref>[http://www.lacult.org/docc/oralidad_08_86-89-arte-de-la-lengua-mexicana.pdf El arte de la lengua mexicana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515211808/http://www.lacult.org/docc/oralidad_08_86-89-arte-de-la-lengua-mexicana.pdf |date=May 15, 2013 }}</ref> There is a strong discussion to define The Mexican (''Lo mexicano''); there are two completely divided aspects: ethnic and cultural, which focuses exclusively on the [[Mesoamerica]]n people called ''Mexica people'', and the legal-administrative aspect of the territory called ''Mexico''. In legal terms and in accordance with the [[Constitution of Mexico|Constitution]], a ''Mexican'' is a citizen born within the territory of the United Mexican States or whoever has decided adopt the [[Mexican citizenship]].\n\n''The Mexican'' could be what characterizes the being of Mexico and its people; however, it is an ethnic concept that only defines the mestizo identity that had been related for a long time and that is limited with respect to the ethnic diversity of the country. It is an intellectual construction product of the approaches of specialists to the [[cultural]] reality of the country. In trying to capture in a single figure the [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] reality of Mexico, the result of the intellectual analysis has produced a series of [[stereotype]]s and [[truism]]s about what it is to be a Mexican. This discourse about The Mexican has been used in the political field to legitimize power, and at the same time it is imposed on the population of the country as a fact beyond all doubt.\n\nThe intellectual construction of the [[mestizo]] is in dialogue with the triumph of revolutionary nationalism, which was born after the [[Mexican Revolution]]. In the reflection on the subject (the character of the Mexican, the mexicanity, the definition of a Mexican) have participated, among others: [[Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos Calder\u00f3n|Jos\u00e9 Vasconcelos]],<ref>Vasconcelos Calder\u00f3n, 1925.</ref> [[Samuel Ramos]],<ref>Ramos, 1934.</ref> [[Emilio Uranga]],<ref>Uranga, 1952.</ref> [[Jos\u00e9 Gaos]], [[Leopoldo Zea Aguilar|Leopoldo Zea]], [[Jorge Portilla]], [[Santiago Ram\u00edrez Sandoval|Santiago Ram\u00edrez]], [[Salvador P\u00e9rez Nevares]], [[Roger Bartra]], [[Jos\u00e9 del Val]], [[Arturo Warman]], [[Aniceto Aramoni]], [[Rogelio D\u00edaz Guerrero]], [[Ezequiel Adeodato Ch\u00e1vez Lavista]], [[Mauro Rodr\u00edguez Estrada]] and [[Carlos Chilpa Navarrete]].<ref>Sergio L\u00f3pez Ramos, coord. .

The most well known prehispanic poet is [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]]. Modern Mexican literature was influenced by the concepts of the Spanish colonialization of [[Mesoamerica]]. Outstanding colonial writers and poets include [[Juan Ruiz de Alarc\u00f3n]] and [[Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]].\n\nOther writers include [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Fern\u00e1ndez de Lizardi]], [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Octavio Paz]] (Nobel Laureate), [[Renato Leduc]], [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]], [[Elena Poniatowska]], [[Mariano Azuela]] (\"Los de abajo\") and [[Juan Rulfo]] (\"Pedro P\u00e1ramo\").

Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of Mexican muralism, painted the [[Man at the Crossroads]] at the [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed the next year because of the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockefeller Controversy|publisher=Diego Rivera Prints|url=http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|accessdate=October 2, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011103154/http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|archivedate=October 11, 2007}}</ref> Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palace of Fine Arts]].\n\n[[Mesoamerican architecture]] is mostly noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt. [[Spanish Colonial architecture]] is marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain.

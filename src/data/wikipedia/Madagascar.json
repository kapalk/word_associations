The nation comprises the island of [[Geography of Madagascar|Madagascar]] (the fourth-[[List of islands by area|largest island]] in the world) and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the [[supercontinent]] [[Gondwana]], Madagascar split from the [[Indian peninsula|Indian subcontinent]] around 88&nbsp;million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a [[biodiversity hotspot]]; over 90% of [[wildlife of Madagascar|its wildlife]] is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats.\n\nThe first archaeological evidence for human foraging on Madagascar may have occurred as much as 10,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite news|title=For Thousands of Years, Humans Coexisted with the Largest Birds That Ever Lived|url=https://www.livescience.com/63568-humans-killed-elephant-birds-madagascar.html|date=13 September 2018}}</ref> Human settlement of Madagascar occurred between 350&nbsp;BC and 550 AD by [[Austronesian peoples]], arriving on [[outrigger canoe]]s from [[Borneo]]. These were joined around the 9th century AD by [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] migrants crossing the [[Mozambique Channel]] from East Africa. Other groups continued to settle on Madagascar over time, each one making lasting contributions to Malagasy cultural life. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy ethnic group]] is often divided into 18 or more [[Ethnic groups of Madagascar|subgroups]], of which the largest are the [[Merina people|Merina]] of the central highlands.\n\nUntil the late 18th century, the island of Madagascar was ruled by a fragmented assortment of shifting sociopolitical alliances. Beginning in the early 19th century, most of the island was united and ruled as the [[Merina Kingdom|Kingdom of Madagascar]] by a [[List of Malagasy monarchs|series]] of Merina [[andriana|nobles]]. The monarchy ended in 1897 when the island was absorbed into the [[French colonial empire]], from which the island gained independence in 1960. The autonomous state of Madagascar has since undergone four major constitutional periods, termed republics. Since 1992, the nation has officially been governed as a constitutional democracy from its capital at [[Antananarivo]]. However, in a [[2009 Malagasy political crisis|popular uprising in 2009]], president [[Marc Ravalomanana]] was made to resign and presidential power was transferred in March 2009 to [[Andry Rajoelina]]. Constitutional governance was restored in January 2014, when [[Hery Rajaonarimampianina]] was named president following a [[Malagasy general election, 2013|2013 election]] deemed fair and transparent by the international community. Madagascar is a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[African Union]] (AU), the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), and the [[Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie]].\n\nMadagascar belongs to the group of least developed countries, according to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unohrlls.org/about-ldcs/|title=About LDCs |publisher=UN-OHRLLS|access-date=22 February 2017}}</ref> [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] and [[French language|French]] are both [[official language]]s of the state. The majority of the population adheres to [[Malagasy mythology|traditional beliefs]], [[Christianity in Madagascar|Christianity]], or an amalgamation of both. Ecotourism and agriculture, paired with greater investments in education, health, and private enterprise, are key elements of Madagascar's development strategy. Under Ravalomanana, these investments produced substantial economic growth, but the benefits were not evenly spread throughout the population, producing tensions over the increasing cost of living and declining living standards among the poor and some segments of the middle class. {{As of|2017}}, the economy has been weakened by the 2009\u20132013 political crisis, and quality of life remains low for the majority of the Malagasy population.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn the [[Malagasy language]], the island of Madagascar is called ''Madagasikara'' ({{IPA-mg|mada\u0261as\u02b2\u02c8k\u02b2ar\u0259\u0325}}) and its people are referred to as ''[[Malagasy people|Malagasy]]''.<ref name=NatGeo1>{{cite web |last = National Geographic |title = Style Manual |url=http://stylemanual.ngs.org/home/M/madagascan-malagasy |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6053JX6vh  |archivedate = 31 August 2012 |accessdate =31 August 2012}}</ref> The island's appellation \"Madagascar\" is not of local origin but rather was popularized in the [[Middle Ages]] by Europeans.<ref name=Cousins>Cousins (1895), pp. 11\u201312</ref> The name ''Madageiscar'' was first recorded in the memoirs of 13th-century Venetian explorer [[Marco Polo]] as a corrupted transliteration of the name [[Mogadishu]], the [[Somalia|Somali]] port with which Polo had confused the island.<ref name=\"Room 2006, p. 230\">Room (2006), p. 230</ref>\n\nOn [[Lawrence of Rome|St. Laurence]]'s Day in 1500, Portuguese explorer [[Diogo Dias]] landed on the island and named it ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o''. Polo's name was preferred and popularized on [[Renaissance]] maps.

Many high-level technical positions were filled by French expatriates, and French teachers, textbooks and curricula continued to be used in schools around the country.

General [[Gilles Andriamahazo]] ruled after Ratsimandrava for four months before being replaced by another military appointee: Vice Admiral [[Didier Ratsiraka]], who ushered in the socialist-Marxist [[Democratic Republic of Madagascar|Second Republic]] that ran under his tenure from 1975 to 1993.\n\nThis period saw a political alignment with the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries and a shift toward economic insularity. These policies, coupled with economic pressures stemming from the [[1973 oil crisis]], resulted in the rapid collapse of Madagascar's economy and a sharp decline in living standards,<ref name=\"LOC\"/> and the country had become completely bankrupt by 1979.

Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was a key factor in launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import\u2013export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75&nbsp;percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the rural population was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50&nbsp;percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.<ref name=EBLand/>\n\nThe IMF forced Madagascar's government to accept structural adjustment policies and liberalization of the economy when the state became bankrupt in 1982 and state-controlled industries were gradually privatized over the course of the 1980s.

Conditions for the resumption of aid were not met under Zafy, who tried unsuccessfully to attract other forms of revenue for the State before aid was once again resumed under the interim government established upon Zafy's impeachment. The IMF agreed to write off half Madagascar's debt in 2004 under the Ravalomanana administration.

Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.<ref name=\"LOC\"/><ref name=Bradtbeliefs/>\n\nAlthough social castes are no longer legally recognized, ancestral caste affiliation often continues to affect social status, economic opportunity, and roles within the community.<ref>Middleton (1999), pp.&nbsp;259\u2013262, 272, 309</ref> Malagasy people traditionally consult ''Mpanandro'' (\"Makers of the Days\") to identify the most auspicious days for important events such as weddings or ''famadihana'', according to a traditional astrological system introduced by Arabs. Similarly, the nobles of many Malagasy communities in the pre-colonial period would commonly employ advisers known as the ''ombiasy'' (from ''olona-be-hasina'', \"man of much virtue\") of the southeastern [[Antemoro people|Antemoro]] ethnic group, who trace their ancestry back to early Arab settlers.<ref>Ames (2003), p. 101</ref>\n\nThe diverse origins of Malagasy culture are evident in its tangible expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the ''[[valiha]]'', is a [[bamboo]] tube [[zither]] carried to Madagascar by early settlers from [[South Kalimantan|southern Borneo]], and is very similar in form to those found in [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesia]] and the [[Music of the Philippines|Philippines]] today.<ref name=\"Blench, R. 1982 pp. 81-93\">{{cite journal |last = Blench |first = Roger |title = Evidence for the Indonesian origins of certain elements of African culture |journal = African Music |volume = 6 |issue = 2 |pages = 81\u201393 |year = 1982 |subscription=yes |jstor = 30249759}}</ref> Traditional [[Architecture of Madagascar|houses in Madagascar]] are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar.<ref>{{cite journal |last1 = Kus |first1 = Susan |last2 = Raharijaona |first2 = Victor |title = House to Palace, Village to State: Scaling up Architecture and Ideology |journal = American Anthropologist |series=New Series |issue = 102 |volume = 1 |pages = 98\u2013113 |year = 2000 |doi = 10.1525/aa.2000.102.1.98}}</ref> Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant in many regions and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living.<ref name=\"Acquier, Jean-Louis.\">Acquier (1997), pp.&nbsp;143\u2013175</ref> The production and weaving of silk can be traced back to the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven ''[[lamba (garment)|lamba]]'', has evolved into a varied and refined art.<ref>Kusimba, Odland & Bronson (2004), p. 12</ref>\n\nThe Southeast Asian cultural influence is also evident in [[Malagasy cuisine]], in which rice is consumed at every meal, typically accompanied by one of a variety of flavorful vegetable or meat dishes.<ref name=\"Antal\"/> African influence is reflected in the sacred importance of zebu cattle and their embodiment of their owner's wealth, traditions originating on the African mainland.

Among the most emblematic is ''[[fanorona]]'', a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions.

The complexity of Malagasy meals can range from the simple, traditional preparations introduced by the earliest settlers, to the refined festival dishes prepared for the island's 19th-century monarchs.

The many varieties of ''laoka'' may be [[vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian]] or include animal proteins, and typically feature a sauce flavored with such ingredients as ginger, onion, garlic, tomato, vanilla, coconut milk, salt, curry powder, green peppercorns or, less commonly, other spices or herbs. In parts of the arid south and west, pastoral families may replace rice with maize, [[cassava]], or [[curd]]s made from fermented zebu milk. A wide variety of sweet and savory [[fritter]]s as well as other street foods are available across the island, as are diverse tropical and temperate-climate fruits.

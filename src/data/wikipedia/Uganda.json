It is bordered to the east by [[Kenya]], to the north by [[South Sudan]], to the west by the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], to the south-west by [[Rwanda]], and to the south by [[Tanzania]]. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of [[Lake Victoria]], shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Uganda also lies within the [[Nile|Nile basin]], and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate.\n\nUganda takes its name from the [[Buganda]] kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country, including the capital [[Kampala]]. The people of Uganda were [[hunter-gatherer]]s until 1,700 to 2,300 years ago, when [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking populations migrated to the southern parts of the country.\n\nBeginning in 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the UK, who established administrative law across the territory. Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962. The period since then has been marked by intermittent conflicts, including a [[Lord's Resistance Army insurgency|lengthy civil war]] against the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] in the Northern Region led by [[Joseph Kony]], which has caused hundreds of thousands of casualties.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2012/03/08/who_is_joseph_kony_a_look_at_the_ugandan_warlord.html | title=Who is Joseph Kony?

Colonial governors had failed to come up with a formula that worked. This was further complicated by Buganda's nonchalant attitude to its relationship with the central government. Buganda never sought independence, but rather appeared to be comfortable with a loose arrangement that guaranteed them privileges above the other subjects within the protectorate or a special status when the British left. This was evidenced in part by hostilities between the British colonial authorities and Buganda prior to independence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Crawford|title=The politics of cultural pluralism|date=1979|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=9780299067441|pages=248\u2013250}}</ref>\n\nWithin Buganda there were divisions \u2013 between those who wanted the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] to remain a dominant monarch, and those who wanted to join with the rest of Uganda to create a modern secular state. The split resulted in the creation of two dominant Buganda based parties \u2013 the Kabaka Yekka (Kabaka Only) KY, and the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] (DP) that had roots in the Catholic Church. The bitterness between these two parties was extremely intense especially as the first elections for the post-Colonial parliament approached. The Kabaka particularly disliked the DP leader, [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mutibwa|first1=Phares|title=Uganda since independence, a story of unfulfilled hopes|date=1992|publisher=Hurst|location=London|isbn=9781850650669}}</ref>\n\nOutside Buganda, a quiet spoken politician from Northern Uganda, [[Milton Obote]], had forged an alliance of non-Buganda politicians to form the Uganda People's Congress (UPC). The UPC at its heart was dominated by politicians who wanted to rectify what they saw as the regional inequality that favoured Buganda's special status. This drew in substantial support from outside Buganda. The party however remained a loose alliance of interests but Obote showed great skill at negotiating them into a common ground based on a federal formula.<ref name=\"Kasozi\">{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=A.

Uganda was one of the few colonial territories that achieved independence without a dominant political party with a clear majority in parliament. In the pre-Independence elections, the UPC ran no candidates in Buganda and won 37 of the 61 directly elected seats (outside Buganda). The DP won 24 seats outside Buganda. The \"special status\" granted to Buganda meant that the 21 Buganda seats were elected by proportional representation reflecting the elections to the Buganda parliament \u2013 the Lukikko. KY won a resounding victory over DP, winning all 21 seats.\n\nThe UPC reached a high at the end of 1964 when the leader of the DP in parliament, [[Basil Kiiza Bataringaya]] crossed the parliamentary floor with five other MPs, leaving DP with only nine seats. The DP MPs were not particularly happy that their leader Benedicto Kiwanuka's hostility towards the Kabaka that was hindering their chances of compromise with KY.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bade|first1=Albert|title=Benedicto Kiwanuka : the man and his politics|date=1996|publisher=Fountain Publ.|location=Kampala|isbn=978-9970020089}}</ref> The trickle of defections turned into a flood when 10 KY members crossed the floor when they realised the formal coalition with the UPC was no longer viable. Obote's charismatic speeches across the country were sweeping all before him, and the UPC was winning almost every local election held and increasing its control over all district councils and legislatures outside Buganda.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ciment|first1=James|title=Encyclopedia of conflicts since World War II|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780765680051|page=311|edition=2nd}}</ref> The response from the Kabaka was mute \u2013 probably content in his ceremonial role and symbolism in his part of the country. However, there were also major divisions within his palace that made it difficult for him to act effectively against Obote. By the time Uganda had become independent, Buganda \"was a divided house with contending social and political forces\"<ref name=Kasozi63>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=63|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\nThere were however problems brewing inside the UPC. As its ranks swelled, the ethnic, religious, regional and personal interests began to shake the party. The party's apparent strength was eroded in a complex sequence of factional conflicts in its central and regional structures. And by 1966, the UPC was tearing itself apart. The conflicts were further intensified by the newcomers who had crossed the parliamentary floor from DP and KY.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=71|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe UPC delegates arrived in [[Gulu]] in 1964 for their delegates conference. Here was the first demonstration as to how Obote was losing control of his party. The battle over the Secretary General of the party was a bitter contest between the new moderate's candidate \u2013 [[Grace Ibingira]] and the radical John Kakonge. Ibingira subsequently became the symbol of the opposition to Obote within the UPC. This is an important factor when looking at the subsequent events that led to the crisis between Buganda and the Central government. For those outside the UPC (including KY supporters), this was a sign that Obote was vulnerable. Keen observers realised the UPC was not a cohesive unit.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=70|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nThe collapse of the UPC-KY alliance openly revealed the dissatisfaction Obote and others had about Buganda's \"special status\". In 1964 The government responded to demands from some parts of the vast Buganda Kingdom that they were not the Kabaka's subjects. Prior to colonial rule Buganda had been rivalled by the neighbouring [[Bunyoro]] kingdom. Buganda had conquered parts of Bunyoro and the British colonialists had formalised this in the Buganda Agreements. Known as the \"lost counties\", the people in these areas wished to revert to being part of Bunyoro. Obote decided to allow a referendum, which angered the Kabaka and most of the rest of Buganda. The residents of the counties voted to return to Bunyoro despite the Kabaka's attempts to influence the vote.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lamwaka|first1=Caroline|title=The Raging Storm: A Reporter's Inside Account of the Northern Uganda War, 1986\u20132005|date=2016|publisher=Fountain Publishers|location=Kampala|isbn=978-9970252213}}</ref> Having lost the referendum, KY opposed the bill to pass the counties to Bunyoro, thus ending the alliance with the UPC.\n\nThe tribal nature of Ugandan politics was also manifesting itself in government. The UPC which had previously been a national party began to break along tribal lines when Ibingira challenged Obote in the UPC. The \"North/South\" ethnic divide that had been evident in economic and social spheres now entrenched itself in politics. Obote surrounded himself with mainly northern politicians \u2013 A. A. Neykon, Felix Onama, Alex Ojera \u2013 while Ibingira's supporters who were subsequently arrested and jailed with him, were mainly from the South \u2013 George Magezi, B. Kirya, Matthias Ngobi. In time, the two factions acquired ethnic labels \u2013 \"Bantu\" (the mainly Southern Ibingira faction) and \"Nilotic\" (the mainly Northern Obote faction). The perception that the government was at war with the Bantu was further enhanced when Obote arrested and imprisoned the mainly Bantu ministers who backed Ibingira.<ref name=\"Otunnu\">{{cite book|last1=Otunnu|first1=Ogenga|title=Crisis of Legitimacy and Political Violence in Uganda, 1890 to 1979|date=2016|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-3319331553}}</ref>\n\nThese labels brought into the mix two very powerful influences. First Buganda \u2013 the people of Buganda are Bantu and therefore naturally aligned to the Ibingira faction. The Ibingira faction further advanced this alliance by accusing Obote of wanting to overthrow the Kabaka.<ref name=\"Otunnu\" /> They were now aligned to opposing Obote. Second \u2013 the security forces \u2013 the British colonialists had recruited the army and police almost exclusively from Northern Uganda due to their perceived suitability for these roles. At independence, the army and police was dominated by northern tribes \u2013 mainly Nilotic. They would now feel more affiliated to Obote, and he took full advantage of this to consolidate his power. In April 1966, Obote passed out eight hundred new army recruits at [[Moroto Town|Moroto]], of whom seventy percent came from the Northern Region.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=83|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIt is true that at the time there was a tendency to see central government and security forces as dominated by \"northerners\" \u2013 particularly the Acholi who through the UPC had significant access to government positions at national level.<ref name=\"LRA-MR\">{{cite book|last1=Allen|first1=Tim|last2=Vlassenroot|first2=Koen|title=The Lord's Resistance Army: myth and reality|date=2010|publisher=Zed|location=London|isbn=9781848135635}}</ref> In northern Uganda there were also varied degrees of anti-Buganda feelings, particularly over the kingdom's \"special status\" before and after independence, and all the economic and social benefits that came with this status. \"Obote brought significant numbers of northerners into the central state, both through the civil service and military, and created a patronage machine in Northern Uganda\".<ref name=\"LRA-MR\" /> However, both \"Bantu\" and \"Nilotic\" labels represent significant ambiguities. The Bantu category for example includes both Buganda and Bunyoro \u2013 historically bitter rivals. The Nilotic label includes the Lugbara, Acholi and Langi who have bitter rivalries that were to define Uganda's military politics later. Despite these ambiguities, these events unwittingly brought to fore the northerner/southerner political divide which to some extent still influences Ugandan politics.\n\nThe UPC fragmentation continued as opponents sensed Obote's vulnerability. At local level where the UPC dominated most councils discontent began to challenge incumbent council leaders. Even in Obote's home district, attempts were made to oust the head of the local district council in 1966. A more worrying fact for the UPC was that the next national elections loomed in 1967 \u2013 and without the support of KY (who were now likely to back the DP), and the growing factionalism in the UPC, there was the real possibility that the UPC would be out of power in months.\n\nObote went after KY with a new act of parliament in early 1966 that blocked any attempt by KY to expand outside Buganda. KY appeared to respond in parliament through one of their few remaining MPs, the terminally ill Daudi Ochieng. Ochieng was an irony \u2013 although from Northern Uganda, he had risen high in the ranks of KY and become a close confidant to the Kabaka who had gifted him with large land titles in Buganda. In Obote's absence from Parliament, Ochieng laid bare the illegal plundering of ivory and gold from the Congo that had been orchestrated by Obote's army chief of staff, Colonel [[Idi Amin]]. He further alleged that Obote, Onama and Neykon had all benefited from the scheme.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Somerville|first1=Keith|title=Ivory: Power and Poaching in Africa|date=2017|publisher=Hurst|location=London|isbn=9781849046763}}</ref> Parliament overwhelmingly voted in favour of a motion to censure Amin and investigate Obote's involvement. This shook the government and raised tensions in the country.\n\nKY further demonstrated its ability to challenge Obote from within his party at the UPC Buganda conference where Godfrey Binaisa (the Attorney General) was ousted by a faction believed to have the backing of KY, Ibingira and other anti-Obote elements in Buganda.<ref name=Kasozi63 /> Obote's response was to arrest Ibingira and other ministers at a cabinet meeting and to assume special powers in February 1966. In March 1966, Obote also announced that the offices of President and Vice President would cease to exist \u2013 effectively dismissing the Kabaka. Obote also gave Amin more power \u2013 giving him the Army Commander position over the previous holder (Opolot) who had relations to Buganda through marriage (possibly believing Opolot would be reluctant to take military action against the Kabaka if it came to that). Obote abolished the constitution and effectively suspended elections due in a few months. Obote went on television and radio to accuse the Kabaka of various offences including requesting foreign troops which appears to have been explored by the Kabaka following the rumours of Amin plotting a coup.\nObote further dismantled the authority of the Kabaka by announcing among other measures:\n* The abolition of independent public service commissions for federal units. This removed the Kabaka's authority to appoint civil servants in Buganda.\n* The abolition of the Buganda High Court \u2013 removing any judicial authority the Kabaka had.\n* The bringing of Buganda financial management under further central control.\n* Abolition of lands for Buganda chiefs. Land is one the key sources of Kabaka's power over his subjects.\n\nThe lines were now drawn for a show down between Buganda and the Central government. Historians may argue about whether this could have been avoided through compromise. This was unlikely as Obote now felt emboldened and saw the Kabaka as weak. Indeed, by accepting the presidency four years earlier and siding with the UPC, the Kabaka had divided his people and taken the side of one against the other. Within Buganda's political institutions, rivalries driven by religion and personal ambition made the institutions ineffective and unable to respond to the central government moves. The Kabaka was often regarded as aloof and unresponsive to advice from the younger Buganda politicians who better understood the new post-Independence politics, unlike the traditionalists who were ambivalent to what was going on as long as their traditional benefits were maintained. The Kabaka favoured the neo-traditionalists.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=64|location=|isbn=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1966, the Kabaka made his move. He asked for foreign help and the Buganda parliament demanded that the Uganda government leave Buganda (including the capital, Kampala). In response Obote ordered Idi Amin to attack the Kabaka's palace. The battle for the Kabaka's palace was fierce \u2013 the Kabaka's guards putting up more resistance that had been expected. The British trained Captain \u2013 the Kabaka with about 120 armed men kept Idi Amin at bay for twelve hours.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kasozi|first1=|title=The social origins of violence in Uganda, 1964\u20131985|date=1994|publisher=|page=85|location=|isbn=}}</ref> It is estimated that up to 2,000 people died in the battle which ended when the army called in heavier guns and overran the palace. The anticipated countryside uprising in Buganda did not materialise and a few hours later a beaming Obote met the press to relish his victory. The Kabaka escaped over the palace walls and was scuttled off into exile in London by supporters. He died there three years later.\n\n===1966\u20131971 (before the coup)===\nIn 1966, following a power struggle between the Obote-led government and King Muteesa, Obote suspended the constitution and removed the ceremonial president and vice-president.

The first are filmmakers who use the [[Nollywood]] [[video film era]]'s guerrilla approach to film making, churning out a picture in around two weeks and screening it in makeshift video halls. The second is the filmmaker who has the film aesthetic, but with limited funds has to depend on the competitive scramble for donor cash.<ref name=\"cannesvupar.com\"/>\n\nThough cinema in Uganda is evolving it still faces major challenges. Along with technical problems such as refining acting and editing skills, there are issues regarding funding and lack of government support and investment. There are no schools in the country dedicated to film, banks do not extend credit to film ventures, and distribution and marketing of movies remains poor.<ref name=\"cannesvupar.com\"/><ref name=\"monitor.co.ug\"/>\n\nThe Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) is preparing regulations starting in 2014 that require Ugandan television to broadcast 70 percent Ugandan content and of this, 40 percent to be independent productions. With the emphasis on Ugandan Film and the UCC regulations favouring Ugandan productions for mainstream television, Ugandan film may become more prominent and successful in the near future.<ref name=\"monitor.co.ug\"/>\n\n===Media===\n{{main|Media of Uganda}}\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Uganda|Africa}}\n*[[Index of Uganda-related articles]]\n*[[Outline of Uganda]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Encyclopedia\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Appiah, Anthony and Henry Louis Gates (ed).

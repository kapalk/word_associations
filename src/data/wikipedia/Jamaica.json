Spanning {{convert|10,990|sqkm|sqmi}} in area, it is the third-largest island of the [[Greater Antilles]] and the fourth-largest island country in the [[Caribbean]]. Jamaica lies about {{convert|145|km|mi}} south of [[Cuba]], and {{convert|191|km|mi}} west of [[Hispaniola]] (the island containing the countries of [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]).\n\nPreviously inhabited by the indigenous [[Arawak]] and [[Ta\u00edno]] peoples, the island came under [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] following the arrival of [[Christopher Columbus]] in 1494. Many of the indigenous people died of disease, and the Spanish transplanted African slaves to Jamaica as labourers. The island remained a possession of Spain until 1655, when England (later [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]) conquered it and renamed it Jamaica. Under British colonial rule Jamaica became a leading sugar exporter, with its plantation economy highly dependent on African slaves. The British fully emancipated all slaves in 1838, and many freedmen chose to have [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farms]] rather than to work on plantations. Beginning in the 1840s, the British utilized Chinese and Indian [[indentured]] labour to work on plantations. The island achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 6 August 1962.\n\nWith {{#expr:{{replace|{{UN_Population|Jamaica}}|,|}}/1e6 round 1}} million people,{{UN_Population|ref}} Jamaica is the third-most populous [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] country in the [[Americas]] (after the United States and Canada), and the fourth-most populous country in the Caribbean. [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] is the country's capital and largest city, with a population of 937,700. [[Jamaicans]] mainly have African ancestry, with significant [[European Jamaicans|European]], [[Chinese Jamaicans|Chinese]], [[Indo-Jamaican|Indian]], [[Lebanese Jamaicans|Lebanese]], and mixed-race minorities. Due to a high rate of emigration for work since the 1960s, Jamaica has a [[Jamaican diaspora|large diaspora]], particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nJamaica is an upper-middle income country<ref name=\"Jamaica country\">{{cite web |url=https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/jamaica/overview | title=Jamaica (country) |publisher=World Bank}}</ref>  with an average of 4.3 million tourists a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://jis.gov.jm/record-4-3-million-tourist-arrivals-2017/ |title=Record 4.3 Million Tourist Arrivals in 2017 |publisher=Jamaica Information Service (Government of Jamaica) }}</ref>\n\nJamaica is a [[Commonwealth realm]], with [[Elizabeth II]] as [[Monarchy of Jamaica|its queen]].

They were brought in as indentured labourers and soldiers after the conquest of Jamaica by Cromwell's forces in 1655. The majority of Irish were transported by force as political prisoners of war from Ireland as a result of the ongoing [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]] at the time.<ref>https://tudorstuartireland.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/tsi-2015-abstracts.pdf</ref> Migration of large numbers of Irish to the island continued into the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irlandeses.org/0711rodgers2.htm |title=Rodgers, Nini, 'The Irish in the Caribbean 1641\u20131837: An Overview' |publisher=Irlandeses.org |date= |accessdate=2017-09-25}}</ref>\n\nJews were expelled from Spain in 1492 and then forcibly converted to Christianity in Portugal, during a period of persecution by the Inquisition. Some Spanish and Portuguese Jewish refugees went to the Netherlands and England, and from there to Jamaica. Others were part of the Iberian colonisation of the New World, after overtly converting to Catholicism, as only Catholics were allowed in the Spanish colonies. By 1660, Jamaica had become a refuge for Jews in the New World, also attracting those who had been expelled from Spain and Portugal.\n\nAn early group of Jews arrived in 1510, soon after the son of Christopher Columbus settled on the island. Primarily working as merchants and traders, the Jewish community was forced to live a clandestine life, calling themselves \"Portugals\". After the British took over rule of Jamaica, the Jews decided the best defense against Spain's regaining control was to encourage making the colony a base for Caribbean pirates. With the pirates installed in [[Port Royal]], which became the largest city in the Caribbean, the Spanish would be deterred from attacking. The British leaders agreed with the viability of this strategy to forestall outside aggression.<ref>\nKritzler, Edward, ''The Jewish Pirates of the Caribbean,'' Anchor, 2009, p. 15, {{ISBN|0767919521}}</ref>\n\nWhen the English captured Jamaica in 1655, the Spanish colonists fled after freeing their slaves.<ref name=\"jamsenghist\"/> The slaves dispersed into the mountains, joining the ''[[maroon (people)|maroons]],'' those who had previously escaped to live with the [[Ta\u00edno]] native people.<ref name=\"maroons\">{{cite web|last=Benitez|first=Suzette|title=The Maroons|url=http://scholar.library.miami.edu/slaves/Maroons/individual_essays/suzette1.html|accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref> During the centuries of slavery, Maroons established free communities in the mountainous interior of Jamaica, where they maintained their freedom and independence for generations. The [[Jamaican Maroons]] fought the British during the 18th century.

R. Ellis, Esq. M.P., c. 1820]]\nBy the beginning of the 19th century, Jamaica's dependence on slave labour and a plantation economy had resulted in black people outnumbering white people by a ratio of almost 20 to 1. Although the UK had outlawed the importation of slaves, some were still smuggled in from Spanish colonies and directly. While planning the abolition of slavery, the British Parliament passed laws to improve conditions for slaves. They banned the use of whips in the field and flogging of women; informed planters that slaves were to be allowed religious instruction, and required a free day during each week when slaves could sell their produce,<ref>''History of the Catholic Church in Jamaica'' {{ISBN|978-0-829-40544-6}} p. 68</ref> prohibiting Sunday markets to enable slaves to attend church.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThe House of Assembly in Jamaica resented and resisted the new laws. Members (then restricted to European-Jamaicans) claimed that the slaves were content and objected to Parliament's interference in island affairs. Slave owners feared possible revolts if conditions were lightened. Following a series of rebellions on the island and changing attitudes in Great Britain, the British government formally abolished slavery by an 1833 act, beginning in 1834, with full [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|emancipation]] from chattel slavery declared in 1838. The population in 1834 was 371,070, of whom 15,000 were white, 5,000 free black; 40,000 'coloured' or [[free people of color]] ([[mixed race]]); and 311,070 were slaves.<ref name=\"population\"/>\n\nOver the next 20 years, several epidemics of cholera, scarlatina, and smallpox hit the island killing almost 60,000 people (about 100 per day). Nevertheless, in 1871 the census was recorded at a population of 506,154 people, 246,573 of which were males, and 259,581 females. Their races were recorded as 13,101 White, 100,346 Coloured (mixed Black and White), and 392,707 Blacks.<ref>{{cite book |date=1908 |title=Handbook of Jamaica |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eT8LAAAAIAAJ |location=Google Books |publisher=Jamaica Government |page=37 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, the British established a number of [[botanical gardens]]. These included the [[Castleton Botanical Gardens]], developed in 1862 to replace the [[Bath, Jamaica|Bath Botanical Gardens]] (created in 1779) which was subject to flooding. [[Bath, Jamaica|Bath Botanical Gardens]] was the site for planting [[breadfruit]], brought to Jamaica from the Pacific by Captain [[William Bligh]]. It became a staple in island diets. Other gardens were the [[Cinchona]] [[Plantation]], founded in 1868, and the [[Hope Botanical Gardens]] founded in 1874. In 1872, [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]] was designated as the island's capital.\n\nIn 1945, [[Horace Hearne|Sir Horace Hector Hearne]] became [[Chief Justice]] and Keeper of the Records in Jamaica. He headed the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]], Kingston between 1945 and 1950/1951. After [[Kenya]] achieved independence, its government appointed him as Chief Justice and he moved there.\n\n===Independence (1962)===\n{{Main|Independence of Jamaica}}\n[[File:Charles Camilla Jamaica 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince Charles]] and the [[Duchess of Cornwall]] during a visit to Jamaica in 2008]]\n\nJamaica slowly gained increasing independence from the United Kingdom. In 1958, it became a province in the [[Federation of the West Indies]], a federation among the [[British West Indies]]. Jamaica attained full independence by leaving the federation in 1962.\n\nStrong economic growth, averaging approximately 6% per annum, marked the first ten years of independence under conservative [[Jamaica Labour Party]] governments; they were led successively by Prime Ministers [[Alexander Bustamante]], [[Donald Sangster]] and [[Hugh Shearer]]. The growth was fueled by strong private investments in [[bauxite]]/alumina, [[tourism]], the manufacturing industry and, to a lesser extent, the agricultural sector.\n\nThe optimism of the first decade was accompanied by a growing sense of inequality among many Afro-Jamaicans, and a concern that the benefits of growth were not being shared by the urban poor.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Combined with the effects of a slowdown in the global economy in 1970,{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} the voters elected the PNP ([[People's National Party]]) in 1972. They tried to implement more socially equitable policies in education and health, but the economy suffered under their leadership. By 1980, Jamaica's gross national product had declined to some 25% below the 1972 level. Due to rising foreign and local debt, accompanied by large fiscal deficits, the government sought [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) financing from the United States and others.\n\nEconomic deterioration continued into the mid-1980s, exacerbated by a number of factors. The first and third largest alumina producers, [[Alpart]] and [[Alcoa]], closed, and there was a significant reduction in production by the second-largest producer, [[Alcan]].

There was also a decline in tourism, which was important to the economy.\n\nIndependence, however widely celebrated in Jamaica, has been questioned in the early 21st century.

The current [[Queen of Jamaica]] is [[Elizabeth II]].<ref>Queen of Jamaica http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchAndCommonwealth/Jamaica/Jamaica.aspx</ref> As Elizabeth II is queen of [[Commonwealth realm|fifteen other countries]] and resides mostly in the United Kingdom, she is often represented by the [[Governor-General of Jamaica]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4923.asp |title=The Monarchy Today: Queen and Commonwealth |accessdate=25 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607011458/http://www.royal.gov.uk/output/Page4923.asp |archivedate=7 June 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe governor-general is nominated by the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]] and the entire Cabinet and then appointed by the monarch. All the members of the Cabinet are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the prime minister. The monarch and the governor-general serve largely ceremonial roles, apart from their [[reserve power]]s for use in certain constitutional crisis situations.\n\nJamaica's current [[constitution]] was drafted in 1962 by a bipartisan joint committee of the Jamaican legislature. It came into force with the Jamaica Independence Act, 1962 of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom parliament]], which gave Jamaica independence.\n\nThe [[Parliament of Jamaica]] is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], consisting of the House of Representatives (Lower House) and the Senate (Upper House). Members of the House (known as Members of Parliament or ''MPs'') are directly elected, and the member of the House of Representatives who, in the governor-general's best judgement, is best able to command the confidence of a majority of the members of that House, is appointed by the governor-general to be the prime minister. Senators are nominated jointly by the prime minister and the parliamentary [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] and are then appointed by the governor-general.\n\n===Political parties and elections===\nJamaica has traditionally had a [[two-party system]], with power often alternating between the [[People's National Party]] (PNP) and [[Jamaica Labour Party]] (JLP). The party with current administrative and legislative power is the Jamaica Labour Party, with a one-seat parliamentary majority {{As of|2016|lc=y}}. There are also several minor parties who have yet to gain a seat in parliament; the largest of these is the [[National Democratic Movement (Jamaica)|National Democratic Movement]] (NDM).\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Main|Parishes of Jamaica}}\n\nJamaica is divided into 14 [[Parishes of Jamaica|parishes]], which are grouped into three historic [[county|counties]] that have no administrative relevance.\n\nIn the context of [[local government]] the parishes are designated \"Local Authorities.\" These local authorities are further styled as \"Municipal Corporations,\" which are either city municipalities or town municipalities.<ref name=\"localgovernemtn\">{{cite web|title=Local Government Act, 2015|url=http://www.localauthorities.gov.jm/sites/default/files/resources/local_governance_bill_2015.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913220934/http://localauthorities.gov.jm/sites/default/files/resources/local_governance_bill_2015.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 September 2016|website=localauthorities.gov.jm|accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref> Any new city municipality must have a population of at least 50,000, and a town municipality a number set by the Minister of Local Government.<ref name=\"localgovernemtn\"/> There are currently no town municipalities.\n\nThe local governments of the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrews are consolidated as the city municipality of Kingston & St. Andrew Municipal Corporation.

The JDF is based on the British military model with similar organisation, training, weapons and traditions. Once chosen, officer candidates are sent to one of several British or Canadian basic officer courses depending on the arm of service. Enlisted soldiers are given basic training at Up Park Camp or JDF Training Depot, Newcastle, both in St. Andrew. As with the British model, NCOs are given several levels of professional training as they rise up the ranks. Additional military schools are available for speciality training in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nThe JDF is directly descended from the British Army's [[West India Regiment]] formed during the colonial era.<ref name=\"jdfhistory\">{{cite web|title=Jamaica Defense Force History|url=http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background2.php|publisher=Jamaica Defense Force|accessdate=10 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101025200223/http://www.jdfmil.org/overview/background/background2.php|archive-date=25 October 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The West India Regiment was used extensively by the British Empire in policing the empire from 1795 to 1926.

JDF units actively conduct armed patrols with the JCF in high-crime areas and known gang neighbourhoods. There has been vocal controversy as well as support of this JDF role. In early 2005, an Opposition leader, [[Edward Seaga]], called for the merger of the JDF and JCF.

The authorities have recognised the tremendous significance and potential of the environment and have designated some of the more 'fertile' areas as 'protected'. Among the island's protected areas are the [[Cockpit Country]], [[Jamaican dry forests|Hellshire Hills]], and Litchfield forest reserves.

Healthy oceans, coasts and freshwater ecosystems are crucial for economic growth and food production, but they are also fundamental to global efforts to mitigate climate change.<ref name=\":12\" /> Climate change also has an affect on the ocean and life within the ocean.\n\n=== Pollution ===\nPollution occurs everywhere in which could cause damage. Pollution comes from run-off, sewage systems, and garbage. However, this typically all ends up in the ocean after there is rain or floods. Everything that ends up in the water changes the quality and balance of the ocean. Poor coastal water quality has adversely affected fisheries, tourism and mariculture, as well as undermining biological sustainability of the living resources of ocean and coastal habitats.<ref name=\":22\" /> Jamaica imports and exports many goods through their waters. Some of the imports that go into Jamaica include petroleum and petroleum products. Issues include accidents at sea; risk of spills through local and international transport of petroleum and petroleum products.<ref name=\":22\" /> Oil spills can disrupt the marine life because the chemicals that are being spilled that should not be there. Oil and water do not mix. Unfortunately oil spills is not the only form of pollution that occurs in Jamaica. Solid waste disposal mechanisms in Jamaica are currently inadequate.<ref name=\":22\" /> The solid waste gets into the water through rainfall forces. Solid waste is also harmful to wildlife, particularly birds, fish and turtles that feed at the surface of the water and mistake floating debris for food.<ref name=\":22\" /> For example, plastic can be caught around birds and turtles necks making it difficult to eat and breath as they begin to grow causing the plastic to get tighter around their necks. Pieces of plastic, metal, and glass can be mistaken for the food fish eat. Each Jamaican generates 1&nbsp;kg (2&nbsp;lbs) of waste per day...only 70% of this is collected by National Solid Waste Management Authority (NSWMA)...the remaining 30% is either burnt or disposed of in gullies/waterways.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.un.org/Depts/los/consultative_process/documents/6_davis.pdf |title=MARINE DEBRIS: JAMAICA'S RESPONSE |date=6-10 June 2005 |website=www.un.org|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Policy ===\nThere are policies that are being put into place to help preserve the ocean and the life below water. The goal of integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) is to improve the quality of life of human communities who depend on coastal resources while maintaining the biological diversity and productivity of coastal ecosystems.<ref name=\":22\" /> Developing a underdeveloped country can impact the oceans ecosystem because of all the construction that would be done to develop the country. Over-building, driven by powerful market forces as well as poverty among some sectors of the population, and destructive exploitation contribute to the decline of ocean and coastal resources.<ref name=\":22\" /> Developing practices that will contribute to the lives of the people but also to the life of the ocean and its ecosystem. Some of these practices include: Develop sustainable fisheries practices, ensure sustainable mariculture techniques and practices, sustainable management of shipping, and promote sustainable tourism practices.<ref name=\":22\" /> As for tourism, tourism is the number one source of foreign exchange earnings in Jamaica and, as such is vital to the national economy.<ref name=\":22\" /> Tourist typically go to countries unaware of issues and how they impact those issues. Tourist are not going to be used to living in a different style compared to their own country. Practices such as: provide sewage treatment facilities for all tourist areas, determine carrying capacity of the environment prior to planning tourism activities, provide alternative types of tourist activities can help to get desired results such as the development of alternative tourism which will reduce the current pressure on resources that support traditional tourism activities.<ref name=\":22\" /> A study was conducted to see how tourist could help with sustainable financing for ocean and coastal management in Jamaica. Instead of using tourist fees they would call them environmental fees. This study aims to inform the relevant stakeholders of the feasibility of implementing environmental fees as well as the likely impact of such revenue generating instruments on the current tourist visitation rates to the island.<ref name=\":03\" /> The development of a user fee system would help fund environmental management and protection. The results show that tourists have a high consumer surplus associated with a vacation in Jamaica, and have a significantly lower willingness to pay for a tourism tax when compared to an environmental tax. The findings of the study show that the \u201clabel\u201d of the tax and as well as the respondent\u2019s awareness of the institutional mechanisms for environmental protection and tourism are important to their decision framework.<ref name=\":03\" /> Tourist are more willing to pay for environmental fees rather than tourist tax fees. A tax high enough to fund for environmental management and protection but low enough to continue to bring tourist to Jamaica. It has been shows that if an environmental tax of $1 per person were introduced it would not cause a significant decline in visitation rates and would generate revenues of US$1.7M.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Jamaica|Jamaican people}}\n\n===Ethnic origins===\n[[File:Jamaica-demography.png|thumb|Jamaica's population, 1961\u20132003]]\n[[File:Street in Montigo Bay Jamaica Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|The streets of [[Montego Bay, Jamaica]] ]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Other famous full African Jamaicans include the [[Jamaican Maroons|Maroons]] of Accompong and other settlements, who were the descendants of escaped slaves that introduced the [[jerk (cooking)|jerk cooking]] technique to the world. Many Maroons continue to have their own traditions and speak their own language, known locally as 'Kromanti'.\n\nIt is extremely uncommon for Jamaicans to identify themselves by race as is prominent in countries like the [[United States]] where the race of a person is hyphenated with the ethnicity proceeding the nationality, for example, the American usage of the terms, [[White Americans|White-American]] or [[African Americans|African-American]]. Due to its history, most Jamaicans describe their nationality as a race in and of itself where they identify as simply being 'Jamaican' regardless of ethnicity.<ref>http://jamaicans.com/jamaicanrace/ title=Out of Many One People, We Are A Race Apart</ref><ref name=\"jamaicans.com\"/>\n\nAsians form the second-largest group and include [[Indo-Jamaicans]] and [[Chinese Jamaicans]].<ref name=\"cia.gov\">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/jm.html CIA (The World Factbook): Jamaica</ref> Most are descended from indentured workers brought by the British colonial government to fill labour shortages following the abolition of slavery in 1838. Prominent Indian Jamaicans include jockey [[Shaun Bridgmohan]], who was the first Jamaican in the [[Kentucky Derby]], [[NBC Nightly News]] journalist [[Lester Holt]], and [[Miss Jamaica World]] and [[Miss Jamaica Universe|Miss Universe]] winner [[Yendi Phillips]]. The southwestern parish of [[Westmoreland Parish|Westmoreland]] is famous for its large population of [[Indo-Jamaicans]].<ref>http://www.jnht.com/disndat_people.php title= Jamaica National Heritage Trust - The People Who Came</ref>\n\nAlong with their Indian counterparts, [[Chinese Jamaicans]] have also played an integral part in Jamaica's community and history. Prominent descendants of this group include Canadian billionaire investor [[Michael Lee-Chin]], supermodels [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Tyson Beckford]], and [[VP Records]] founder [[Vincent \"Randy\" Chin]].\n\nThere are about 20,000 Jamaicans who have [[Lebanese Jamaicans|Lebanese]] ancestry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0056.htm |title=Out Of Many Cultures The People Who Came The Arrival Of The Lebanese}}</ref> Most were Christian immigrants who fled the Ottoman occupation in the early 19th century. Eventually, their descendants along with Syrian Jamaicans ([[Bob Marley]]), became very successful politicians and businessmen. Notable Jamaicans from this group include former Jamaican Prime Minister [[Edward Seaga]], Jamaican politician and former Miss World [[Lisa Hanna]], Jamaican politicians [[Edward Zacca]] and [[Shahine Robinson]], and hotelier [[Abraham Elias Issa]].\n\nIn 1835, Lord Seaford gave 500 acres of his 10,000 acre estate in Westmoreland for the Seaford Town German settlement. Today most of the town's descendants are of full or partial German descent.<ref>http://www.jnht.com/disndat_people.php Jamaica National Heritage Trust - The People Who Came</ref>\n\nThe first wave of [[English people|English]] immigrants arrived to the island 1655, after conquering the Spanish. Today, their descendants represent some of Jamaica's most celebrated representatives. Prominent descendants from this group include former [[Americans|American]] Governor of New York [[David Paterson]], Sandals Hotels owner [[Gordon \"Butch\" Stewart|Gordon Butch Stewart]], United States [[Senior Advisor to the President of the United States|Presidential Advisor]] and \"mother\" of the Pell Grant [[Lois Rice]], and former [[National Security Advisor (United States)|United States National Security Advisor]] and Ambassador to the United Nations [[Susan Rice]].\n\nThe first Irish immigrants came to Jamaica in the 1600s as war prisoners and later, indentured labor. Despite their very sordid arrival, their descendants became very accomplished men. Their descendants include two of [[Order of National Hero (Jamaica)|Jamaica's National Heros]]:  Prime Ministers [[Michael Manley]] and [[Alexander Bustamante]].\n\nAlong with the [[English people|English]] and the [[Irish people|Irish]], the [[Scottish people|Scots]] are another group that has made a significant impact on the island. According to the [[The Herald (Glasgow)|Scotland Herald newspaper]], Jamaica has more Campbell surnames, than the population of [[Scotland]] itself and it also has the highest percentage of Scottish surnames outside of Scotland. Scottish surnames account to about 60% of the surnames in the Jamaican phone books. The first Jamaican inhabitants from Scotland were exiled \"rebels\". Later, they would be followed by ambitious businessmen who spent time between their great country estates in Scotland and the island. As a result, many of the slave owning plantations on the island were owned by Scottish men and it resulted in the high occurrence of Jamaica's coloured (mixed-race) population. High immigration from Scotland  continued until well after independence. Today, notable Scottish-Jamaicans include Jamaican businessman John Pringle, former American Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], and American actress [[Kerry Washington]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Leask |first=David |date10 october 2005= |title=Jamaica: the country with more Campbells per head of population than Scotland |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/13839601.jamaica-the-country-with-more-campbells-per-head-of-population-than-scotland/ |work=Herald Scotland }}</ref>\n\n[[File:StreetsofKingston.jpg|thumb|The streets of [[Kingston, Jamaica]]]]\nThere is also a significant Portuguese Jamaican population that is predominantly of Sephardic [[History of the Jews in Jamaica|Jewish]] heritage that is primarily located in the [[Saint Elizabeth Parish]] in the southwestern part of Jamaica. The first Jews arrived as explorers from Spain in the 15th century after being forced to convert to Christianity or face death.

Many visitors to the island are often surprised to find many \"dark\" colored (mixed-race) Jamaicans with Jewish surnames. During the Holocaust, Jamaica became a refuge for Jews who faced expulsion.

The musical genres [[reggae]], [[ska]], [[mento]], [[rocksteady]], [[Dub music|dub]], and, more recently, [[dancehall]] and [[ragga]] all originated in the island's vibrant, popular urban recording industry. Jamaica also played an important role in the development of [[punk rock]], through reggae and ska. Reggae has also influenced American [[Hip hop music|rap]] music, as they share roots as rhythmic, African styles of music. Some rappers, such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Busta Rhymes]], and [[Heavy D]], are of Jamaican descent. Internationally known reggae musician [[Bob Marley]] was also Jamaican.\n\nMany other internationally known artists were born in Jamaica, including [[Millie Small]], [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]], [[Gregory Isaacs]], [[Half Pint]], [[Protoje]], [[Peter Tosh]], [[Bunny Wailer]], [[Big Youth]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], [[Dennis Brown]], [[Desmond Dekker]], [[Beres Hammond]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Shabba Ranks]], [[Super Cat]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Sean Paul]], [[I Wayne]], [[Bounty Killer]] and many others. Bands that came from Jamaica include [[Black Uhuru]], [[Third World Band]], [[Inner Circle (reggae band)|Inner Circle]], [[Chalice Reggae Band]], [[Culture (band)|Culture]], Fab Five and [[Morgan Heritage]]. The genre [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] emerged from London's Jamaican diaspora. The birth of [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] in New York City owed much to the city's Jamaican community.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Jamaican literature}}\n\nThe journalist and author [[H. G. de Lisser]] (1878\u20131944) used his native country as the setting for his many novels. Born in [[Falmouth, Jamaica]], de Lisser worked as a reporter for the ''[[Jamaica Times]]'' at a young age and in 1920 began publishing the magazine ''[[Planters' Punch]]''. ''The White Witch of Rosehall'' is one of his better-known novels. He was named Honorary President of the Jamaican Press Association; he worked throughout his professional career to promote the Jamaican sugar industry.\n\n[[Roger Mais]] (1905 \u2013 1955), a journalist, poet, and playwright wrote many short stories, plays, and novels, including ''The Hills Were Joyful Together'' (1953), ''Brother Man'' (1954), and ''Black Lightning'' (1955).\n\n[[Ian Fleming]] (1908-1964), who had a home in Jamaica where he spent considerable time, repeatedly used the island as a setting in his [[James Bond]] novels, including ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'', ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Doctor No]]'', \"[[For Your Eyes Only (short story)|For Your Eyes Only]]\", ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'', and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]''. In addition, James Bond uses a Jamaica-based cover in ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''. So far, the only James Bond film adaptation to have been set in Jamaica is ''[[Dr. No (film)|Doctor No]]''. Filming for the fictional island of [[James Bond locations#Locations depicted in films|San Monique]] in ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' took place in Jamaica.\n\n[[Marlon James (novelist)|Marlon James]] (1970), novelist has published three novels: ''John Crow's Devil'' (2005), ''[[The Book of Night Women]]'' (2009) and ''[[A Brief History of Seven Killings]]'' (2014), winner of the 2015 [[Man Booker Prize]].\n\n===Film===\n{{See also|List of Jamaican films}}\n\nThe cinema actor [[Errol Flynn]] lived with his third wife [[Patrice Wymore]] in [[Port Antonio]] in the 1950s.

A look at delinquent youth in Jamaica is presented in the 1970s musical crime film ''[[The Harder They Come]]'', starring [[Jimmy Cliff]] as a frustrated (and [[psychopathic]]) reggae musician who descends into a murderous crime spree. The American film ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'' (1988), starring [[Tom Cruise]], is one of the more popular films to depict Jamaica. Another popular Jamaican-based film is the 1993 Disney comedy ''[[Cool Runnings]]'', which is loosely based on the true story of Jamaica's first bobsled team trying to make it in the Winter Olympics.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Jamaican cuisine}}\n[[File:Curry Goat with rice and peas (in this case kidney beans).jpg|thumb|right|Jamaican [[Curry goat]] with [[rice and peas]].]]\nThe island is famous for its [[Jamaican jerk spice]], [[curry|curries]] and [[rice and peas]] which is integral to Jamaican cuisine.

In Jamaica it is not uncommon for young athletes to attain press coverage and national fame long before they arrive on the international athletics stage.\n\nOver the past six decades Jamaica has produced dozens of world class sprinters including Olympic and World Champion [[Usain Bolt]], world record holder in the 100m for men at 9.58s, and 200m for men at 19.19s.

American Olympic winner [[Sanya Richards-Ross]] was also born in Jamaica.\n\nJamaica has also produced several world class amateur and professional boxers including [[Trevor Berbick]] and [[Mike McCallum]]. First-generation Jamaican athletes have continued to make a significant impact on the sport internationally, especially in the United Kingdom where the list of top British boxers born in Jamaica or of Jamaican parents includes [[Lloyd Honeyghan]], [[Chris Eubank]], [[Audley Harrison]], [[David Haye]], [[Lennox Lewis]] and [[Frank Bruno]], [[Donovan Ruddock|Donovan \"Razor\" Ruddock]], [[Mike Tyson]], and [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], whose maternal grandfather is Jamaican.<ref>{{YouTube|gEAIWUxecvk|Floyd Mayweather is a Jamaican Yardie (big tings)}}</ref>\n\n[[Association football]] and [[horse-racing]] are other popular sports in Jamaica. The [[Jamaica National Football Team|national football team]] qualified for the 1998 [[FIFA World Cup]]. Horse racing was Jamaica's first sport. It was brought in the 1700s by British immigrants to satisfy their longing for their favorite pastime back at home. During slavery, the Afro-Jamaican slaves were considered the best horse jockeys. Today, horse racing provides jobs for about 20,000 people including horse breeders, groomers, and trainers. Also, several Jamaicans are known internationally for their success in horse racing including Richard DePass, who once held the Guinness Book of World Records for the most wins in a day, Canadian awards winner George HoSang, and American award winners Charlie Hussey, Andrew Ramgeet, and Barrington Harvey. Also, there are hundreds of Jamaicans who are employed in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom as exercise riders and groomers.<ref>{{cite news |last=Tortello |first=Dr. Rebecca |title=Jamaican Horse racing History: The sport of kings |url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/pages/history/story0078.html |work=Jamaica Gleaner |location=Jamaica |access-date=22 January 2019 }}</ref>\n\nRace car driving is also a popular sport in Jamaica with several car racing tracks and racing associations across the country.<ref>{{cite news |last=Graham |first=Neville |title=New Cars To Light Up Dover |url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/sports/20170415/new-cars-light-dover|work=Jamaica Gleaner |location=Jamaica |access-date=22 January 2019 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jamaica national bobsled team]] was once a serious contender in the [[Winter Olympics]], beating many well-established teams.

Most of these schools were established by the churches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jis.gov.jm/education/html/20041212T090000-0500_4438_JIS_MORAVIAN_CHURCH_CONTRIBUTING_MUCH_TO_EDUCATION.asp |title=Moravian Church Contribution to Education in Jamaica |accessdate=22 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123064227/http://www.jis.gov.jm/education/html/20041212T090000-0500_4438_JIS_MORAVIAN_CHURCH_CONTRIBUTING_MUCH_TO_EDUCATION.asp |archivedate=23 November 2007 }}</ref> This was the genesis of the modern Jamaican school system.\n\nPresently the following categories of schools exist:\n* '''Early childhood''' \u2013 Basic, infant and privately operated pre-school.

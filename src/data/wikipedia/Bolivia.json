The capital is [[Sucre]] while the [[seat of government]] and financial center is located in [[La Paz]]. The largest city and principal industrial center is [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], located on the [[Geography of Bolivia|Llanos Orientales]] (tropical lowlands) a mostly flat region in the east of Bolivia.\n\nThe [[sovereign state]] of Bolivia is a [[constitution of Bolivia|constitutionally]] [[unitary state]], divided into [[Departments of Bolivia|nine departments]]. Its geography varies from the peaks of the [[Andes]] in the West, to the Eastern Lowlands, situated within the [[Amazon Basin]]. It is bordered to the north and east by [[Brazil]], to the southeast by [[Paraguay]], to the south by [[Argentina]], to the southwest by [[Chile]], and to the northwest by [[Peru]]. One-third of the country is within the [[Andes|Andean]] mountain range. With {{convert|1,098,581|km2|abbr=on}} of area, Bolivia is the fifth largest country in [[South America]], the 27th largest in the world and the largest [[landlocked country]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]].\n\nThe country's population, estimated at 11&nbsp;million, is [[multiethnic]], including [[Amerindians]], [[Mestizo]]s, [[Europeans]], [[Asian people|Asian]]s and [[Africans]]. The [[Racial segregation|racial]] and [[social segregation]] that arose from Spanish colonialism has continued to the modern era. [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official and predominant language, although 36 [[Languages of Bolivia|indigenous language]]s also have official status, of which the most commonly spoken are [[Guarani dialects|Guarani]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and [[Quechuan languages|Quechua languages]].\n\nBefore Spanish colonization, the Andean region of Bolivia was part of the [[Inca Empire]], while the northern and eastern lowlands were inhabited by independent tribes. Spanish ''[[conquistadors]]'' arriving from [[Cuzco]] and [[Asunci\u00f3n]] took control of the region in the 16th century. During the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish colonial period]] Bolivia was administered by the [[Royal Audiencia of Charcas]]. Spain built its empire in large part upon the silver that was extracted from [[Mining in Bolivia|Bolivia's mines]].\nAfter the first call for independence in 1809, 16 years of war followed before the establishment of the Republic, named for [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. Over the course of the 19th and early 20th century Bolivia lost control of several peripheral territories to neighboring countries including the [[War of the Pacific|seizure]] of its coastline by Chile in 1879. Bolivia remained relatively politically stable until 1971, when [[Hugo Banzer]] led a [[History of Bolivia (1964\u201382)#The Banzer regime|coup d'\u00e9tat]] which replaced the socialist government of [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Torres]] with a [[military dictatorship]] headed by Banzer; Torres was murdered in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] by a right-wing death squad in 1976. Banzer's regime cracked down on [[left-wing politics|leftist and socialist]] opposition and other forms of dissent, resulting in the torture and deaths of a number of Bolivian citizens. Banzer was ousted in 1978 and later returned as the democratically elected president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001.\n\nModern Bolivia is a charter member of the [[United Nations|UN]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization|ACTO]], [[Bank of the South]], [[ALBA]] and [[Union of South American Nations|USAN]].

However, present-day Aymara associate themselves with the ancient civilization of the [[Tiwanaku culture]] which had its capital at [[Tiwanaku]], in Western Bolivia.

Tiwanaku expanded its reaches into the Yungas and brought its culture and way of life to many other cultures in Peru, Bolivia, and Chile. Tiwanaku was not a violent culture in many respects. In order to expand its reach, Tiwanaku exercised great political astuteness, creating colonies, fostering trade agreements (which made the other cultures rather dependent), and instituting state cults.<ref name=\"McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997\">{{cite journal|last=McAndrews|first=Timothy L.|author2=Albarracin-Jordan, Juan |author3=Bermann, Marc |title=Regional Settlement Patterns in the Tiwanaku Valley of Bolivia|journal=Journal of Field Archaeology|year=1997|volume=24|issue=1|pages=67\u201383|doi=10.2307/530562|jstor=530562}}</ref>\n\nThe empire continued to grow with no end in sight.

Tiwanaku's power was further solidified through the trade it implemented among the cities within its empire.<ref name=\"McAndrews, Timothy L. 1997\"/>\n\nTiwanaku's elites gained their status through the surplus food they controlled, collected from outlying regions and then redistributed to the general populace. Further, this elite's control of [[llama]] herds became a powerful control mechanism as llamas were essential for carrying goods between the civic centre and the periphery. These herds also came to symbolize class distinctions between the commoners and the elites. Through this control and manipulation of surplus resources, the elite's power continued to grow until about AD 950. At this time a dramatic shift in climate occurred,<ref name=\"Kolata, Alan L. 1993\">{{cite book|last=Kolata|first=Alan L. |title=The Tiwanaku: Portrait of an Andean Civilization|date=8 December 1993|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-55786-183-2}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2013}} causing a significant drop in precipitation in the Titicaca Basin, believed by archaeologists to have been on the scale of a major drought.\n\nAs the rainfall decreased, many of the cities farther away from Lake Titicaca began to tender fewer foodstuffs to the elites. As the surplus of food decreased, and thus the amount available to underpin their power, the control of the elites began to falter. The capital city became the last place viable for food production due to the resiliency of the raised field method of agriculture. Tiwanaku disappeared around AD 1000 because food production, the main source of the elites' power, dried up. The area remained uninhabited for centuries thereafter.<ref name=\"Kolata, Alan L. 1993\"/>\n\n[[File:Inca_Expansion.svg|thumb|Inca Expansion (1438\u20131533)]]\n\nBetween 1438 and 1527, the Inca empire, during its expansion from its capital at [[Cuzco]], [[Peru]].

That revolution was followed by the [[La Paz revolution]] on 16 July 1809. The La Paz revolution marked a complete split with the Spanish government, while the Chuquisaca Revolution established a local independent junta in the name of the Spanish King deposed by Napoleon Bonaparte. Both revolutions were short-lived and defeated by the Spanish authorities in the Viceroyalty of the Rio de La Plata, but the following year the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] raged across the continent.\n\nBolivia was captured and recaptured many times during the war by the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]] and patriots.

Bolivia was finally freed of Royalist dominion by Marshal [[Antonio Jos\u00e9 de Sucre]], with a military campaign coming from the North in support of the campaign of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]. After 16 years of war the Republic was [[Bolivian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed]] on 6 August 1825.\n\n[[File:Coat of arms of Bolivia (1825).svg|thumb|The first coat of arms of Bolivia, formerly named the Republic of Bol\u00edvar in honor of [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\n\nIn 1836, Bolivia, under the rule of [[Marshal]] [[Andr\u00e9s de Santa Cruz]], invaded Peru to reinstall the deposed president, [[General]] [[Luis Jos\u00e9 de Orbegoso]]. Peru and Bolivia formed the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]], with de Santa Cruz as the ''Supreme Protector''. Following tension between the Confederation and Chile, Chile declared war on 28 December 1836. Argentina separately declared war on the Confederation on 9 May 1837. The Peruvian-Bolivian forces achieved several major victories during the [[War of the Confederation]]: the defeat of the Argentine expedition and the defeat of the first Chilean expedition on the fields of [[Paucarpata District|Paucarpata]] near the city of [[Arequipa]].\n\nAt the outset of the war, the Chilean and Peruvian rebel army surrendered unconditionally and signed the [[Paucarpata Treaty]]. The treaty stipulated that Chile would withdraw from Peru-Bolivia, Chile would return captured Confederate ships, economic relations would be normalized, and the Confederation would pay Peruvian debt to Chile. In Chile, the government and public rejected the peace treaty. Chile organized a second attack on the Confederation and defeated it in the [[Battle of Yungay]]. After this defeat, Santa Cruz resigned and went to exile in [[Ecuador]] and then Paris, and the Peruvian-Bolivian Confederation was dissolved.\n\nFollowing the renewed independence of Peru, Peruvian president General [[Agust\u00edn Gamarra]] invaded Bolivia. The Peruvian army was decisively defeated at the [[Battle of Ingavi]] on 20 November 1841 where Gamarra was killed. The Bolivian army under General [[Jos\u00e9 Ballivi\u00e1n]] then mounted a counter-offensive, capturing the Peruvian port of [[Arica Province (Peru)|Arica]]. Later, both sides signed a [[peace treaty]] in 1842, putting a final end to the war. The estimated population of the main three cities in 1843 was La Paz 300,000, Cochabamba 250,000 and Potosi 200,000.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol III'', London, Charles Knight, 1847, p.528.</ref>\n\nA period of political and economic instability in the early-to-mid-19th century weakened Bolivia. In addition, during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u201383), [[Chile]] occupied vast territories rich in [[natural resources]] south west of Bolivia, including the Bolivian [[coast]]. Chile took control of today's [[Chuquicamata]] area, the adjoining rich ''salitre'' ([[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]]) fields, and the port of [[Antofagasta]] among other Bolivian territories.\n\nThus, since independence, Bolivia has lost over half of its territory to neighboring countries.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGurn Centellas |first=Katherine |date=June 2008 |title=For Love of Land and Laboratory: Nation-building and Bioscience in Bolivia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXD4SlJQYDgC&pg=PA97|location=Chicago |isbn=9780549565697 }}</ref> It also lost the [[Acre (state)|state of Acre]], in the [[Acre War]], important because this region was known for its production of rubber.

The relatively robust economic growth of the mid-1990s continued until about the third year of its term in office. After that, regional, global and domestic factors contributed to a decline in economic growth. Financial crises in Argentina and Brazil, lower world prices for export commodities, and reduced employment in the coca sector depressed the Bolivian economy. The public also perceived a significant amount of public sector corruption. These factors contributed to increasing social protests during the second half of Banzer's term.\n\nBetween January 1999 and April 2000, large-scale [[2000 Cochabamba protests|protests]] erupted in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia's third largest city, in response to the [[Water privatization|privatisation of water]] resources by foreign companies and a subsequent doubling of water prices.

The MNR platform featured three overarching objectives: economic reactivation (and job creation), anti-[[political corruption|corruption]], and social inclusion.\n\nIn 2003 the [[Bolivian gas conflict]] broke out. On 12 October 2003 the government imposed martial law in El Alto after 16 people were shot by the police and several dozen wounded in violent clashes. Faced with the option of resigning or more bloodshed, Sanchez de Lozada offered his resignation in a letter to an emergency session of Congress. After his resignation was accepted and his vice president, [[Carlos Mesa]], invested, he left on a commercially scheduled flight for the United States.\n\nThe country's internal situation became unfavorable for such political action on the international stage. After a resurgence of gas protests in 2005, Carlos Mesa attempted to resign in January 2005, but his offer was refused by Congress. On 22 March 2005, after weeks of new street protests from organizations accusing Mesa of bowing to U.S. corporate interests, Mesa again offered his resignation to Congress, which was accepted on 10 June.

The rivers of this basin generally have big [[meander]]s which form lakes such as [[Murillo Lake]] in [[Pando Department]].

The Beni River, along with the [[Madeira River]], forms the main tributary of the [[Amazon River]]. From east to west, the basin is formed by other important rivers, such as the [[Madre de Dios River]], the [[Orthon River]], the [[Abuna River]], the [[Yata River]], and the [[Guapor\u00e9 River]]. The most important lakes are [[Rogaguado Lake]], [[Rogagua Lake]], and [[Jara Lake]].\n*The second is the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]], also called the South Basin ({{convert|229500|km\u00b2|sqmi|abbr=on}}/21% of the territory). The tributaries in this basin are in general less abundant than the ones forming the Amazon Basin. The Rio de la Plata Basin is mainly formed by the [[Paraguay River]], [[Pilcomayo River]], and [[Bermejo River]]. The most important lakes are [[Uberaba Lake]] and [[Mandior\u00e9 Lake]], both located in the Bolivian marshland.\n*The third basin is the '''Central Basin''', which is an [[endorheic basin]] ({{convert|145081|km\u00b2|sqmi}}/13% of the territory). The ''[[Altiplano]]'' has large numbers of lakes and rivers that do not run into any ocean because they are enclosed by the Andean mountains.

Presidents [[Hern\u00e1n Siles Zuazo]] (1982\u201385) and [[V\u00edctor Paz Estenssoro]] (1985\u201389) began a tradition of ceding power peacefully which has continued, although two presidents have stepped down in the face of popular protests: [[Gonzalo S\u00e1nchez de Lozada]] in 2003 and [[Carlos Mesa]] in 2005.\n\nBolivia's multiparty democracy has seen a wide variety of parties in the presidency and parliament, although the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]], [[Nationalist Democratic Action]], and the [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Left Movement]] predominated from 1985 to 2005. The current president is [[Evo Morales]], the first indigenous Bolivian to serve as head of state. Morales' [[Movement for Socialism \u2013 Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples]] party was the first to win an outright presidential majority in four decades, doing so both in 2005 and 2009.\n\nThe [[Constitution of Bolivia|constitution]], drafted in 2006\u201307 and approved in 2009, provides for balanced executive, legislative, judicial, and electoral powers, as well as several levels of autonomy. The traditionally strong executive branch tends to overshadow the [[National Congress of Bolivia|Congress]], whose role is generally limited to debating and approving legislation initiated by the executive. The judiciary, consisting of the [[Supreme Court of Bolivia|Supreme Court]] and departmental and lower courts, has long been riddled with corruption and inefficiency. Through revisions to the constitution in 1994, and subsequent laws, the government has initiated potentially far-reaching reforms in the judicial system as well as increasing decentralizing powers to departments, municipalities, and indigenous territories.\n\nThe executive branch is headed by a president and vice president, and consists of a variable number (currently, 20) of government [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. The president is elected to a five-year term by [[Direct election|popular vote]], and governs from the Presidential Palace (popularly called the Burnt Palace, ''Palacio Quemado'') in La Paz. In the case that no candidate receives an [[absolute majority]] of the popular vote or more than 40% of the vote with an advantage of more than 10% over the second-place finisher, a run-off is to be held among the two candidates most voted.<ref name=\"presidencia.gob.bo\"/>\n\nThe ''Asamblea Legislativa Plurinacional'' ([[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] or National Congress) has [[Bicameralism|two chambers]]. The ''C\u00e1mara de Diputados'' (Chamber of Deputies) has 130 members elected to five-year terms, seventy from single-member districts (''circunscripciones''), sixty by proportional representation, and seven by the minority indigenous peoples of seven departments.<!-- 70 + 60 + 7 = 137. Can someone clarify how National Congress has 130 members while, appearently, 137 is elected --> The ''C\u00e1mara de Senadores'' (Chamber of Senators) has 36 members (four per department).

At the end of 2002, the government owed $4.5 billion to its foreign [[creditor]]s, with $1.6 billion of this amount owed to other governments and most of the balance owed to multilateral development banks. Most payments to other governments have been rescheduled on several occasions since 1987 through the [[Paris Club]] mechanism.

However, by 2013 the foreign assistance is just a fraction of the government budget thanks to tax collection mainly from the profitable exports to Brazil and Argentina of natural gas.\n\nThe income from tourism has become increasingly important.

However, the country has the continent's lowest coverage levels and services are of low quality.

The country's second largest city, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], manages its own water and sanitation system relatively successfully by way of cooperatives. The government of [[Evo Morales]] intends to strengthen citizen participation within the sector. Increasing coverage requires a substantial increase of investment financing.\n\nAccording to the government the main problems in the sector are low access to sanitation throughout the country; low access to water in rural areas; insufficient and ineffective investments; a low visibility of community service providers; a lack of respect of indigenous customs; \"technical and institutional difficulties in the design and implementation of projects\"; a lack of capacity to operate and maintain infrastructure; an institutional framework that is \"not consistent with the political change in the country\"; \"ambiguities in the social participation schemes\"; a reduction in the quantity and \nquality of water due to climate change; pollution and a lack of integrated water resources management; and the lack of policies and programs for the reuse of wastewater.<ref name=\"PNSB\">Estado Plurinacional de Bolivia:[http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf Plan Nacional de Saneamiento Basico 2008\u20132015] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228092846/http://www.mmaya.gob.bo/documentos/pnsb_final.pdf |date=28 February 2013 }}, retrieved on September 30, 2010</ref>\n\nOnly 27% of the population has access to [[improved sanitation]], 80 to 88% has access to [[improved water source]]s.

The [[Islands of Equatorial Guinea|insular region]] consists of the islands of [[Bioko]] (formerly ''Fernando P\u00f3'') in the Gulf of Guinea and [[Annob\u00f3n Province|Annob\u00f3n]], a small volcanic island which is the only part of the country south of the [[equator]]. Bioko Island is the northernmost part of Equatorial Guinea and is the site of the country's capital, [[Malabo]]. The Portuguese speaking island nation of [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] is located between Bioko and Annob\u00f3n. The mainland region, [[R\u00edo Muni]], is bordered by [[Cameroon]] on the north and [[Gabon]] on the south and east. It is the location of [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]], Equatorial Guinea's largest city, and [[Ciudad de la Paz]], the country's planned future capital. Rio Muni also includes several small offshore islands, such as [[Corisco]], [[Elobey Grande]], and [[Elobey Chico]]. The country is a member of the [[African Union]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], [[OPEC]] and the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries|CPLP]].\n\nSince the mid-1990s, Equatorial Guinea has become one of [[sub-Saharan Africa]]'s largest oil producers.

The [[Annobonese Creole|Annob\u00f3n]] population, originally native to [[Angola]], was introduced by the Portuguese via [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 island]].\n\n===First European contact (1472)===\nThe [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese explorer]] [[Fern\u00e3o do P\u00f3|Fernando P\u00f3]], seeking a path to [[India]], is credited as being the first European to discover the island of Bioko in 1472. He called it ''Formosa'' (\"Beautiful\"), but it quickly took on the name of its European discoverer. [[Fernando P\u00f3 (island)|Fernando P\u00f3]] and Annob\u00f3n were colonized by [[Portugal]] in 1474.\n\nIn 1778, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]] and King [[Charles III of Spain]] signed the [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|Treaty of El Pardo]] which ceded [[Bioko]], adjacent islets, and commercial rights to the [[Bight of Bonny|Bight of Biafra]] between the [[Niger River|Niger]] and [[Ogoue River|Ogoue]] rivers to [[Spanish Empire|Spain]]. Spain thereby tried to gain access to a source of slaves controlled by British merchants. Between 1778 and 1810, the territory of Equatorial Guinea was administered by the [[Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], based in [[Buenos Aires]].\n\nFrom 1827 to 1843, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] had a base on [[Bioko]] to control the [[slavery|slave trade]],<ref>\"Fernando Po\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911.</ref> which was moved to [[Sierra Leone]] under an agreement with Spain in 1843. In 1844, on restoration of Spanish sovereignty, the area became known as the \"Territorios Espa\u00f1oles del Golfo de Guinea.\" Spain had neglected to occupy the large area in the [[Bight of Biafra]] to which it had right by [[treaty]], and the French had busily expanded their occupation at the expense of the area claimed by Spain. The [[Treaty of Paris (1900)|treaty of Paris]] in 1900 left Spain with the continental [[enclave]] of Rio Muni, a mere 26,000&nbsp;km{{sup|2}} out of the 300,000 stretching east to the [[Ubangi River|Ubangi river]] which the Spaniards had initially claimed.<ref name=Clarence-Smith>Clarence-Smith, William Gervase (1986) [http://es.scribd.com/doc/63545279/The-Cambridge-History-of-Africa-Volume-7-From-1905-to-1940-0521225051-1986 \"Spanish Equatorial Guinea, 1898\u20131940\"] in ''The Cambridge History of Africa: From 1905 to 1940'' Ed.

The British occupied the island briefly in the early 19th century, settling some 2,000 Sierra Leoneans and freed slaves there. Limited immigration from West Africa and the West Indies continued after the British left. To this were added Cubans, Filipinos and Spaniards of various colours deported for political or other crimes, as well as some assisted settlers.\n\nThere was also a trickle of immigration from the neighbouring Portuguese islands, escaped slaves and prospective planters. Although a few of the [[Fernandino peoples|Fernandinos]] were Catholic and Spanish-speaking, about nine-tenths of them were Protestant and English-speaking on the eve of the First World War, and [[pidgin English]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the island. The Sierra Leoneans were particularly well placed as planters while labor recruitment on the [[Ivory Coast|Windward coast]] continued, for they kept family and other connections there and could easily arrange a supply of labor.\n\nThe opening years of the twentieth century saw a new generation of Spanish immigrants. Land regulations issued in 1904\u20131905 favoured Spaniards, and most of the later big planters arrived from Spain after that. The Liberian labor agreement of 1914{{clarify|date=November 2017}} favoured wealthy men with ready access to the state, and the shift in labor supplies from Liberia to Rio Muni increased this advantage. In 1940, an estimated 20% of the colony's cocoa production came from African-owned land, nearly all of it was in the hands of Fernandinos.\n\n[[File:Corisco-Saliendo de misa-1910.jpg|thumb|[[Corisco]], 1910]]\nThe greatest constraint to [[economic development]] was a chronic shortage of labour.  Pushed into the interior of the island and decimated by alcohol addiction, venereal disease, [[smallpox]], and [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], the indigenous [[Bubi people|Bubi]] population of [[Bioko]] refused to work on [[plantation]]s. Working their own small [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] farms gave them a considerable degree of autonomy.\n\nBy the late nineteenth century, the Bubi were protected from the demands of the planters by Spanish [[Claretians|Claretian]] missionaries, who were very influential in the colony and eventually organised the Bubi into little mission theocracies reminiscent of the famous [[Jesuit]] [[Reducciones|reductions]] in [[Paraguay]]. Catholic penetration was furthered by two small insurrections in 1898 and 1910 protesting [[conscription]] of [[Forced labor|forced labour]] for the plantations. The Bubi were disarmed in 1917, and left dependent on the missionaries.<ref name=\"Clarence-Smith\" />\n\nBetween 1926 and 1959 Bioko and Rio Muni were united as the colony of [[Spanish Guinea]]. The economy was based on large [[cocoa bean|cacao]] and [[coffee]] plantations and [[logging]] concessions and the workforce was mostly immigrant [[contract labour]] from [[Liberia]], [[Nigeria]], and [[Cameroun]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Martino, Enrique|title=Clandestine Recruitment Networks in the Bight of Biafra: Fernando P\u00f3's Answer to the Labour Question, 1926\u20131945|journal=International Review of Social History|volume=57|pages=39\u201372|url=http://www.opensourceguinea.org/2013/03/enrique-martino-clandestine-recruitment.html|doi=10.1017/s0020859012000417|year=2012}}</ref> Between 1914 and 1930, an estimated 10,000 Liberians went to Fernando Po under a labour treaty that was stopped altogether in 1930.\n\nWith Liberian workers no longer available, planters of Fernando Po turned to Rio Muni. Campaigns were mounted to subdue the [[Fang people]] in the 1920s, at the time that Liberia was beginning to cut back on recruitment. There were garrisons of the colonial guard throughout the enclave by 1926, and the whole colony was considered 'pacified' by 1929.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/14636204.2013.790703|title=La \u00faltima selva de Espa\u00f1a: Antrop\u00f3fagos, misioneros y guardias civiles.

Also, the [[timber]] companies needed increasing numbers of workers, and the spread of [[coffee]] cultivation offered an alternative means of paying taxes{{clarify|date=November 2016}}.

The first phase consisted of little more than a continuation of previous policies; these closely resembled the policies of Portugal and France, notably in dividing the population into a vast majority governed as 'natives' or non-citizens, and a very small minority (together with whites) admitted to civic status as ''[[emancipados]]'', [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] to the metropolitan culture being the only permissible means of advancement.<ref>Crowder, Michael, ed.

Like all previous elections, this was denounced by the opposition and it too was won by Obiang's PDGE. During the electoral contest, the ruling party hosted internal elections which were later scrapped as none of the president's favorite candidates led the internal lists. Ultimately, the ruling party and the satellites of the ruling coalition decided to run not based on the candidates but based on the party. This created a situation where during the election the ruling party's coalition did not provide the names of their candidates so effectively individuals were not running for office, instead the party was the one running for office.\n\nThe May 2013 elections were marked by a series of events including the popular protest planned by a group of activists from the MPP (Movement of Popular Protest) which included several social and political groups. The MPP called for a peaceful protest at the Plaza de la Mujer square on 15 May. MPP coordinator Enrique Nsolo Nzo was arrested and official state media portrayed him as planning to destabilize the country and depose the president. However, and despite speaking under duress and with clear signs of torture, Nsolo said that they had planned a peaceful protest and had indeed obtained all the legal authorizations required to carry out the peaceful protest. In addition to that, he firmly stated that he was not affiliated with any political party. The Plaza de la Mujer square in Malabo was occupied by the police from 13 May and it has been heavily guarded ever since. The government embarked on a [[censorship]] program that affected social sites including Facebook and other websites that were critical to the government of Equatorial Guinea.

The [[official language]] is [[Slovak language|Slovak]].\n\nThe [[Slavs]] arrived in the territory of present-day Slovakia in the 5th and 6th centuries. In the 7th century, they played a significant role in the creation of [[Samo's Empire]] and in the 9th century established the [[Principality of Nitra]], which was later conquered by the [[Principality of Moravia]] to establish [[Great Moravia]].

The area was recovered largely thanks to [[B\u00e9la IV of Hungary]] who also settled [[Zipser Germans|Germans]] which became an important ethnic group in the area, especially in what are today parts of [[Hauerland|central]] and eastern Slovakia. After [[World War I]] and the dissolution of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the Czechoslovak National Council established [[Czechoslovakia]] (1918\u20131939). A separate (First) [[Slovak Republic (1939\u201345)|Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)]] existed during [[World War\u00a0II]] as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]], [[Clerical fascism|clero-fascist]] [[One-party state|one-party]] [[client state]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. At the end of World War II, Czechoslovakia was re-established as an independent country. A [[1948 Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat|coup in 1948]] ushered in a totalitarian one-party state under the [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948\u201389)|Communist regime]] during whose rule the country existed as a [[Satellite state|satellite]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. Attempts for [[Socialism with a human face|liberalization of communism]] in Czechoslovakia culminated in the [[Prague Spring]], which was crushed by the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968. In 1989, the [[Velvet Revolution]] ended the Communist rule in Czechoslovakia peacefully. Slovakia became an independent state on 1 January 1993 after the peaceful [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]], sometimes known as the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Velvet Divorce]].\n\nSlovakia is a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] [[Developed country|advanced economy]]<ref name=\"World Bank Country Classification\">{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html#High_income|title=Country and Lending Groups|work=worldbank.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2009/01/weodata/weoselco.aspx?g=110&sg=All+countries+%2f+Advanced+economies |title=Advanced economies |publisher=IMF |date=14 September 2006 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> with a very high [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]],<ref name=HighOECD>[http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups#OECD_members Country and Lending Groups |Data].

The most well-known finds include the oldest female statue made of [[mammoth]]-bone (22,800&nbsp;BCE), the famous [[Venus of Moravany]]. The statue was found in the 1940s in [[Moravany nad V\u00e1hom]] near [[Pie\u0161\u0165any]]. Numerous necklaces made of shells from Cypraca thermophile [[gastropoda|gastropods]] of the [[Tertiary]] period have come from the sites of Z\u00e1kovsk\u00e1, Podkovice, Hubina, and Rado\u0161ina. These findings provide the most ancient evidence of commercial exchanges carried out between the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and central Europe.\n\n=== Bronze Age ===\n[[File:Web Biatec.jpg|thumb|Left: a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Biatec]] coin<br />Right: five [[Slovak koruna|Slovak crowns]]]]\nThe [[Bronze Age]] in the geographical territory of modern-day Slovakia went through three stages of development, stretching from 2000 to 800&nbsp;BCE. <!--I am not sure what the following sentences mean, so I put them into this comment: To this there period belongs the well-known funeral culture of the Carpathians and that of the middle [[Danube]]. During the later Neolithic Age a considerable growth in cultural regions took place in Slovakia.--> Major cultural, economic, and political development can be attributed to the significant growth in production of copper, especially in central Slovakia (for example in [[\u0160pania Dolina]]) and northwest Slovakia. Copper became a stable source of prosperity for the local population.\n\nAfter the disappearance of the \u010cakany and [[Velatice]] cultures, the [[Lusatian culture|Lusatian]] people expanded building of strong and complex fortifications, with the large permanent buildings and administrative centres. Excavations of Lusatian [[Hillfort|hill forts]] document the substantial development of trade and agriculture at that period. The richness and the diversity of tombs increased considerably. The inhabitants of the area manufactured arms, shields, jewellery, dishes, and statues.\n\n=== Iron Age ===\n\n==== Hallstatt Period ====\nThe arrival of tribes from [[Thrace]] disrupted the people of the [[Kalenderberg culture]], who lived in the hamlets located on the plain ([[Sere\u010f]]) and in the hill forts like Molp\u00edr, near [[Smolenice]], in the [[Little Carpathians]]. During Hallstatt times, monumental burial mounds were erected in western Slovakia, with princely equipment consisting of richly decorated vessels, ornaments and decorations. The burial rites consisted entirely of cremation. The common people were buried in flat urnfield cemeteries. A special role was given to weaving and the production of textiles. The local power of the \"Princes\" of the [[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt period]] disappeared in Slovakia during the last century before the middle of first millennium BC, after strife between the [[Scythians|Scytho]]-Thracian people and locals, resulting in abandonment of the old hill-forts. Relatively depopulated areas soon caught interest of emerging [[Celts|Celtic]] tribes, who advanced from the south towards the north, following the Slovak rivers, peacefully integrating into the remnants of the local population.\n\n==== La T\u00e8ne Period ====\nFrom around 500&nbsp;BCE, the territory of modern-day Slovakia was settled by [[Celt]]s, who built powerful ''[[oppida]]'' on the sites of modern-day [[Bratislava]] and [[Dev\u00edn]]. [[Biatec]]s, [[silver coin]]s with inscriptions in the Latin alphabet, represent the first known use of writing in Slovakia. At the northern regions, remnants of the local population of Lusatian origin, together with Celtic and later Dacian influence, gave rise to the unique [[P\u00fachov culture]], with advanced crafts and iron-working, many hill-forts and fortified settlements of central type with coinage of the \"Velkobysterecky\" type (no inscriptions, with a horse on one side and a head on the other). This culture is often connected with the Celtic tribe mentioned in Roman sources as [[Cotini]].\n\n==== Roman Period ====\n[[File:Trencin-Roman2.JPG|thumb|A Roman inscription at the castle hill of [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]] (178\u2013179 AD)]]\nFrom 2&nbsp;[[Anno Domini|AD]], the expanding [[Roman Empire]] established and maintained a series of outposts around and just south of the [[Danube]], the largest of which were known as [[Carnuntum]] (whose remains are on the main road halfway between Vienna and Bratislava) and [[Brigetio]] (present-day [[Sz\u0151ny]] at the Slovak-Hungarian border). Such Roman border settlements were built on the present area of [[Rusovce]], currently a suburb of Bratislava. The military fort was surrounded by a civilian [[vicus]] and several farms of the [[villa rustica]] type. The name of this settlement was [[Gerulata]]. The military fort had an auxiliary cavalry unit, approximately 300 horses strong, modelled after the [[Cananefates]].

In 1919, during the chaos following the break-up of Austria-Hungary, Czechoslovakia was formed with numerous Germans and Hungarians within the newly set borders.

The word \"socialist\" was dropped in the names of the two republics, i.e. the Slovak Socialist Republic was renamed Slovak Republic. In July 17, 1992 Slovakia, led by Prime Minister [[Vladim\u00edr Me\u010diar]], declared itself a sovereign state, meaning that its laws took precedence over those of the federal government. Throughout the autumn of 1992, Me\u010diar and [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Czech Prime Minister]] [[V\u00e1clav Klaus]] negotiated the details for disbanding the federation. In November the federal parliament voted to dissolve the country officially on 31 December 1992.\n\nThe Slovak Republic and the [[Czech Republic]] went their separate ways after 1 January 1993, an event sometimes called the [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|Velvet Divorce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakia.org/history-topics |title=The Breakup of Czechoslovakia |publisher=Slovakia |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/velvet+divorce |title=Velvet divorce |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=3 June 2011}}</ref> Slovakia has remained a close partner with the Czech Republic.

The weather differs from the mountainous north to the plains in the south.\n\nThe warmest region is [[Bratislava]] and Southern Slovakia where the temperatures may reach {{convert|30|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in summer, occasionally to {{convert|39|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} in [[Hurbanovo]]. During night, the temperatures drop to {{convert|20|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. The daily temperatures in winter average in the range of {{convert|-5|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}. During night it may be freezing, but usually not below {{convert|-10|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn Slovakia, there are [[Season|four seasons]], each season (Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter) lasts three months. The dry continental air brings in the summer heat and winter frosts. In contrast, oceanic air brings rainfalls and reduces summer temperatures.

Showers or thunderstorms may occur because of the summer monsoon called Medardova kvapka (Medard drop \u2013 40 days of rain). Summer in Northern Slovakia is usually mild with temperatures around {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} (less in the mountains).\n\n[[Autumn]] in Slovakia starts on 23 September and is mostly characterised by wet weather and wind, although the first weeks can be very warm and sunny. The average temperature in September is around {{convert|14|\u00b0C|0}}, in November to {{convert|3|\u00b0C|0}}. Late September and early October is a dry and sunny time of year (so-called Indian Summer).\n\n[[Winter]] starts on 21 December with temperatures around {{convert|-5|to|-10|C|F}}. In December and January it is usually snowing, these are the coldest months of the year. At lower altitudes, snow does not stay the whole winter, it is changing into the thaw and frost.

The best known castles include [[Bojnice Castle]] (often used as a filming location), [[Spi\u0161 Castle]], (on the UNESCO list), [[Orava Castle]], [[Bratislava Castle]], and the ruins of [[Dev\u00edn Castle]]. [[\u010cachtice Castle]] was once the home of the world's most prolific female serial killer, the 'Bloody Lady', [[Elizabeth B\u00e1thory]].\n\nSlovakia's position in Europe and the country's past (part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Habsburg]] monarchy and [[Czechoslovakia]]) made many cities and towns similar to the cities in the [[Czech Republic]] (such as [[Prague]]), [[Austria]] (such as [[Salzburg]]) or [[Hungary]] (such as [[Budapest]]). A historical center with at least one square has been preserved in many towns. Large historical centers can be found in [[Bratislava]], [[Tren\u010d\u00edn]], [[Ko\u0161ice]], [[Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica]], [[Levo\u010da]], and [[Trnava]]. Historical centers have been going through restoration in recent years.\n\nHistorical churches can be found in virtually every village and town in Slovakia. Most of them are built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, but there are also many examples of [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]], for example [[Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica]], Bardejov and [[Spi\u0161sk\u00e1 Kapitula]]. The [[Basilica of St. James, Levo\u010da|Basilica of St. James]] in Levo\u010da with the tallest wood-carved altar in the world and the Church of the Holy Spirit in [[\u017dehra]] with medieval [[fresco]]s are UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]s. The [[St. Martin's Concathedral]] in [[Bratislava]] served as the [[coronation]] church for the Kingdom of Hungary. The oldest sacral buildings in Slovakia stem from the [[Great Moravia]]n period in the 9th century.\nVery precious structures are the complete wooden churches of northern and northern-eastern Slovakia. Most were built from the 15th century onwards by [[Catholic]]s, [[Lutheran]]s and members of [[Eastern Christianity|eastern-rite]] churches.\n\nTypical souvenirs from Slovakia are dolls dressed in folk costumes, ceramic objects, crystal glass, carved wooden figures, [[\u010drp\u00e1k]]s (wooden pitchers), [[fujara]]s (a [[folk instrument]] on the UNESCO list) and [[vala\u0161ka]]s (a decorated folk hatchet) and above all products made from [[husk|corn husks]] and wire, notably human figures. Souvenirs can be bought in the shops run by the state organisation \u00da\u013dUV (''\u00dastredie \u013eudovej umeleckej v\u00fdroby'' \u2013 Centre of [[Folk art|Folk Art]] Production). ''Dielo'' shop chain sells works of Slovak artists and craftsmen. These shops are mostly found in towns and cities.\n\nPrices of imported products are generally the same as in the neighbouring countries, whereas prices of local products and services, especially food, are usually lower.\n\n=== Science ===\nThe [[Slovak Academy of Sciences]] has been the most important scientific and research institution in the country since 1953. Slovaks have made notable scientific and technical contributions during the history. Slovakia is currently in the negotiation process of becoming a member of the [[European Space Agency]].

The education system consists of elementary school which is divided into two parts, the first grade (age 6\u201310) and the second grade (age 10\u201315) which is finished by taking nationwide testing called Monitor, from Slovak language and math. Parents may apply for social assistance for a child that is studying on an elementary school or a high-school. If approved, the state provides basic study necessities for the child. Schools provide books to all their students with usual exceptions of books for studying a foreign language and books which require taking notes in them, which are mostly present at the first grade of elementary school.\n\nAfter finishing elementary school, students are obliged to take one year in high school.\n\nAfter finishing a high school, students can go to university and are highly encouraged to do so. Slovakia has a wide range of universities. The biggest university is [[Comenius University]], established in 1919. Although it's not the first university ever established on Slovak territory, it's the oldest university that is still running. Most universities in Slovakia are public funded, where anyone can apply. Every citizen has a right to free education in public schools.\n\nSlovakia has several privately funded universities, however public universities consistently score better in the ranking than their private counterparts.

In comparison with other European countries, [[Game (hunting)|\"game meat\"]] is more accessible in Slovakia due to vast resources of forest and because hunting is relatively popular.<ref name=\"EuropeNations2000\">{{cite book|author1=United Nations.

[[Sheep|Lamb]] and [[goat]] are eaten but are not widely popular.\n\nThe traditional Slovak meals are [[bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky]], [[bryndzov\u00e9 pirohy]] and other meals with potato dough and [[bryndza]]. Bryndza is a salty cheese made of a sheep milk, characterised by a strong taste and aroma. Bryndzov\u00e9 halu\u0161ky must be on the menu of every traditional Slovak restaurant.\n\nA typical soup is a [[sauerkraut]] soup (\"kapustnica\"). A [[Black pudding|blood sausage]] called \"krvavnica\", made from any and all parts of a butchered pig is also a specific Slovak meal.\n\nWine is enjoyed throughout Slovakia. [[Slovak wine]] comes predominantly from the southern areas along the Danube and its tributaries; the northern half of the country is too cold and mountainous to grow grapevines. Traditionally, white wine was more popular than red or ros\u00e9 (except in some regions), and [[Sweetness of wine|sweet wine]] more popular than dry, but in recent years tastes seem to be changing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slovakiasite.com/slovak-cuisine.php |title=Slovak Cuisine |publisher=Slovakiasite.com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Beer (mainly of the [[pilsener]] style, though [[Dunkel|dark lagers]] are also consumed) is also popular.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Main|Sport in Slovakia}}\nSporting activities are practised widely in Slovakia, many of them on a professional level. [[Ice hockey]] and [[association football|football]] have traditionally been regarded as the most popular sports in Slovakia, though [[tennis]], [[Team handball|handball]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[whitewater slalom]], [[cycling]] and [[athletics (sport)|athletics]] are also popular.\n\n;Ice Hockey\n[[File:Slovakia2010WinterOlympicscelebration2.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Slovakia men's national ice hockey team|Slovak national ice hockey team]] celebrating a victory against [[Swedish national men's ice hockey team|Sweden]] at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]]]]\nOne of the most popular team sports in Slovakia is [[ice hockey]]. Slovakia became a member of the [[IIHF]] on 2 February 1993<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/sk/iihf-home/countries/slovakia.html |title=Slovakia |publisher=Iihf.com |date=2 February 1993 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> and since then has won 4 medals in [[Ice Hockey World Championships]], consisting of 1 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze. The most recent success was a silver medal at the [[2012 IIHF World Championship]] in [[Helsinki]]. The Slovak national hockey team made five appearances in the Olympic games, finishing 4th in the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]]. The country has 8280 registered players and is ranked 7th in the [[IIHF World Ranking]] at present. Prior to 2012, the Slovak team [[HC Slovan Bratislava]] participated in the [[Kontinental Hockey League]], considered the strongest hockey league in Europe, and the second-best in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |title=World of difference for KHL? |publisher=iihf.com |date=7 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123082543/http://www.iihf.com/fi/home-of-hockey/news/news-singleview/recap/6876.html |archivedate=23 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nSlovakia hosted the [[2011 IIHF World Championship]], where [[Finland men's national ice hockey team|Finland]] won the gold medal. Competitions took place in [[Bratislava]] and [[Ko\u0161ice]].\n\n;Football\n[[File:NFS Tehelne pole.jpg|thumb|left|[[National football stadium (Slovak)|National football stadium]] in Bratislava.]]\nAssociation football is the most popular sport in Slovakia, with over 400,000 registered players. Since 1993, the [[Slovak national football team]] has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] once, in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]. They progressed to the last 16, where they were defeated by the  [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]. The most notable result was the 3\u20132 victory over [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. In 2016, the [[Slovak national football team]] qualified for the [[UEFA Euro 2016]] tournament, under head coach [[J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k (footballer, born 1954)|J\u00e1n Koz\u00e1k]]. This helped the team reach their best ever position of 14th in the [[FIFA World Rankings]].\n\nIn club competitions, only three teams have qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] Group Stage, namely [[MFK Ko\u0161ice]] in [[1997\u201398 UEFA Champions League|1997\u201398]], [[FC Artmedia Bratislava]] in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Champions League|2005\u201306 season]], and [[M\u0160K \u017dilina]] in [[2010\u201311 UEFA Champions League|2010\u201311]]. FC Artmedia Bratislava has been the most successful team, finishing 3rd at the Group Stage of the [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], therefore qualifying for the knockout stage. They remain the only Slovak club that has won a match at the group stage.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal |Slovakia}}\n* [[Outline of Slovakia]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Julius Bartl et al., ''Slovak History: Chronology & Lexicon.''

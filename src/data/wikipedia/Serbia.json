It was said in 822 that the Serbs inhabited the greater part of Roman Dalmatia, their territory spanning what is today southwestern Serbia and parts of neighbouring countries. Meanwhile, the Byzantine Empire and Bulgarian Empire held other parts of the territory. Christianity was adopted by the Serbian rulers in ca. 870, and by the mid-10th-century the Serbian state stretched the [[Adriatic Sea]] by the [[Neretva]], the [[Sava]], the [[Pomoravlje (region)|Morava]], and [[Lake Skadar|Skadar]]. Between 1166 and 1371 Serbia was ruled by the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]] (whose legacy is especially cherished), under whom the state was elevated to [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|a kingdom]] (and briefly [[Serbian Empire|an empire]]) and Serbian bishopric to [[Serbian Orthodox Church|an autocephalous archbishopric]] (through the effort of [[Saint Sava|Sava]], the country's patron saint). Monuments of the Nemanji\u0107 period survive in many [[Serbian Orthodox monasteries|monasteries]] (several being [[List of World Heritage Sites in Serbia|World Heritage sites]]) and [[Forts in Serbia|fortifications]]. During these centuries the Serbian state (and influence) expanded significantly. The northern part, [[Vojvodina]], was ruled by the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The period known as the [[Fall of the Serbian Empire]] saw the once-powerful state fragmented into duchies, culminating in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389) against the rising [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Serbian Despotate]] was finally conquered by the Ottomans in 1459. The Ottoman threat and eventual conquest saw large migrations of Serbs to the west and north.{{sfn|\u0106orovi\u0107|2001|loc=ch.

Under the Ottoman system, Serbs, as Christians, were considered an [[rayah|inferior class]] of people and subjected to heavy taxes, and a small portion of the Serbian populace experienced [[Islamisation]]. The Ottomans abolished the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]] (1463), but reestablished it in 1557, providing for limited continuation of Serbian cultural traditions within the empire.<ref>S.Aksin Somel, ''Historical Dictionary of the Ottoman Empire,'' Scarecrow Press, Oxford, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8108-4332-3}} p 268</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Somel|first1=Selcuk Aksin|title=The A to Z of the Ottoman Empire|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1461731764|page=268|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UU8iCY0OZmcC&dq=1459+serbian+patriarchate+ottoman}}</ref>\n\nAs the [[Great Serb Migrations]] depopulated most of southern Serbia, the Serbs sought refuge across the Danube River in [[Vojvodina]] to the north and the [[Military Frontier]] in the west, where they were granted rights by the Austrian crown under measures such as the ''Statuta Wallachorum'' of 1630.

These overlapping influences have resulted in cultural varieties throughout Serbia; its north leans to the profile of Central Europe, while the south is characteristic of the wider Balkans and even the Mediterranean. The Byzantine influence on Serbia was profound, firstly through the introduction of [[Eastern Christianity]] (Orthodoxy) in the Early Middle Ages. The Serbian Orthodox Church has had an enduring status in Serbia, with the [[List of Serb Orthodox monasteries|many Serbian monasteries]] constituting the most valuable cultural monuments left from [[Serbia in the Middle Ages]].

At the beginning, they were under the influence of [[Byzantine Art]] which was particularly felt after the fall of Constantinople in 1204, when many Byzantine artists fled to Serbia.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The most noted of these monasteries is [[Studenica monastery|Studenica]] (built around 1190). It was a model for later monasteries, like the [[Mile\u0161eva]], [[Sopo\u0107ani]], [[\u017di\u010da]], [[Gra\u010danica monastery|Gra\u010danica]] and [[Visoki De\u010dani]]. In the end of 14th and the 15th centuries, autochotonous architectural style known as [[Morava architectural school|Morava style]] evolved in area around Morava Valley. A characteristic of this style was the wealthy decoration of the frontal church walls. Examples of this include [[Manasija]], [[Ravanica]] and [[Kaleni\u0107 Monastery|Kaleni\u0107]] monasteries. \n\nIcons and fresco paintings are often considered the peak of Serbian art. The most famous frescos are [[White Angel]] (Mile\u0161eva monastery), ''Crucifixion'' (Studenica monastery) and ''Dormition of the Virgin'' (Sopo\u0107ani).\n\nCountry is dotted with many well-preserved medieval fortifications and castles such as [[Smederevo Fortress]] (largest lowland fortress in Europe), [[Golubac Fortress|Golubac]], [[Magli\u010d]], [[Soko Grad (Sokobanja)|Soko grad]], [[Ostrvica Fortress|Ostrvica]] and [[Ram Fortress|Ram]].\n\nDuring the time of Ottoman occupation, Serbian art was virtually non-existent, with the exception of several Serbian artists who lived in the lands ruled by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Traditional Serbian art showed some [[Baroque]] influences at the end of the 18th century as shown in the works of [[Nikola Ne\u0161kovi\u0107]], [[Teodor Kra\u010dun]], [[Zaharije Orfelin]] and Jakov Orfelin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rastko.rs/isk/dmedakovic-art_xviii-xix.html |title=Art in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries |publisher=rastko.rs |accessdate=21 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nSerbian painting showed the influence of [[Biedermeier]], [[Neoclassicism]] and Romanticism during the 19th century.

In 1772, the [[Maharaja]] of Koch Bihar appealed to the British [[East India Company]] which assisted by ousting the Bhutanese and later in attacking Bhutan itself in 1774. A peace treaty was signed in which Bhutan agreed to retreat to its pre-1730 borders. However, the peace was tenuous, and border skirmishes with the [[British India|British]] were to continue for the next hundred years. The skirmishes eventually led to the [[Duar War]] (1864\u201365), a confrontation for control of the [[Bengal]] [[Duars]]. After Bhutan lost the war, the [[Treaty of Sinchula]] was signed between [[British India]] and Bhutan. As part of the [[war reparations]], the Duars were ceded to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in exchange for a rent of Rs. 50,000. The treaty ended all hostilities between British India and Bhutan.\n\nDuring the 1870s, power struggles between the rival valleys of [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]] and [[Tongsa]] led to civil war in Bhutan, eventually leading to the ascendancy of [[Ugyen Wangchuck]], the ''poenlop'' (governor) of Tongsa. From his power base in central Bhutan, Ugyen Wangchuck defeated his political enemies and united the country following several civil wars and rebellions during 1882\u201385.<ref name=CS2>{{Country study|country=Bhutan|abbr=bt|editor=Savada, Andrea Matles|year=1991|section=British Intrusion, 1772\u20131907|author=Worden, Robert L|pd=yes}}</ref>\n\nIn 1907, an epochal year for the country, Ugyen Wangchuck was unanimously chosen as the hereditary king of the country by the Lhengye Tshog of leading Buddhist monks, government officials, and heads of important families, with the firm petition made by Gongzim Ugyen Dorji.

This had little real effect, given Bhutan's historical reticence, and also did not appear to affect Bhutan's traditional relations with Tibet. After the new [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] gained [[Independence of India|independence]] from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, Bhutan became one of the first countries to recognize India's independence. On 8 August 1949, a treaty similar to that of 1910, in which Britain had gained power over Bhutan's foreign relations, was signed with the newly independent India.<ref name=WIAS/>\n\nIn 1953, King [[Jigme Dorji Wangchuck]] established the country's legislature \u2013 a 130-member [[National Assembly]] \u2013 to promote a more democratic form of governance.

It lies between latitudes [[26th parallel north|26\u00b0N]] and [[29th parallel north|29\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[88th meridian east|88\u00b0E]] and [[93rd meridian east|93\u00b0E]]. The land consists mostly of steep and high [[mountains of Bhutan|mountains]] crisscrossed by a network of swift rivers, which form deep valleys before draining into the Indian plains. Elevation rises from {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the southern foothills to more than {{convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. This great geographical diversity combined with equally diverse climate conditions contributes to Bhutan's outstanding range of biodiversity and ecosystems.<ref name=official/>\n\nThe northern region of Bhutan consists of an arc of [[Eastern Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows]] reaching up to glaciated mountain peaks with an extremely cold climate at the highest elevations. Most peaks in the north are over {{convert|7000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level; the highest point in Bhutan is [[Gangkhar Puensum]] at {{convert|7570|m|ft}}, which has the distinction of being the [[highest unclimbed mountain]] in the world.<ref name=CIA>{{cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bt.html |title = Bhutan \u2013 The World Factbook |publisher = [[Central Intelligence Agency]] }}</ref> The lowest point, at {{convert|98|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is in the valley of [[Drangme Chhu]], where the river crosses the border with India.<ref name=CIA/> Watered by snow-fed rivers, alpine valleys in this region provide pasture for livestock, tended by a sparse population of migratory shepherds.\n\nThe [[Black Mountains (Bhutan)|Black Mountains]] in the central region of Bhutan form a watershed between two major river systems: the [[Mo Chhu]] and the Drangme Chhu. Peaks in the Black Mountains range between {{convert|1500|and|4925|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, and fast-flowing rivers have carved out deep gorges in the lower mountain areas. The forests of the central Bhutan mountains consist of [[Eastern Himalayan subalpine conifer forests]] in higher elevations and [[Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests]] in lower elevations. Woodlands of the central region provide most of Bhutan's forest production. The [[Torsa River|Torsa]], [[Raidak]], [[Sankosh]], and [[Manas River|Manas]] are the main rivers of Bhutan, flowing through this region. Most of the population lives in the central highlands.\n\nIn the south, the [[Shiwalik Hills]] are covered with dense [[Himalayan subtropical broadleaf forests]], alluvial lowland river valleys, and mountains up to around {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The foothills descend into the subtropical [[Duars]] Plain. Most of the Duars is located in India, although a {{convert|10|to|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide strip extends into Bhutan. The Bhutan Duars is divided into two parts: the northern and the southern Duars.\n\nThe northern Duars, which abut the Himalayan foothills, have rugged, sloping terrain and dry, porous soil with dense vegetation and abundant wildlife. The southern Duars has moderately fertile soil, heavy [[savanna]]h grass, dense, mixed jungle, and freshwater springs. Mountain rivers, fed by either the melting snow or the monsoon rains, empty into the [[Brahmaputra River]] in India. Data released by the Ministry of Agriculture showed that the country had a forest cover of 64% as of October 2005.\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Landscape of Bhutan\">\nFile:082 - Gangkar Puensum - 7,570m (Dochula pass) (4677022812).jpg|[[Gangkar Puensum]], the highest mountain in Bhutan\n File:Himalayan Landscape.jpg|Sub-alpine Himalayan landscape\n File:Himalayan peak from Bumthang.jpg|A Himalayan peak from [[Bumthang (town)|Bumthang]]\n File:Jigme Dorji National Park, Bhutan.JPG|[[Jigme Dorji National Park]]\n File:HaaValley.jpg|The [[Haa District|Haa Valley]] in Western Bhutan\n</gallery>\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{See also|Thimphu#Geography and climate}}\nThe climate in Bhutan varies with elevation, from subtropical in the south to [[temperate climate|temperate]] in the highlands and [[polar climate|polar-type]] climate, with year-round snow in the north.

Women wear an ankle-length dress, the ''[[kira (dress)|kira]]'', which is clipped at the shoulders with two identical brooches called the ''koma'' and tied at the waist with kera. An accompaniment to the kira is a long-sleeved blouse, the ''wonju'' which is worn underneath the kira. A long-sleeved jacket-like garment, the ''toego'' is worn over the kira. The sleeves of the wonju and the tego are folded together at the cuffs, inside out.\n\nSocial status and class determine the texture, colours, and decorations that embellish the garments. Differently coloured scarves, known as ''rachu'' for women (red is the most common colour) and ''kabney'' for men, are important indicators of social standing, as Bhutan has traditionally been a [[feudal]] society. Jewellery is mostly worn by women, especially during religious festivals ([[tsechu]]s) and public gatherings.

The local diet also includes pork, beef, [[yak]] meat, chicken, and lamb. Soups and stews of meat and dried vegetables spiced with chilies and cheese are prepared. ''[[Ema datshi]]'', made very spicy with cheese and chilies, might be called the national dish for its ubiquity and the pride that Bhutanese have for it. Dairy foods, particularly butter and cheese from yaks and cows, are also popular, and indeed almost all milk is turned into butter and cheese. Popular beverages include [[butter tea]], black tea, locally brewed ''[[ara (drink)|ara]]'' ([[rice wine]]), and beer. Bhutan is the first country in the world to have banned the sale of [[tobacco]] under its [[Tobacco Control Act of Bhutan 2010|Tobacco Act of 2010]].<ref name=LP/>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sports in Bhutan}}\n[[File:Bhutan archery.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Changlimithang Stadium]] during a parade.]]\n\nBhutan's national and most popular sport is [[archery]].<ref name=\"impress BHUTAN\">{{cite web|url=http://www.impressbhutan.com/sports.html |title=Bhutan at Play |publisher=Impress BHUTAN Travel |accessdate=21 November 2015}}</ref> Competitions are held regularly in most villages. It differs from [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] standards in technical details such as the placement of the targets and atmosphere. Two targets are placed over 100 meters apart, and teams shoot from one end of the field to the other. Each member of the team shoots two arrows per round. Traditional Bhutanese archery is a social event, and competitions are organized between villages, towns, and amateur teams. There is usually plenty of food and drink complete with singing and dancing. Attempts to distract an opponent include standing around the target and making fun of the shooter's ability. [[Darts]] (''khuru'') is an equally popular outdoor team sport, in which heavy wooden darts pointed with a 10&nbsp;cm nail are thrown at a paperback-sized target 10 to 20 meters away.\n\nAnother traditional sport is the ''[[Digor (sports)|Digor]]'', which resembles the [[shot put]] and [[Horseshoes|horseshoe throwing]].\n\nAnother popular sport is [[basketball]].<ref name=\"impress BHUTAN\"/> In 2002, Bhutan's [[Bhutan national football team|national football team]] played [[Montserrat national football team|Montserrat]], in what was billed as [[The Other Final]]; the match took place on the same day Brazil played Germany in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Final|World Cup final]], but at the time Bhutan and Montserrat were the world's two lowest ranked teams. The match was held in Thimphu's [[Changlimithang Stadium|Changlimithang National Stadium]], and Bhutan won 4\u20130. A documentary of the match was made by the Dutch filmmaker Johan Kramer.

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the Portuguese and British.\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

The following year, Britain and a number of local rulers signed a [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|maritime truce]], giving rise to the term [[Trucial States]], which came to define the status of the coastal emirates.

The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[Second World War]], when the newly-independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]].

Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven sheikhs of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office.

BP joined with [[Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles]] (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA). A number of undersea oil surveys were carried out, including one led by the famous marine explorer [[Jacques Cousteau]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cousteau|first1=Jacques|title=Calypso explores for underwater oil |url=https://www.librarything.com/work/18080895 |journal=National Geographic Magazine|date=August 1955|volume=CVIII|issue=2 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Calypso in the Arabian Gulf: Jacques Cousteau's Undersea Survey of 1954|journal=Liwa|date=June 2015|volume=7|issue=13|pages=3\u201328|url=https://www.academia.edu/13056568|accessdate=27 November 2016}}</ref> In 1958, a floating platform rig was towed from Hamburg, Germany, and positioned over the Umm Shaif pearl bed, in Abu Dhabi waters, where drilling began.

This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962.

The smallest emirate, [[Ajman]], encompasses only {{convert|259|km2|0|abbr=on}}(see figure).\n\nThe UAE coast stretches for more than {{convert|650|km|0|abbr=on}} along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf. Most of the coast consists of [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] that extend far inland. The largest [[harbor|natural harbor]] is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many [[coral reef]]s and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the [[Al Batinah Region|Al B\u0101\u0163inah]] coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]], the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an [[exclave]] of Oman separated by the UAE.\n\nSouth and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling [[dune|sand dunes]] merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia. The desert area of Abu Dhabi includes two important oases with adequate underground water for permanent settlements and cultivation. The extensive [[Liwa Oasis]] is in the south near the undefined border with Saudi Arabia. About {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} to the northeast of Liwa is the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Al-Buraimi]] oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. [[Lake Zakher]] is a [[Man-made lake|human-made lake]] near the border with Oman.\n\nPrior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Al-Hajar al-Gharbi]] Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n[[File:1501200713074 Acacia tortilis.jpg|thumb|[[Acacia]] trees growing in desert suburbs near [[Fujairah]]]]\nThe oases grow [[Phoenix dactylifera|date palms]], [[acacia]] and [[eucalyptus]] trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of [[grasses]] and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on [[Bani Yas]] Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, [[Arabian Oryx]], [[Arabian camel]] and [[leopard]]s.

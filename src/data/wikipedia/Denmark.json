The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, often referred to as the Dano-Norwegian Realm, or simply [[Denmark-Norway]]. Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the [[Swedish Empire]], ending with large [[cession]]s of territory to Sweden. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Norway was ceded to Sweden, while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and [[Iceland]]. In the 19th century there was a surge of [[19th century in Denmark|nationalist movements]], which were defeated in the 1864 [[Second Schleswig War]]. Denmark remained neutral during [[World War I]]. In April 1940, a [[German invasion of Denmark (1940)|German invasion]] saw brief [[military]] skirmishes while the [[Danish resistance movement]] was active from 1943 until the [[Occupation of Denmark#Hardship and the end of the war|German surrender]] in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced [[Kanslergade Agreement|social and labour-market reforms]] in the early 20th century that created the basis for the present [[welfare state]] [[Nordic model|model]] with a highly developed [[mixed economy]].\n\nThe [[Constitution of Denmark]] was signed on 5 June 1849, ending the [[absolute monarchy]], which had begun in 1660. It establishes a [[constitutional monarchy]] organised as a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] democracy. The [[Politics of Denmark|government]] and [[Folketing|national parliament]] are seated in [[Copenhagen]], the nation's [[capital city|capital]], [[list of cities in Denmark by population|largest city]], and main commercial centre. Denmark exercises [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] influence in the [[Danish Realm]], [[devolution|devolving]] powers to handle internal affairs. [[Home rule]] was established in the Faroe Islands\nin 1948; in [[Greenland]] home rule was established in 1979 and [[Greenlandic self-government referendum, 2008|further autonomy]] in 2009. Denmark became a member of the [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union|EU]]) in 1973, but negotiated [[Opt-outs in the European Union|certain opt-outs]]; it retains its own currency, the [[Danish krone|krone]]. It is among the founding members of [[NATO]], the [[Nordic Council]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]], and the [[United Nations]]; it is also part of the [[Schengen Area]].\n\nDenmark is considered to be one of the most economically and socially developed countries in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/22/denmark-happiest-country_n_4070761.html|title=Denmark Is Considered The Happiest Country.

It is believed that Denmark became Christian for political reasons so as not to get invaded by the rising [[Holy Roman Empire|Christian power]] in Europe, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was an important trading area for the Danes. In that case, Harald built six [[fortresses]] around Denmark called [[Viking ring fortress|Trelleborg]] and built a further [[Danevirke]]. In the early 11th century, [[Canute the Great]] won and united Denmark, England, and [[Norway]] for almost 30 years with a Scandinavian army.<ref name=\"Lund\" />\n\nThroughout the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], Denmark also included [[Sk\u00e5neland]] (the areas of Scania, [[Halland]], and [[Blekinge]] in present-day south Sweden) and Danish kings ruled [[Danish Estonia]], as well as the [[duchy|duchies]] of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]]. Most of the latter two now form the state of [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in northern Germany.\n\nIn 1397, Denmark entered into a [[personal union]] with [[Norway]] and [[Sweden\u2013Finland|Sweden]], united under Queen [[Margaret I of Denmark|Margaret I]].{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=33}} The three countries were to be treated as equals in the union.

The issue was for practical purposes resolved on 17 June 1523, as [[List of Swedish monarchs|Swedish King]] [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] conquered the city of [[Stockholm]]. The [[Protestant Reformation]] spread to Scandinavia in the 1530s, and following the [[Count's Feud]] civil war, [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Denmark converted]] to [[Lutheranism]] in 1536.

This led to a massive Danish defeat and the armies of King [[Charles X Gustav]] of Sweden conquered both [[Jutland]], [[Funen]], and much of [[Zealand]] before signing the [[Treaty of Roskilde|Peace of Roskilde]] in February 1658, which gave Sweden control of Scania, [[Blekinge]], [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], and the island of [[Bornholm]]. Charles X Gustav quickly regretted not having wrecked Denmark and in August 1658, he began a two-year-long siege of [[Copenhagen]] but failed to take the capital.{{sfn|Stone|Bain|Booth|Parnell|2008|p=35}} In the following peace settlement, Denmark managed to maintain its independence and regain control of Tr\u00f8ndelag and Bornholm.\n\nDenmark tried to regain control of Scania in the [[Scanian War]] (1675\u20131679) but it ended in failure.

Denmark prospered greatly in the last decades of the 18th century due to its [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral status]] allowing it to trade with both sides in the many contemporary wars. In the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Denmark traded with both [[First French Empire|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and joined the [[Second League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]] with [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Sweden, and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=League of Armed Neutrality|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100056830|publisher=Oxford Reference|accessdate=28 August 2015}}</ref> The British considered this a hostile act and attacked Copenhagen in [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|1801]] and [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|1807]], in one case carrying off the [[Royal Danish Navy|Danish fleet]], in the other, burning large parts of the Danish capital.

There was a considerable migration of people from the countryside to the cities, and Danish agriculture became centred on the export of dairy and meat products.\n\nDenmark maintained its neutral stance during [[World War I]]. After the defeat of Germany, the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles powers]] offered to return the region of Schleswig-Holstein to Denmark. Fearing German [[irredentism]], Denmark refused to consider the return of the area without a [[plebiscite]]; the two [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] took place on 10 February and 14 March 1920, respectively.

From the 16th century, Dutch and Flemish designers were brought to Denmark, initially to improve the country's fortifications, but increasingly to build magnificent royal castles and palaces in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style.\nDuring the 17th century, many impressive buildings were built in the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style, both in the capital and the provinces. [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] from France was slowly adopted by native Danish architects who increasingly participated in defining architectural style. A productive period of [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]] ultimately merged into the 19th-century [[National Romantic style]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |title=Danish Architecture: An Overview |accessdate=19 July 2011 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719130528/http://www.visitdenmark.com/irland/en-ie/menu/turist/inspiration/detkulturelledanmark/arkitektur/danish-architecture-an-overview.htm |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}, ''Visit Denmark''.

Danish design is typically applied to industrial design, furniture and household objects, which have won many international awards. The [[Royal Copenhagen|Royal Porcelain Factory]] is famous for the quality of its ceramics and export products worldwide. Danish design is also a well-known brand, often associated with world-famous, 20th-century designers and architects such as [[B\u00f8rge Mogensen]], [[Finn Juhl]], [[Hans Wegner]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Poul Henningsen]] and [[Verner Panton]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522002856/http://en.ddc.dk/denmarkbydesign \"Danish by Design\"], ''DDC''.

[[Saxo Grammaticus]], normally considered the first Danish writer, worked for bishop [[Absalon]] on a chronicle of [[History of Denmark|Danish history]] (''[[Gesta Danorum]]''). Very little is known of other Danish literature from the [[Middle Ages]]. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]] came [[Ludvig Holberg]] whose comedy plays are still being performed.\n\nIn the late 19th century, literature was seen as a way to influence society. Known as the [[Modern Breakthrough]], this movement was championed by [[Georg Brandes]], [[Henrik Pontoppidan]] (awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]) and [[Jens Peter Jacobsen|J.&nbsp;P. Jacobsen]]. [[Romanticism]] influenced the renowned writer and poet [[Hans Christian Andersen]], known for his stories and [[fairy tale]]s, e.g. ''[[The Ugly Duckling]]'', ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[The Snow Queen]]''. In recent history [[Johannes Vilhelm Jensen]] was also awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Karen Blixen]] is famous for her novels and short stories. Other Danish writers of importance are [[Herman Bang]], [[Gustav Wied]], [[William Heinesen]], [[Martin Andersen Nex\u00f8]], [[Piet Hein (Denmark)|Piet Hein]], [[Hans Scherfig]], [[Klaus Rifbjerg]], [[Dan Tur\u00e8ll]], [[Tove Ditlevsen]], [[Inger Christensen]] and [[Peter H\u00f8eg]].\n\nDanish philosophy has a long tradition as part of [[Western philosophy]]. Perhaps the most influential Danish philosopher was [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], the creator of [[Christian existentialism]]. Kierkegaard had a few Danish followers, including [[Harald H\u00f8ffding]], who later in his life moved on to join the movement of [[positivism]]. Among Kierkegaard's other followers include [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who was impressed with Kierkegaard's views on the individual, and [[Rollo May]], who helped create [[humanistic psychology]]. Another Danish philosopher of note is [[N. F. S.

While international co-operation and activity has almost always been essential to the Danish artistic community, influential art collectives with a firm Danish base includes [[De Tretten]] (1909\u20131912), [[Linien]] (1930s and 1940s), [[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|COBRA]] (1948\u201351), [[Fluxus]] (1960s and 1970s), [[Junge Wilde|De Unge Vilde]] (1980s) and more recently [[Superflex]] (founded in 1993). Most Danish painters of modern times have also been very active with other forms of artistic expressions, such as sculpting, ceramics, art installations, activism, film and experimental architecture. Notable Danish painters from modern times representing various [[art movements]] include [[Theodor Philipsen]] (1840\u20131920, impressionism and naturalism), [[Anna Klindt S\u00f8rensen]] (1899\u20131985, expressionism), [[Franciska Clausen]] (1899\u20131986, Neue Sachlichkeit, cubism, surrealism and others), [[Henry Heerup]] (1907\u20131993, naivism), [[Robert Jacobsen]] (1912\u20131993, abstract painting), [[Carl Henning Pedersen]] (1913\u20132007, abstract painting), [[Asger Jorn]] (1914\u20131973, Situationist, abstract painting), [[Bj\u00f8rn Wiinblad]] (1918\u20132006, art deco, orientalism), [[Per Kirkeby]] (b. 1938, neo-expressionism, abstract painting), [[Per Arnoldi]] (b. 1941, pop art), [[Michael Kvium]] (b. 1955, neo-surrealism) and Simone Aaberg K\u00e6rn (b. 1969, superrealism).\n\nDanish photography has developed from strong participation and interest in the very beginnings of the [[history of photography|art of photography]] in 1839 to the success of a considerable number of Danes in the world of photography today. Pioneers such as [[Mads Alstrup]] and [[Georg Emil Hansen]] paved the way for a rapidly growing profession during the last half of the 19th century.

It initially emerged as a [[Margraviate of Austria|margraviate]] around 976 and developed into a [[Duchy of Austria|duchy]] and later [[Archduchy of Austria|archduchy]]. In the [[16th century]], Austria started serving as the heart of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and the junior branch of the [[House of Habsburg]] \u2013 one of the most influential [[royal house]]s in history. As archduchy, it was a major component and administrative centre of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Following the Holy Roman Empire's dissolution, Austria founded [[Austrian Empire|its own empire]] in the [[19th century]], which became a [[great power]] and the leading force of the [[German Confederation]]. Subsequent to the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|establishment of a union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] was created. Austria was involved in both [[world war]]s; it started the [[World War I|first one]] under Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] and served as the birthplace of [[Adolf Hitler]], who provoked the [[World War II|second one]].\n\nAustria is a [[Parliamentarism|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]] with a [[President of Austria|President]] as head of state and a [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] as head of government. Major [[List of cities and towns in Austria|urban areas of Austria]] include [[Graz]], [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Innsbruck]]. Austria is consistently ranked as one of the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|richest countries in the world]] by per capita GDP terms. The country has developed a [[list of countries by Human Development Index|high standard of living]] and in 2018 was ranked 20th in the world for its [[Human Development Index]].

Another theory says that this name comes from the local name of the mountain whose original Slovenian name is \"Ostravica\" (sharp mountain) - because it is very steep on both sides.\nAustria was a prefecture of Bavaria created in 976.

The Celtic kingdom of [[Noricum]] was later claimed by the [[Roman Empire]] and made a province. Present-day Petronell-[[Carnuntum]] in eastern Austria was an important army camp turned capital city in what became known as the Upper Pannonia province.

The area was known as the ''[[March of Austria|marchia Orientalis]]'' and was given to [[Leopold I of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold of Babenberg]] in 976.<ref name=\"johnson 20\">Johnson 20\u201321</ref>\n\n[[File:2011-07-09 gasometer 28.JPG|thumb|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]], 28,000 to 25,000 BC. [[Naturhistorisches Museum|Museum of Natural History Vienna]]]]\n\nThe first record showing the name Austria is from 996, where it is written as ''[[Ostarr\u00eechi]]'', referring to the territory of the Babenberg March.<ref name=\"johnson 20\" /> In 1156, the [[Privilegium Minus]] elevated Austria to the status of a duchy. In 1192, the Babenbergs also acquired the Duchy of [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]]. With the death of [[Frederick II of Austria|Frederick II]] in 1246, the line of the Babenbergs was extinguished.<ref name=\"johnson 21\">Johnson 21</ref>\n\nAs a result, [[Ottokar II of Bohemia]] effectively assumed control of the duchies of Austria, Styria, and [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]].<ref name=\"johnson 21\" /> His reign came to an end with his defeat at [[D\u00fcrnkrut]] at the hands of [[Rudolph I of Germany]] in 1278.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 23</ref> Thereafter, until World War I, Austria's history was largely that of its ruling dynasty, the [[Habsburgs]].\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\nIn the 14th and 15th centuries, the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburgs]] began to accumulate other provinces in the vicinity of the Duchy of Austria. In 1438, Duke [[Albert V of Austria]] was chosen as the successor to his father-in-law, [[Emperor Sigismund]]. Although Albert himself only reigned for a year, henceforth every emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was a Habsburg, with only one exception.\n\nThe Habsburgs began also to accumulate territory far from the hereditary lands. In 1477, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Maximilian]], only son of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]], married the heiress Maria of [[County of Burgundy|Burgundy]], thus acquiring most of the [[Netherlands]] for the family.<ref name=\"johnson 25\">Lonnie Johnson 25</ref><ref name=\"brook 11\">Brook-Shepherd 11</ref> In 1496, his son [[Philip I of Castile|Philip the Fair]] married [[Joanna the Mad]], the heiress of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] and [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]], thus acquiring Spain and its Italian, African, and [[New World]] appendages for the Habsburgs.<ref name=\"johnson 25\" /><ref name=\"brook 11\" />\n\nIn 1526, following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]], [[Bohemia]] and the part of [[Hungary]] not occupied by the Ottomans came under Austrian rule.<ref>Lonnie Johnson 26</ref> [[Ottoman\u2013Hungarian Wars|Ottoman expansion]] into Hungary led to [[Ottoman\u2013Habsburg wars|frequent conflicts]] between the two empires, particularly evident in the [[Long War (Ottoman wars)|Long War]] of 1593 to 1606.

Charles Dickens, William Harrison Ainsworth, Albert Smith (1853).</ref> In late September 1529 Suleiman the Magnificent launched the first [[Siege of Vienna]], which unsuccessfully ended, according to Ottoman historians, with the snowfalls of an early beginning winter.\n\n=== 17th and 18th centuries ===\n[[File:Vienna Battle 1683.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Vienna]] in 1683 broke the advance of the [[Ottoman Empire]] into Europe.]]\n\nDuring the long reign of [[Emperor Leopold I|Leopold I]] (1657\u20131705) and following the successful [[Battle of Vienna|defence of Vienna]] against the Turks in 1683 (under the command of the King of Poland, [[John III Sobieski]]),<ref>Lonnie Johnson 26\u201328</ref> a [[Great Turkish War|series of campaigns]] resulted in bringing most of Hungary to Austrian control by the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699.\n\n[[Emperor Charles VI]] relinquished many of the gains the empire made in the previous years, largely due to his apprehensions at the imminent extinction of the House of Habsburg. Charles was willing to offer concrete advantages in territory and authority in exchange for recognition of the [[Pragmatic Sanction]] that made his daughter [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] his heir. With the rise of [[Prussia]], the [[German dualism|Austrian\u2013Prussian dualism]] began in Germany. Austria participated, together with Prussia and Russia, in the first and the third of the three [[Partitions of Poland]] (in 1772 and 1795).\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:CongressVienna.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Congress of Vienna]] met in 1814\u201315. The objective of the Congress was to settle the many issues arising from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n\nAustria later became engaged in a war with [[Revolutionary France]], at the beginning highly unsuccessfully, with successive defeats at the hands of Napoleon, meaning the end of the old Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Two years earlier,<ref>Lonnie Johnson 34</ref> the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] was founded. From 1792 to 1801, the Austrians had suffered 754,700 casualties.<ref>Clodfelter</ref> In 1814, Austria was part of the Allied forces that invaded France and brought to an end the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nIt emerged from the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 as one of the continent's four dominant powers and a recognised [[great power]]. The same year, the [[German Confederation]] ({{lang|de|Deutscher Bund}}) was founded under the presidency of Austria. Because of unsolved social, political, and national conflicts, the German lands were shaken by the [[1848 revolution]] aiming to create a unified Germany.<ref name=\"johnson 36\">Johnson 36</ref>\n\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|A map showing the [[German Confederation]] (1815-1836) with its 39 member states.]]\n\nThe various different possibilities for a united Germany were: a [[Kleindeutschland and Gro\u00dfdeutschland|Greater Germany]], or a [[United States of Greater Austria|Greater Austria]] or just the German Confederation without Austria at all. As Austria was not willing to relinquish its German-speaking territories to what would become the [[Unification of Germany|German Empire of 1848]], the crown of the newly formed empire was offered to the Prussian King [[Friedrich Wilhelm IV]]. In 1864, Austria and Prussia fought together against [[Denmark]] and secured the independence from Denmark of the duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]].

Austria also implements the decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]], since the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] is part of the Austrian constitution.\n\n===Since 2006===\n[[File:Wien - Bundeskanzleramt1.JPG|thumb|Federal Chancellery on Ballhausplatz.]]\nAfter general elections held in October 2006, the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Party]] (SP\u00d6) emerged as the strongest party, and the [[Austrian People's Party]] (\u00d6VP) came in second, having lost about 8% of its previous polling.<ref name=\"Election2002\">{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2002|title=24 November 2002 General Election Results \u2013 Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"Election2006\">{{cite web|url=http://electionresources.org/at/nationalrat.php?election=2006|title=October&nbsp;1st,&nbsp;2006 General Election Results \u2013 Austria Totals|year=2006|website=Election Resources on the Internet|accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref> Political realities prohibited any of the two major parties from forming a coalition with smaller parties. In January 2007 the People's Party and SP\u00d6 formed a grand coalition with the social democrat [[Alfred Gusenbauer]] as Chancellor. This coalition broke up in June 2008.\n\nElections in September 2008 further weakened both major parties (SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP) but together they still held 70% of the votes, with the Social Democrats holding slightly more than the other party. They formed a coalition with [[Werner Faymann]] from the Social Democrats as Chancellor. The Green Party came in third with 11% of the vote. The FP\u00d6 and the deceased [[J\u00f6rg Haider]]'s new party [[Alliance for the Future of Austria]], both on the political right, were strengthened during the election but taken together received less than 20% of the vote.\n\nIn the [[Austrian legislative election, 2013|legislative elections of 2013]], the Social Democratic Party received 27% of the vote and 52 seats; People's Party 24% and 47 seats, thus controlling together the majority of the seats. The Freedom Party received 40 seats and 21% of the votes, while the Greens received 12% and 24 seats. Two new parties, Stronach and the NEOS, received less than 10% of the vote, and 11 and nine seats respectively.\n\nAfter the Grand Coalition broke in Spring 2017 a snap election was proclaimed for [[Austrian legislative election, 2017|October 2017]]. The Austrian People's Party (\u00d6VP) with its new young leader Sebastian Kurz emerged as the largest party in the National Council, winning 31.5% of votes and 62 of the 183 seats. The Social Democratic Party (SP\u00d6) finished second with 52 seats and 26.9% votes, slightly ahead of the Freedom Party of Austria (FP\u00d6), which received 51 seats and 26%. NEOS finished fourth with 10 seats (5.3 percent of votes), and PILZ (which split from the Green Party at the start of the campaign) entered parliament for the first time and came in fifth place with 8 seats and 4.4% The Green Party failed with 3.8% to cross the 4% threshold and was ejected from parliament, losing all of its 24 seats. The \u00d6VP has decided to form a coalation with the FP\u00d6, the new government between the center-right wing and the right-wing populist party under the new chancellor Sebastian Kurz was sworn in on 18 December 2017.\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Austria}}\n\n[[File:Inauguration EYE2014 Parlement europ\u00e9en Strasbourg 9 mai 2014.jpg|thumb|The [[European Parliament]]: Austria is one of the 28 EU members.]]\n\nThe 1955 [[Austrian State Treaty]] ended the occupation of Austria following World War II and recognised Austria as an independent and sovereign state. On 26 October 1955, the [[Federal Assembly of Austria|Federal Assembly]] passed a constitutional article in which \"Austria declares of her own free will her perpetual neutrality\". The second section of this law stated that \"in all future times Austria will not join any military alliances and will not permit the establishment of any foreign military bases on her territory\". Since then, Austria has shaped its foreign policy on the basis of neutrality, but rather different from the neutrality of Switzerland.\n\nAustria began to reassess its definition of neutrality following the fall of the [[Soviet Union]], granting overflight rights for the UN-sanctioned action against [[Iraq]] in 1991, and since 1995, it has developed participation in the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. Also in 1995, it joined [[NATO]]'s [[Partnership for Peace]] and subsequently participated in peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. Meanwhile, the only part of the Constitutional Law on Neutrality of 1955 still fully valid is not to allow foreign military bases in Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nAustria attaches great importance to participation in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and other international economic organisations, and it has played an active role in the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE). As an OSCE-participating State, Austria's international commitments are subject to monitoring under the mandate of the [[U.S. Helsinki Commission]].\n\n===Military===\n{{Main|Austrian Armed Forces}}\n\nThe manpower of the Austrian Armed Forces ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesheer}}) mainly relies on [[conscription]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} All males who have reached the age of eighteen and are found fit have to serve a six months compulsory [[military service]], followed by an eight-year reserve obligation. Both males and females at the age of sixteen are eligible for voluntary service.<ref name=\"CIA\" /> [[Conscientious objector|Conscientious objection]] is legally acceptable and those who claim this right are obliged to serve an institutionalised nine months [[Zivildienst in Austria|civilian service]] instead. Since 1998, women volunteers have been allowed to become professional soldiers.\n\nThe main sectors of the Bundesheer are Joint Forces (Streitkr\u00e4ftef\u00fchrungskommando, SKF\u00fcKdo) which consist of Land Forces (Landstreitkr\u00e4fte), Air Forces (Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte), International Missions (Internationale Eins\u00e4tze) and Special Forces (Spezialeinsatzkr\u00e4fte), next to Joint Mission Support Command (Kommando Einsatzunterst\u00fctzung; KdoEU) and Joint Command Support Centre (F\u00fchrungsunterst\u00fctzungszentrum; F\u00fcUZ). Austria is a [[landlocked country]] and has no navy.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em; border:1px #ddd solid;\"\n|+ '''Branches of the Austrian Armed Forces'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Leopard 2A4 Austria 4.JPG|border|x120px]]<br><small>[[Austrian Army]]<br>[[Leopard 2]] [[main battle tank]]</small>\n| style=\"width:120px;\"|[[File:Eurofighter Typhoon AUT.jpg|border|x120px]]<br><small>[[Austrian Air Force]]<br>[[Eurofighter Typhoon]] [[fighter aircraft]]</small>\n|}\n\nIn 2012, Austria's defence expenditures corresponded to approximately 0.8% of its GDP. The Army currently has about 26,000<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/info-hub/defence-data-portal/Austria/year/2012|title=Defence Data|website=europa.eu}}</ref> soldiers, of whom about 12,000 are conscripts. As head of state, [[President of Austria|Austrian President]] is nominally the Commander-in-Chief of the Bundesheer. Command of the Austrian Armed Forces is exercised by the Minister of Defence, {{as of|2018|March|lc=yes}}: [[Mario Kunasek]].\n\nSince the end of the [[Cold War]], and more importantly the removal of the former heavily guarded \"[[Iron Curtain]]\" separating Austria and its [[Eastern Bloc]] neighbours ([[Hungary]] and former [[Czechoslovakia]]), the Austrian military has been assisting Austrian border guards in trying to prevent border crossings by [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]]. This assistance came to an end when Hungary and [[Slovakia]] joined the EU [[Schengen Area]] in 2008, for all intents and purposes abolishing \"internal\" border controls between treaty states. Some politicians have called for a prolongation of this mission, but the legality of this is heavily disputed. In accordance with the Austrian constitution, armed forces may only be deployed in a limited number of cases, mainly to defend the country and aid in cases of national emergency, such as in the wake of [[natural disaster]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria 1920 (reinst. 1945, rev. 2013)|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Austria_2013?lang=en|website=Constitute|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> They may generally not be used as auxiliary police forces.\n\nWithin its [[Declaration of Neutrality|self-declared status of permanent neutrality]], Austria has a long and proud tradition of engaging in UN-led peacekeeping and other humanitarian missions. The [[Austrian Forces Disaster Relief Unit]] (AFDRU), in particular, an all-volunteer unit with close ties to civilian specialists (e.g. rescue dog handlers) enjoys a reputation as a quick (standard deployment time is 10 hours) and efficient [[Search and rescue|SAR]] unit. Currently, larger contingents of Austrian forces are deployed in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]].\n\n===Administrative divisions=== <!---\"Administrative divisions of Austria\" redirects here--->\n{{main|States of Austria}}\nAs a [[federal republic]], Austria is divided into [[States of Austria|nine states]] ({{lang-de|link=no|Bundesl\u00e4nder}}).<ref name=\"CIA\" /> These states are then divided into [[Districts of Austria|districts]] ({{lang|de|[[Bezirke]]}}) and statutory cities ({{lang|de|[[Statutarstadt|Statutarst\u00e4dte]]}}). Districts are subdivided into municipalities ({{lang|de|Gemeinden}}). Statutory Cities have the competencies otherwise granted to both districts and municipalities. The states are not mere administrative divisions but have some legislative authority distinct from the federal government, e.g. in matters of culture, social care, youth and nature protection, hunting, building, and zoning ordinances. In recent years, it has been discussed whether today it is appropriate for a small country to maintain ten parliaments.\n\n{{Austrian Federal States|options=float:left; font-size:100%; border:3px; max-width:480px; width:50%}}\n{| style=\"background:none\" cellspacing=\"2\"\n|\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; font-size:100%\"\n|- style=\"font-size:100%; text-align:right\"\n!style=\"width:25%\"| [[States of Austria|State]] !!style=\"width:25%;\"| Capital\n!style=\"width:25%\"| Area<br />{{smaller|([[Square kilometre|sq km]])}} !!style=\"width:25%;\"| Population<br />{{smaller|(1 January. 2017)}}\n!style=\"width:25%;\"| Density km2\n!style=\"width:25%;\"| GDP (euro)<br />{{smaller|(2012 Eurostat)}} !!style=\"width:25%;\"| GDP per capita\n|-\n| [[Burgenland]] || [[Eisenstadt]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 3,965 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 291,942 || 73.6 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 7.311 bn || 25,600\n|-\n| [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] || [[Klagenfurt]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 9,536 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 561,077 || 58.8 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 17.62 bn || 31,700\n|-\n| [[Lower Austria]] || [[Sankt P\u00f6lten]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 19,178 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 1,665,753 || 86.9 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 49.75 bn || 30,800\n|-\n| [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] || [[Salzburg]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 7,154 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 549,263 || 76.8 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 23.585 bn || 44,500\n|-\n| [[Styria]] || [[Graz]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 16,401 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 1,237,298 || 75.4 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 40.696 bn || 33,600\n|-\n| [[Tirol (state)|Tyrol]] || [[Innsbruck]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 12,648 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"| 746,153 || 59.0 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 28.052 bn || 39,400\n|-\n| [[Upper Austria]] || [[Linz]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 11,982 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,465,045 || 122.3 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 53.863 bn || 38,000\n|-\n|colspan=2| [[Vienna]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 415 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"| 1,867,582 || 4.500 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 81.772 bn || 47,300\n|-\n| [[Vorarlberg]] || [[Bregenz]]\n|style=\"text-align:right\"| 2,601 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"| 388,752 || 149.5 ||style=\"text-align:right\"| 14.463 bn || 38,900\n|-\n|colspan=7 |<ref>{{cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122431/http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/submitViewTableAction.do |archivedate=6 October 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.at/wcm/idc/idcplg?IdcService=GET_FILE&dID=354032&dDocName=080904|title=Statistik Austria - Bev\u00f6lkerung zu Jahresbeginn 2002-2017 nach Gemeinden (Gebietsstand 1.1.2017)|publisher=}}</ref>\n|}\n|}\n\n=== Corrections system ===\n {{Disputed section|date=May 2018}}\nThe Ministry in charge of the Austrian corrections system is the Ministry of Justice.<ref name=\"prisonstudies.org\">\u201cAustria.\u201d Austria | World Prison Brief, 1 Jan. 1970, http://www.prisonstudies.org/country/austria.</ref> The Ministry of Justice is based out of the UK and is supported through multiple European countries.<ref name=\"prisonstudies.org\"/> The head of the prison administration falls under the title of Director General.<ref name=\"prisonstudies.org\"/> The current Director General is Christian Schnattler.

Of the total area of Austria ({{convert|84000|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}), only about a quarter can be considered low lying, and only 32% of the country is below {{convert|500|m|ft|0}}. The Alps of western Austria give way somewhat into low lands and plains in the eastern part of the country.\n\nAustria lies between latitudes [[46th parallel north|46\u00b0]] and [[49th parallel north|49\u00b0 N]], and longitudes [[9th meridian east|9\u00b0]] and [[18th meridian east|18\u00b0 E]].\n\nIt can be divided into five areas, the biggest being the [[Eastern Alps]], which constitute 62% of the nation's total area. The Austrian foothills at the base of the Alps and the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] account for around 12% and the foothills in the east and areas surrounding the periphery of the Pannoni low country amount to about 12% of the total landmass. The second greater mountain area (much lower than the Alps) is situated in the north. Known as the Austrian [[granite]] [[plateau]], it is located in the central area of the Bohemian Mass and accounts for 10% of Austria. The Austrian portion of the [[Vienna basin]] comprises the remaining 4%.\n\n[[File:Oesterreich topo.png|thumb|upright=1.15|A topographic map of Austria showing cities with over 100,000 inhabitants.]]\n\nThe six highest mountains in Austria are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ddd;\"\n!\n!

The subarctic and tundra climates seen around the Alps are much warmer in winter than what is normal elsewhere due in part to the Oceanic influence on this part of Europe.<ref name=\"ZAMG\"/><ref>{{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/country/4/|title= Climate-Data.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title= Atlantic influence on the Alps|journal= Environmental Research Letters|volume= 8|issue= 3|pages= 034026|doi= 10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034026|year= 2013|last1= Zampieri|first1= Matteo|last2= Scoccimarro|first2= Enrico|last3= Gualdi|first3= Silvio}}</ref>\n<br>\n{{Weather box\n| collapsed=collapsed\n|location = Lech, Vorarlberg (1440 m; average temperatures 1982 \u2013 2012) Dfc, bordering on Dfb.\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n<!--Average high temperatures-->\n|Jan high C = -0.7\n|Feb high C = 0.3\n|Mar high C = 3.5\n|Apr high C = 7.1\n|May high C = 11.8\n|Jun high C = 17.4\n|Jul high C = 16.8\n|Aug high C = 14.3\n|Sep high C = 15.1\n|Oct high C = 9.7\n|Nov high C = 3.7\n|Dec high C = 0.1\n|Average high C =\n|Jan mean C = -4.5\n|Feb mean C = -3.7\n|Mar mean C = -0.6\n|Apr mean C = 2.9\n|May mean C = 7.3\n|Jun mean C = 10.6\n|Jul mean C = 12.7\n|Aug mean C = 12.2\n|Sep mean C = 9.9\n|Oct mean C = 5.6\n|Nov mean C = 0.4\n|Dec mean C = -3.3\n|year mean C =\n|Jan low C = -8.2\n|Feb low C = -7.6\n|Mar low C = -4.7\n|Apr low C = -1.3\n|May low C = 2.8\n|Jun low C = 6.0\n|Jul low C = 8.0\n|Aug low C = 7.7\n|Sep low C = 5.6\n|Oct low C = 1.6\n|Nov low C = -2.9\n|Dec low C = -6.6\n|Average low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 59\n|Feb precipitation mm = 54\n|Mar precipitation mm = 56\n|Apr precipitation mm = 70\n|May precipitation mm = 103\n|Jun precipitation mm = 113\n|Jul precipitation mm = 133\n|Aug precipitation mm = 136\n|Sep precipitation mm = 95\n|Oct precipitation mm = 67\n|Nov precipitation mm = 78\n|Dec precipitation mm = 66\n|year precipitation mm =\n|source 1= <ref name=ZAMG />\n|source 2= {{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/location/117363/|title= Lech climate data}}\n}}\n{{Weather box\n|collapsed=collapsed\n|location = K\u00fchtai, Tyrol(2060 m; average temperatures 1982 \u2013 2012) ET, somewhat close to Dfc.\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n<!--Average high temperatures-->\n|Jan high C = -3.3\n|Feb high C = -3.2\n|Mar high C = -0.9\n|Apr high C = 2.3\n|May high C = 7.0\n|Jun high C = 10.4\n|Jul high C = 12.7\n|Aug high C = 12.3\n|Sep high C = 9.6\n|Oct high C = 6.3\n|Nov high C = 0.5\n|Dec high C = -2.4\n|Average high C =\n|Jan mean C = -6.6\n|Feb mean C = -6.5\n|Mar mean C = -4.2\n|Apr mean C = -1.1\n|May mean C = 3.4\n|Jun mean C = 6.6\n|Jul mean C = 8.8\n|Aug mean C = 8.6\n|Sep mean C = 6.4\n|Oct mean C = 2.9\n|Nov mean C = -2.4\n|Dec mean C = -5.4\n|year mean C =\n|Jan low C = -9.9\n|Feb low C = -9.8\n|Mar low C = -7.5\n|Apr low C = -4.4\n|May low C = -0.2\n|Jun low C = 2.9\n|Jul low C = 4.9\n|Aug low C = 4.9\n|Sep low C = 3.3\n|Oct low C = -0.5\n|Nov low C = -5.2\n|Dec low C = -8.4\n|Average low C =\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 73\n|Feb precipitation mm = 66\n|Mar precipitation mm = 80\n|Apr precipitation mm = 87\n|May precipitation mm = 115\n|Jun precipitation mm = 126\n|Jul precipitation mm = 148\n|Aug precipitation mm = 138\n|Sep precipitation mm = 96\n|Oct precipitation mm = 74\n|Nov precipitation mm = 83\n|Dec precipitation mm = 72\n|year precipitation mm =\n|source 1= <ref name=ZAMG />\n|source 2= {{cite web|url= https://en.climate-data.org/location/111749/|title= K\u00fchtai climate data}}\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Austria}}\n[[File:13-08-30-wien-by-RalfR-123.jpg|thumb|Modern [[Vienna]], [[Vienna International Centre]] with the [[United Nations Office at Vienna]] and the [[DC Towers|DC Tower 1]].]]\n\nAustria consistently ranks high in terms of [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|GDP per capita]],<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&ey=2012&scsm=1&ssd=1&sort=country&ds=.&br=1&c=122&s=NGDPD%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CLP&grp=0&a=&pr.x=37&pr.y=14 |title=Austria|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=17 April 2012}}</ref> due to its highly industrialized economy, and well-developed [[social market economy]]. Until the 1980s, many of Austria's largest industry firms were nationalised; in recent years, however, [[Privatization|privatisation]] has reduced state holdings to a level comparable to other European economies.

The recently deceased governor, [[J\u00f6rg Haider]], has made this fact a matter of public argument in autumn 2005 by refusing to increase the number of bilingual topographic signs in Carinthia. A poll by the K\u00e4rntner Humaninstitut conducted in January 2006 states that 65% of Carinthians are not in favour of an increase of bilingual topographic signs, since the original requirements set by the State Treaty of 1955 have already been fulfilled according to their point of view.\n\nAnother interesting phenomenon is the so-called \"[[:de:Windischen-Theorie|Windischen-Theorie]]\" stating that the Slovenes can be split in two groups: actual Slovenes and ''Windische'' (a traditional German name for Slavs), based on differences in language between Austrian Slovenes, who were taught Slovene standard language in school and those Slovenes who spoke their local Slovene dialect but went to German schools. The term ''Windische'' was applied to the latter group as a means of distinction. This politically influenced theory, dividing Slovene Austrians into the \"loyal Windische\" and the \"national Slovenes\", was never generally accepted and fell out of use some decades ago.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Austria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Austria (2017)<ref name=\"wienerzeitung\">WZ-Recherche 2016.

School attendance is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] for nine years, i.e. usually to the age of fifteen.\n\n[[Pre-school]] education (called ''Kindergarten'' in German), free in most states, is provided for all children between the ages of three and six years and, whilst optional, is considered a normal part of a child's education due to its high takeup rate. Maximum class size is around 30, each class normally being cared for by one qualified teacher and one assistant.\n\nPrimary education, or [[Volksschule]], lasts for four years, starting at age six. The maximum class size is 30, but may be as low as 15. It is generally expected that a class will be taught by one teacher for the entire four years and the stable bond between teacher and pupil is considered important for a child's well-being. The [[The three Rs|3Rs]] (Reading, wRiting and aRithmetic) dominate lesson time, with less time allotted to project work than in the UK. Children work individually and all members of a class follow the same plan of work. There is no [[Streaming (education)|streaming]].\n\nStandard attendance times are 8&nbsp;am to 12&nbsp;pm or 1&nbsp;pm, with hourly five- or ten-minute breaks. Children are given homework daily from the first year. Historically there has been no lunch hour, with children returning home to eat. However, due to a rise in the number of mothers in work, primary schools are increasingly offering pre-lesson and afternoon care.\n\nAs in Germany, secondary education consists of two main types of schools, attendance at which is based on a pupil's ability as determined by grades from the primary school. The [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] caters for the more able children, in the final year of which the [[Matura]] examination is taken, which is a requirement for access to university. The [[Hauptschule]] prepares pupils for vocational education but also for various types of further education ([[H\u00f6here Technische Lehranstalt]] HTL = institution of higher technical education; HAK = commercial academy; HBLA = institution of higher education for economic business; etc.). Attendance at one of these further education institutes also leads to the [[Matura]]. Some schools aim to combine the education available at the Gymnasium and the Hauptschule, and are known as [[Gesamtschule#Germany|Gesamtschulen]]. In addition, a recognition of the importance of learning English has led some Gymnasiums to offer a bilingual stream, in which pupils deemed able in languages follow a modified curriculum, a portion of the lesson time being conducted in English.\n\n[[File:Wien - Universit\u00e4t (3).JPG|thumb|The [[University of Vienna]]]]\n[[File:Wien 02 Campus WU a.jpg|thumb| The campus of the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business]]]]\nAs at primary school, lessons at Gymnasium begin at 8&nbsp;am and continue with short intervals until lunchtime or early afternoon, with children returning home to a late lunch. Older pupils often attend further lessons after a break for lunch, generally eaten at school. As at primary level, all pupils follow the same plan of work. Great emphasis is placed on homework and frequent testing. Satisfactory marks in the end-of-the-year report (\"Zeugnis\") are a prerequisite for moving up (\"aufsteigen\") to the next class. Pupils who do not meet the required standard re-sit their tests at the end of the summer holidays; those whose marks are still not satisfactory are required to re-sit the year (\"sitzenbleiben\").\n\nIt is not uncommon for a pupil to re-sit more than one year of school. After completing the first two years, pupils choose between one of two strands, known as \"Gymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on arts) or \"Realgymnasium\" (slightly more emphasis on science). Whilst many schools offer both strands, some do not, and as a result, some children move schools for a second time at age 12. At age 14, pupils may choose to remain in one of these two strands, or to change to a vocational course, possibly with a further change of school.\n\nThe Austrian university system had been open to any student who passed the [[Matura]] examination until recently. A 2006 bill allowed the introduction of entrance exams for studies such as Medicine. In 2001, an obligatory tuition fee (\"''Studienbeitrag''\") of \u20ac363.36 per term was introduced for all public universities. There are some non-state exceptions to this, where students can still study for a subsidized education, for example within the campus system of the [[English Teacher Training College]]. Since 2008, for all EU students the studies have been free of charge, as long as a certain time-limit is not exceeded (the expected duration of the study plus usually two terms tolerance).<ref name=\"Tuition\">{{cite web|url=http://www.help.gv.at/Content.Node/148/Seite.1480000.html#tuition|title=Studying in Austria: Tuition Fee|date=1 January 2009|website=Help.gv.at|accessdate=18 June 2009}}</ref> When the time-limit is exceeded, the fee of around \u20ac363.36 per term is charged. Some further exceptions to the fee apply, e.g. for students with a year's salary of more than about \u20ac5000. In all cases, an obligatory fee of \u20ac17 is charged for the student union and insurance.\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Austria}}\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Austria}}\n[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1756\u20131791)]]\n\nAustria's past as a European power and its cultural environment generated a broad contribution to various forms of art, most notably among them music. Austria was the birthplace of many [[Music of Austria|famous composers]] such as [[Haydn|Joseph Haydn]], [[Michael Haydn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Anton Bruckner]], [[Johann Strauss, Sr.]] and [[Johann Strauss, Jr.]] as well as members of the [[Second Viennese School]] such as [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]] and [[Alban Berg]]. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] was born in [[Salzburg]], then an independent Church Principality of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which later became part of Austria, and much of Mozart's career was spent in Vienna.\n\nVienna was for a long time an important centre of musical innovation. 18th- and 19th-century composers were drawn to the city due to the patronage of the Habsburgs, and made Vienna the European capital of classical music. During the [[Baroque period]], Slavic and Hungarian folk forms influenced Austrian music.\n\n[[File:StateOperaViennaNightBackside.jpg|thumb|left|World-famous [[Vienna State Opera]]]]\n\nVienna's status began its rise as a cultural centre in the early 16th century, and was focused around instruments, including the [[lute]]. [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent the better part of his life in Vienna. Austria's current [[national anthem]], attributed to Mozart, was chosen after [[World War II]] to replace the traditional Austrian anthem by Joseph Haydn.\n\nAustrian [[Herbert von Karajan]] was principal conductor of the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] for 35 years. He is generally regarded as one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century, and he was a dominant figure in European classical music from the 1960s until his death.<ref name=\"NYT obit\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/17/obituaries/herbert-von-karajan-is-dead-musical-perfectionist-was-81.html|title=Herbert von Karajan Is Dead; Musical Perfectionist was 81|pages=A1|work=The New York Times|first=John|last=Rockwell|date=17 July 1989}}</ref>\n\nInternational pop super star Johann H\u00f6lzel, also known by his stage name [[Falco (musician)|Falco]] was born in [[Vienna]], Austria 19 February 1957.\n\n[[Conchita Wurst]] is also a renowned singer from the Austrian stock.\n\n===Art and architecture===\n<!-- This section is linked from the redirect \"Architecture of Austria\"; if the section heading changes, please update the redirect accordingly. -->\n{{Further|List of Austrian artists and architects}}\n[[File:Wien - Schloss Belvedere, oberes (1).JPG|thumb|The [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere Palace]], an example of [[Baroque]] architecture]]\n\nAmong Austrian Artists and architects one can find the painters [[Ferdinand Georg Waldm\u00fcller]], [[Rudolf von Alt]], [[Hans Makart]], [[Gustav Klimt]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]], [[Egon Schiele]], [[Carl Moll]], and [[Friedensreich Hundertwasser]], the photographers [[Inge Morath]] and [[Ernst Haas]], and architects like [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach]], [[Otto Wagner]], [[Adolf Loos]], and [[Hans Hollein]] (recipient of the 1985 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]]).

[[Billy Wilder]], [[Fritz Lang]], [[Josef von Sternberg]], and [[Fred Zinnemann]] originally came from Austria before establishing themselves as internationally relevant movie makers. [[Willi Forst]], [[Ernst Marischka]], or [[Franz Antel]] enriched the popular cinema in German language speaking countries. [[Michael Haneke]] became internationally known for his disturbing cinematic studies, before receiving a [[Golden Globe]] for his critically acclaimed film ''[[The White Ribbon]]'' in 2010.\n\nThe first Austrian film director to receive an [[Academy Award]] was [[Stefan Ruzowitzky]]. A number of Austrian actors were able to pursue a career, the impact of which was sensed beyond national borders. Among them were [[Peter Lorre]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Curd J\u00fcrgens]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Oskar Werner]], and [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]]. [[Hedy Lamarr]] and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] became American as well as international movie stars. The latter also became the 38th Governor of California. [[Christoph Waltz]] rose to international fame with his performance in ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'', earning the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]] at [[Cannes]] in 2009, and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] in 2010 and finally two Oscars. [[Max Reinhardt]] was a master of spectacular and astute theatre productions. [[Otto Schenk]] not only excelled as a stage actor, but also as an opera director.\n\n===Science and philosophy===\n{{Further|Austrian School|Vienna circle|List of Austrian scientists}}\n[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|100px|right|[[Karl Popper]].]]\nAustria was the cradle of numerous scientists with international reputation. Among them are [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Victor Franz Hess]] and [[Christian Doppler]], prominent scientists in the 19th century. In the 20th century, contributions by [[Lise Meitner]], [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and [[Wolfgang Pauli]] to nuclear research and [[quantum mechanics]] were key to these areas' development during the 1920s and 1930s. A present-day [[quantum physics|quantum physicist]] is [[Anton Zeilinger]], noted as the first scientist to demonstrate [[quantum teleportation]].\n\nIn addition to [[physics|physicists]], Austria was the birthplace of two of the most noteworthy philosophers of the 20th century, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]]. In addition to them, biologists [[Gregor Mendel]] and [[Konrad Lorenz]] as well as mathematician [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] and engineers such as [[Ferdinand Porsche]] and [[Siegfried Marcus]] were Austrians.\n\nA focus of Austrian science has always been medicine and psychology, starting in [[Medieval Times|medieval times]] with [[Paracelsus]]. Eminent physicians like [[Theodore Billroth]], [[Clemens von Pirquet]], and [[Anton Eiselsberg|Anton von Eiselsberg]] have built upon the achievements of the 19th-century Vienna School of Medicine. Austria was home to [[Sigmund Freud]], founder of [[psychoanalysis]], [[Alfred Adler]], founder of [[Individual psychology]], psychologists [[Paul Watzlawick]] and [[Hans Asperger]], and psychiatrist [[Viktor Frankl]].\n\nThe [[Austrian School]] of Economics, which is prominent as one of the main competitive directions for economic theory, is related to Austrian economists [[Carl Menger]], [[Joseph Schumpeter]], [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]]. Other noteworthy Austrian-born \u00e9migr\u00e9s include the management thinker [[Peter Drucker]], sociologist [[Paul Felix Lazarsfeld]] and scientist [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{See also|List of Austrian writers|Austrian literature}}\n[[File:Stefan Zweig2.png|thumb|100px|[[Stefan Zweig]].]]\nComplementing its status as a land of artists and scientists, Austria has always been a country of poets, writers, and novelists. It was the home of novelists [[Arthur Schnitzler]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Thomas Bernhard]], and [[Robert Musil]], of poets [[Georg Trakl]], [[Franz Werfel]], [[Franz Grillparzer]], [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Adalbert Stifter]], [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] and children's author [[Eva Ibbotson]].\n\nFamous contemporary playwrights and novelists are [[Nobel Prize|Nobel prize]] winner [[Elfriede Jelinek]], [[Peter Handke]] and [[Daniel Kehlmann]].\n\n===Food and beverages===\n{{Main|Austrian cuisine}}\n\nAustria's cuisine is derived from that of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Austrian cuisine is mainly the tradition of Royal-Cuisine (\"Hofk\u00fcche\") delivered over centuries. It is famous for its well-balanced variations of beef and pork and countless variations of vegetables. There is also the \"Mehlspeisen\" Bakery, which created particular delicacies such as Sachertorte, \"Krapfen\" which are doughnuts usually filled with apricot jam or custard, and \"Strudel\" such as \"[[Apfelstrudel]]\" filled with apple, \"Topfenstrudel\" filled with a type of cheese curd called \"topfen\", and \"[[Millirahmstrudel]]\" (milk-cream strudel).\n\nIn addition to native regional traditions, the cuisine has been influenced by [[Hungary|Hungarian]], Bohemia [[Czech Republic|Czech]], [[Jewish]], Italian, [[Balkan]] and French cuisine, from which both dishes and methods of food preparation have often been borrowed. The Austrian cuisine is therefore one of the most multicultural and transcultural in Europe.\n\n[[File:Wiener-Schnitzel02.jpg|thumb|[[Wiener Schnitzel]]]]\n\nTypical Austrian dishes include [[Wiener Schnitzel]], Schweinsbraten, [[Kaiserschmarren]], [[Kn\u00f6del]], [[Sachertorte]] and [[Tafelspitz]]. There are also K\u00e4rntner Kasnudeln, which are pockets of dough filled with Topfen, potatoes, herbs and peppermint which are boiled and served with a butter sauce. Kasnudeln are traditionally served with a salad. [[Cantharellus|Eierschwammerl]] dishes are also popular. The sugar block dispenser [[Pez]] was invented in Austria, as well as [[Manner (confectionary)|Mannerschnitten]]. Austria is also famous for its [[Mozartkugel]]n and its coffee tradition. With over 8&nbsp;kg per year it has the sixth highest per capita coffee consumption worldwide.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-43742686|title=Coffee: Who grows, drinks and pays the most?|last=Jones|first=Lora|date=2018-04-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-05-13|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nBeer is sold in 0.2 litre (a ''Pfiff''), 0.3 litre (a ''Seidel'', ''kleines Bier'' or ''Glas Bier'') and 0.5 litre (a ''Kr\u00fcgerl'' or ''gro\u00dfes Bier'' or ''Halbe'') measures. At festivals one litre ''Ma\u00df'' and two litre ''Doppelma\u00df'' in the [[Bavaria]]n style are also dispensed. The most popular types of beer are [[lager]] (known as ''M\u00e4rzen'' in Austria), naturally cloudy ''Zwicklbier'' and [[wheat beer]]. At holidays like Christmas and Easter [[bock]] beer is also available.\n\nThe most important wine-producing areas are in [[Lower Austria]], [[Burgenland]], [[Styria]] and Vienna. The [[Gr\u00fcner Veltliner]] grape provides some of Austria's most notable white wines<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-209-gruner-veltliner |title=Gruner Veltliner Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher}}</ref> and [[Zweigelt]] is the most widely planted red wine grape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/grape-645-zweigelt |title=Zweigelt Wine |publisher=Wine-Searcher}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Upper Austria]], Lower Austria, Styria and [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], ''Most'', a type of [[cider]] or [[perry]] is widely produced.\n\n[[Schnapps]] of typically up to 60% alcohol or fruit [[brandy]] is drunk, which in Austria is made from a variety of fruits, for example [[apricot]]s and [[rowan]]berries. The produce of small private schnapps [[distillery|distilleries]], of which there are around 20,000 in Austria, is known as ''Selbstgebrannter'' or ''Hausbrand''.\n\nLocal soft drinks such as [[Almdudler]] are very popular around the country as an alternative to alcoholic beverages. Another popular drink is the so-called \"Spezi\", a mix between Coca-Cola and the original formula of [[Fanta|Orange Fanta]] or the more locally renowned [[Frucade]].{{cn|date=January 2019}} [[Red Bull]], the highest-selling energy drink in the world, was introduced by [[Dietrich Mateschitz]], an Austrian entrepreneur.\n\n===Sports===\n{{main|Sport in Austria}}\n[[File:Bergisel.jpg|thumb|[[Innsbruck]] hosted the [[1964 Winter Olympics|1964]] and [[1976 Winter Olympics]], as well as the [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics]], the first in history]]\n\nDue to the mountainous terrain, [[alpine skiing]] is a prominent sport in Austria and is extremely valuable in the promotion and economic growth of the country.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Horak|first=Roman|last2=Spitaler|first2=Georg|year=2003|title=Sport, Space and National Identity: Soccer and Skiing as Formative Forces: On the Austrian Example|url=|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|volume=46|issue=11|pages=1508\u201318|via=|doi=10.1177/0002764203046011004}}</ref> Similar sports such as [[snowboarding]] or [[ski-jumping]] are also widely popular. Austrian athletes such as [[Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll]], [[Franz Klammer]], [[Hermann Maier]], [[Toni Sailer]], [[Benjamin Raich]], [[Marlies Schild]] & [[Marcel Hirscher]] are widely regarded as some of the greatest alpine skiers of all time, [[Armin Kogler]], [[Andreas Felder]], [[Ernst Vettori]], [[Andreas Goldberger]], [[Andreas Widh\u00f6lzl]], [[Thomas Morgenstern]] & [[Gregor Schlierenzauer]] as some of the greatest ski jumpers of all time.

However, recently Austrian football has not been internationally successful. It also co-hosted the [[2008 UEFA European Football Championship]] with Switzerland. The national Austrian football league is the [[Austrian Bundesliga]], which includes teams such as record-champions [[SK Rapid Wien]], [[FK Austria Wien]], [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] and [[Sturm Graz]].\n\nBesides football, Austria also has professional national leagues for most major team sports, including the [[Austrian Hockey League]] for [[ice hockey]], and the [[\u00d6sterreichische Basketball Bundesliga]] for basketball. Horseback riding is also popular; the famed [[Spanish Riding School of Vienna]] is located in Vienna.\n\n[[Niki Lauda]] is a former [[Formula One]] driver who was three times F1 World Champion, winning in 1975, 1977 and 1984. He is currently the only driver to have been champion for both Ferrari and McLaren, the sport's two most successful constructors. Other known Austrian F1 drivers are for example [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Jochen Rindt]]. Austria also hosts F1 races ([[Austrian Grand Prix]]); now held at [[Red Bull Ring]], in the past also at [[\u00d6sterreichring]] and [[Zeltweg Airfield]].\n\n[[Thomas Muster]] is a former [[tennis]] player and one of the greatest clay courters of all time. He won the [[1995 French Open]] and in 1996 he was ranked [[List of ATP number 1 ranked players|number 1]] in the [[ATP Rankings|ATP Ranking]]. Other known Austrian tennis players are for example [[Horst Skoff]], [[J\u00fcrgen Melzer]] and [[Dominic Thiem]].\n\nSport played a significant role in developing national consciousness and boosting national self-confidence in the early years of the Second Republic after World War II, through events such as the [[Tour of Austria]] cycle race and through sporting successes such as the national football team's run to third at the 1954 World Cup and the performances of Toni Sailer and the rest of the \"Kitzb\u00fchel Miracle Team\" in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Marschick |first=Matthias |date=Summer 2011 |title=Austrian Sport and the Challenges of Its Recent Historiography |jstor=10.5406/jsporthistory.38.2.189 |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=189\u2013198 |doi=10.5406/jsporthistory.38.2.189 |doi-broken-date=2019-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Norden |first=Gilbert|date=Spring 2001 |title=Austrian Sport Museums |url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2001/JSH2801/JSH2801h.pdf |journal=Journal of Sport History |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=87\u2013107|access-date=3 January 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Austria|Tyrol|Vienna}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Austria}}\n* [[Index of Austria-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Austria]]\n{{-}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | title=The Austrians: a thousand-year odyssey | last=Brook-Shepherd | first=Gordon | publisher=Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-7867-0520-7| location=New York}}\n* {{Cite book | title=Modern Austria: empire and republic 1815\u20131986 | last=Jelavich | first=Barbara | publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=1987 | isbn=978-0-521-31625-5| location=Cambridge}}\n* {{Cite book | title=Introducing Austria: a short history | last=Johnson | first=Lonnie | publisher=Ariadne Press | year=1989 | isbn=978-0-929497-03-7| location=Riverside, Calif.}}\n* Rathkolb, Oliver.

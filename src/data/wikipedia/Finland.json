In 1809, Finland was incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]] as the autonomous [[Grand Duchy of Finland]].

But women did not get the right to run for the New Zealand legislature, until 1919.</ref>\n\nFollowing the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Finland [[Finnish Declaration of Independence|declared itself independent]]. In 1918, the fledgling state was divided by [[Finnish Civil War|civil war]], with the Bolshevik-leaning [[Finnish Socialist Workers' Republic|Red Guard]] supported by the equally new [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], fighting the [[Whites (Finland)|White Guard]], supported by the [[German Empire]]. After a brief attempt to [[Kingdom of Finland (1918)|establish a kingdom]], the country became a republic. During [[World War II]], the Soviet Union sought repeatedly to occupy Finland, with Finland losing parts of [[Karelia]], [[Salla]], [[Kuusamo]], [[Petsamo Province|Petsamo]] and some islands, but retaining their independence.\n\nFinland joined the [[United Nations]] in 1955 and established an official policy of neutrality. The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948]] gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics during the [[Cold War]] era. Finland joined the [[OECD]] in 1969, the [[Partnership for Peace|NATO Partnership for Peace]] in 1994,<ref name=\"nato.int\">[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49594.htm Relations with Finland].

After [[World War II]], the Soviet Union demanded war reparations from Finland not only in money but also in material, such as ships and machinery. This forced Finland to industrialise.

It has the inscription ''finlandi'' ([[Runestone G 319|G 319]]) and dates back to the 13th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arkisto.fi/ |title=National Archives Service, Finland (in English) |accessdate=22 January 2007}}</ref> The name can be assumed to be related to the tribe name ''Finns'', which is mentioned at first known time AD 98 (disputed meaning).\n\n=== Suomi ===\nThe name ''Suomi'' ({{Langnf|fi|2=Finnish|3=\"Finland\"}}) has uncertain origins, but a candidate for a source is the Proto-Baltic word ''*\u017aem\u0113'', meaning \"land\". In addition to the close relatives of Finnish (the [[Finnic languages]]), this name is also used in the [[Baltic languages]] [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]. Alternatively, the Indo-European word *''g\u02b0m-on'' \"man\" (cf. Gothic ''guma'', Latin ''homo'') has been suggested, being borrowed as *''\u0107oma''. The word originally referred only to the province of [[Finland Proper (historical province)|Finland Proper]], and later to the northern coast of [[Gulf of Finland]], with northern regions such as [[Ostrobothnia (historical province)|Ostrobothnia]] still sometimes being excluded until later. Earlier theories suggested derivation from ''suomaa'' ([[fen]] land) or ''suoniemi'' (fen cape), but these are now considered outdated. Some have suggested common etymology with ''saame'' ([[Sami people|Sami]], a Finno-Ugric people in [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland]]) and ''[[Tavastia (historical province)|H\u00e4me]]'' (a province in the inland), but that theory is uncertain.<ref>[http://www.kotikielenseura.fi/virittaja/hakemistot/jutut/1998_613.pdf kotikielenseura.fi], SUOMI (TTAVIA ETYMOLOGIOITA).</ref>\n\nThe first survived use of word ''Suomi'' is in 811 in the [[Royal Frankish Annals]] where it is used as a person name connected to a peace treaty.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/annalesregnifrancorum.html|title=Annesl Regni Francorum|website=www.thelatinlibrary.com|access-date=29 July 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title=''Keskiajan suomen kielen dokumentoitu sanasto ensiesiintymisvuosineen'' |last=Heikkil\u00e4 |first=Mikko K. |publisher=Mediapinta |year=2017 |isbn=978-952-236-859-1 |location= |pages=44}}</ref>\n\n=== Concept ===\nIn the earliest historical sources from the 12th and 13th centuries, the term Finland refers to the coastal region around [[Turku]] from [[Perni\u00f6]] to [[Uusikaupunki]]. This region later became known as Finland Proper in distinction from the country name Finland. Finland became a common name for the whole country in a centuries-long process that started when the [[Catholic Church]] established missionary diocese in [[Nousiainen]] in the northern part of the province of Suomi possibly sometime in the 12th century.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=Suomen museo 2003: \"The Origins of Finland and H\u00e4me\" |last=Salo |first=Unto |publisher=Suomen muinaismuistoyhdistys |year=2004 |isbn=978-951-9057-55-2 |location=Helsinki |pages=55}}</ref>\n\nThe devastation of [[Finland during the Great Northern War]] (1714\u20131721) and during the [[Russo-Swedish War (1741\u20131743)]] caused Sweden to begin carrying out major efforts to defend its eastern half from Russia.

In 1811, Alexander I incorporated Russian [[Vyborg Governorate|Vyborg province]] into the Grand Duchy of Finland. During the Russian era, the Finnish language began to gain recognition. From the 1860s onwards, a strong Finnish [[Ethnic nationalism|nationalist movement]] known as the [[Fennoman movement]] grew. Milestones included the publication of what would become Finland's [[national epic]] \u2013 the ''[[Kalevala]]'' \u2013 in 1835, and the Finnish language's achieving equal legal status with Swedish in 1892.\n[[File:Pekka Halonen - Tienraivaajia Karjalassa.jpg|thumb|''Pioneers in Karelia'' (1900) by [[Pekka Halonen]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/beta/u/0/asset/pioneers-in-karelia/tQFrkK28QHoc9w |title=Pioneers in Karelia \u2013 Pekka Halonen \u2013 Google Arts & Culture |publisher=}}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Finnish famine of 1866\u20131868]] killed 15% of the population, making it one of the worst [[famine]]s in European history.

For example, the universal suffrage was, in practice, virtually meaningless, since the tsar did not have to approve any of the laws adopted by the Finnish parliament.

Since the head of state was the [[tsar]] of Russia, it was not clear who the chief executive of Finland was after the revolution. The Parliament, controlled by social democrats, passed the so-called Power Act to give the highest authority to the Parliament.

Some social democrats refused to accept the result and still claimed that the dissolution of the parliament (and thus the ensuing elections) were extralegal. The two nearly equally powerful political blocs, the right-wing parties and the social democratic party, were highly antagonized.\n\nThe [[October Revolution]] in Russia changed the geopolitical situation anew. Suddenly, the right-wing parties in Finland started to reconsider their decision to block the transfer of highest executive power from the Russian government to Finland, as the [[Bolsheviks]] took power in Russia.

As a result of the two wars, Finland ceded most of [[Finnish Karelia]], [[Salla]], and [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], which amounted to 10% of its land area and 20% of its industrial capacity, including the ports of [[Vyborg]] (Viipuri) and the ice-free [[Liinakhamari]] (Liinahamari).

The [[Finno-Soviet Treaty of 1948|YYA Treaty]] (Finno-Soviet Pact of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance) gave the Soviet Union some leverage in Finnish domestic politics. This was extensively exploited by president [[Urho Kekkonen]] against his opponents. He maintained an effective monopoly on Soviet relations from 1956 on, which was crucial for his continued popularity. In politics, there was a tendency of avoiding any policies and statements that could be interpreted as anti-Soviet. This phenomenon was given the name \"[[Finlandization]]\" by the West German press.\n\nDespite close relations with the Soviet Union, Finland maintained a market economy. Various industries benefited from [[Bilateral trade|trade privileges]] with the Soviets, which explains the widespread support that pro-Soviet policies enjoyed among business interests in Finland. Economic growth was rapid in the postwar era, and by 1975 Finland's GDP per capita was the 15th-highest in the world. In the 1970s and 80s, Finland built one of the most extensive [[welfare state]]s in the world. Finland negotiated with the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC, a predecessor of the European Union) a treaty that mostly abolished customs duties towards the EEC starting from 1977, although Finland did not fully join. In 1981, President Urho Kekkonen's failing health forced him to retire after holding office for 25 years.\n\nFinland reacted cautiously to the collapse of the Soviet Union, but swiftly began increasing integration with the West.

[[Podzol]] profile development is seen in most forest soils except where drainage is poor. [[Gleysol]]s and peat [[bog]]s occupy poorly drained areas.\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n{{Main|Fauna of Finland|Wildlife of Finland}}\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Finland is shared between the Arctic, central European, and northern European provinces of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Finland can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Scandinavian and Russian taiga]], [[Sarmatic mixed forests]], and [[Scandinavian Montane Birch forest and grasslands]]. Taiga covers most of Finland from northern regions of southern provinces to the north of Lapland. On the southwestern coast, south of the Helsinki-[[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]] line, forests are characterized by mixed forests, that are more typical in the Baltic region. In the extreme north of Finland, near the [[tree line]] and Arctic Ocean, Montane Birch forests are common.\n\n[[File:\u00c4ht\u00e4rin karhut 7.jpg|thumb|The [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'') is Finland's national animal.]]\nSimilarly, Finland has a diverse and extensive range of fauna. There are at least sixty native [[mammal]]ian species, 248 breeding bird species, over 70 fish species, and 11 reptile and frog species present today, many migrating from neighboring countries thousands of years ago.\nLarge and widely recognized wildlife mammals found in Finland are the [[brown bear]] (the national animal), [[gray wolf]], [[wolverine]], and [[Moose|elk]]. Three of the more striking birds are the [[whooper swan]], a large European swan and the national bird of Finland; the [[Western capercaillie]], a large, black-plumaged member of the [[grouse]] family; and the [[Eurasian eagle-owl]]. The latter is considered an indicator of [[old-growth forest]] connectivity, and has been declining because of landscape fragmentation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://herkules.oulu.fi/isbn9514259904/html/x288.html |title=Nutritional and genetic adaptation of galliform birds: implications for hand-rearing and restocking |work=Oulu University Library (2000) |accessdate=23 May 2008}}</ref> The most common breeding birds are the [[willow warbler]], [[common chaffinch]], and [[redwing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.fi/lintuharrastus/faq-muut.shtml#pesimalinnut |title=BirdLife Finland |work=BirdLife International (2004) Birds in Europe: population estimates, trends and conservation status.

In the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], the whole of Finland lies in the [[subarctic climate|boreal zone]], characterized by warm summers and freezing winters. Within the country, the [[temperateness]] varies considerably between the southern coastal regions and the extreme north, showing characteristics of both a [[Oceanic climate|maritime]] and a [[continental climate]]. Finland is near enough to the Atlantic Ocean to be continuously warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]]. The Gulf Stream combines with the moderating effects of the [[Baltic Sea]] and numerous inland lakes to explain the unusually warm climate compared with other regions that share the same [[latitude]], such as [[Alaska]], [[Siberia]], and southern [[Greenland]].<ref name=\"Finland's climate\">{{cite web |title=Finland's climate |url=http://www.fmi.fi/weather/climate.html |publisher=Finnish Meteorological Institute|accessdate=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nWinters in southern Finland (when mean daily temperature remains below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|disp=or}}) are usually about 100 days long, and in the inland the snow typically covers the land from about late November to April, and on the coastal areas such as [[Helsinki]], snow often covers the land from late December to late March.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://ilmasto-opas.fi/fi/ilmastonmuutos/suomen-muuttuva-ilmasto/-/artikkeli/08848977-fd1a-4e85-8389-7ecf3ca7de7d/uusimaa-merellisen-ilmaston-maakunta.html|title = The climate in Finland (finnish)|date = |accessdate = 3 January 2015|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> Even in the south, the harshest winter nights can see the temperatures fall to {{convert|-30|\u00b0C}} although on coastal areas like Helsinki, temperatures below {{convert|-30|\u00b0C|0}} are rare.

The regions are governed by regional councils which serve as forums of cooperation for the [[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] of a region. The main tasks of the regions are regional planning and development of enterprise and education. In addition, the public health services are usually organized on the basis of regions. Currently, the only region where a popular election is held for the council is Kainuu. Other regional councils are elected by municipal councils, each municipality sending representatives in proportion to its population.\n\nIn addition to inter-municipal cooperation, which is the responsibility of regional councils, each region has a state Employment and Economic Development Centre which is responsible for the local administration of labour, agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and entrepreneurial affairs. The [[Finnish Defence Forces]] regional offices are responsible for the regional defence preparations and for the administration of conscription within the region.\n\nRegions represent dialectal, cultural, and economic variations better than the former [[Provinces of Finland|provinces]], which were purely administrative divisions of the central government. Historically, regions are divisions of [[historical provinces of Finland]], areas which represent dialects and culture more accurately.\n\nSix [[Regional State Administrative Agencies of Finland|Regional State Administrative Agencies]] were created by the state of Finland in 2010, each of them responsible for one of the regions called {{lang|fi|alue}} in Finnish and {{lang|sv|region}} in Swedish; in addition, \u00c5land was designated a seventh region. These take over some of the tasks of the earlier [[Provinces of Finland]] (''l\u00e4\u00e4ni''/''l\u00e4n''), which were abolished.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avi.fi/fi/Sivut/etusivu.aspx |title=Tervetuloa aluehallintoviraston verkkosivuille! |publisher=State Provincial Office |language=Finnish |accessdate=9 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315151138/http://www.avi.fi/fi/Sivut/etusivu.aspx |archivedate=15 March 2012 }}</ref>\n{| style=\"with:90%\"\n| style=\"width:50%\" |{{Finnish Regions|options=float:top}}\n| style=\"width:50%\" |\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

[[Municipalities of Finland|municipalities]], which may also call themselves towns or cities. They account for half of public spending. Spending is financed by municipal income tax, state subsidies, and other revenue. {{As of|2017}}, there are 311 municipalities,<ref name=\"Suomen Kuntaliitto\" /> and most have fewer than 6,000 residents.\n\nIn addition to municipalities, two intermediate levels are defined. Municipalities co-operate in seventy [[Sub-regions of Finland|sub-regions]] and nineteen [[Regions of Finland|regions]]. These are governed by the member municipalities and have only limited powers. The autonomous province of \u00c5land has a permanent democratically elected regional council. Sami people have a semi-autonomous [[Sami native region (Finland)|Sami native region]] in Lapland for issues on language and culture.\n\nIn the following chart, the number of inhabitants includes those living in the entire municipality (''kunta/kommun''), not just in the built-up area. The land area is given in km\u00b2, and the density in inhabitants per km\u00b2 (land area). The figures are as of {{#time:d F Y |{{Infobox Finnish Municipality/population count|sourcedate}}}}.

[[Constitution of Finland]] defines the political system; Finland is a [[parliamentary republic]] within the framework of a [[representative democracy]]. The [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] is the country's most powerful person. The current version of the constitution was enacted on 1 March 2000, and was amended on 1 March 2012.

Finland has had for most of its independence a [[semi-presidential system]], but in the last few decades the powers of the President have been diminished. In constitution amendments, which came into effect in 1991 or 1992 and also with a new drafted constitution of 2000, amended in 2012, the President's position has become primarily a ceremonial office. However, the President still leads the nation's foreign politics together with the Council of State and is the commander-in-chief of the Defence Forces.<ref name=\"Parliamentary\">Formerly a semi-presidential republic, it is now a parliamentary republic according to David Arter, First Chair of Politics at Aberdeen University. In his \"Scandinavian Politics Today\" (Manchester University Press, revised 2008 {{ISBN|9780719078538}}), he quotes {{Cite journal |last=Nousiainen |first=Jaakko |date=June 2001 |title=From semi-presidentialism to parliamentary government: political and constitutional developments in Finland |journal=[[Scandinavian Political Studies]] |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=95\u2013109 |doi=10.1111/1467-9477.00048 |ref=harv}} as follows: \"There are hardly any grounds for the epithet 'semi-presidential'.\" Arter's own conclusions are only slightly more nuanced: \"The adoption of a new constitution on 1 March 2000 meant that Finland was no longer a case of semi-presidential government other than in the minimalist sense of a situation where a popularly elected fixed-term president exists alongside a prime minister and cabinet who are responsible to parliament (Elgie 2004: 317)\". According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitutional amendments reduced the powers of the president even further.</ref> The position still does entail some powers, including responsibility for [[Foreign relations of Finland|foreign policy]] (excluding affairs related to the [[European Union]]) in cooperation with the [[Finnish Government|cabinet]], being [[Commander-in-Chief|the head of the armed forces]], some decree and pardoning powers, and some appointive powers. Direct, one- or two-stage elections are used to elect the president for a term of six years and for a maximum of two consecutive terms. The current president is [[Sauli Niinist\u00f6]]; he took office on 1 March 2012. Former presidents were [[Kaarlo Juho St\u00e5hlberg|K. J.

The presidency between 1946 and the present was instead held by a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] or the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]].\n\n=== Parliament ===\n{{Main|Parliament of Finland}}\n[[File:Eduskuntatalo Helsinki.jpg|thumb|The [[Parliament of Finland]]'s main building.]]\n\nThe 200-member [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Parliament of Finland]] ({{Lang-fi|Eduskunta}}, {{Lang-sv|Riksdag}}) exercises supreme legislative authority in the country. It may alter the constitution and ordinary laws, dismiss the cabinet, and override presidential vetoes. Its acts are not subject to judicial review; the constitutionality of new laws is assessed by the parliament's [[Parliament of Finland#Committees|constitutional law committee]]. The parliament is elected for a term of four years using the proportional [[D'Hondt method]] within a number of multi-seat constituencies through the [[Open list#Most open|most open list]] multi-member districts. Various parliament committees listen to experts and prepare legislation. The [[Speaker of the Parliament of Finland|speaker of the parliament]] is [[Paula Risikko]] ([[National Coalition]]).<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.eduskunta.fi/EN/tiedotteet/Pages/speaker-risikko-elected.aspx| title = Paula Risikko Elected as New Speaker of Parliament |publisher = [[Parliament of Finland|Eduskunta]]| author =| accessdate = 24 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nSince [[universal suffrage]] was introduced in 1906, the parliament has been dominated by the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]] (former Agrarian Union), the [[National Coalition Party]], and the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democrats]]. These parties have enjoyed approximately equal support, and their combined vote has totalled about 65\u201380% of all votes. Their lowest common total of MPs, 121, was reached in the 2011 elections. For a few decades after 1944, the [[Communist Party of Finland|Communists]] were a strong fourth party. Due to the electoral system of proportional representation, and the relative reluctance of voters to switch their support between parties, the relative strengths of the parties have commonly varied only slightly from one election to another. However, there have been some long-term trends, such as the rise and fall of the Communists during the Cold War; the steady decline into insignificance of the [[Liberals (Finland)|Liberals]] and its predecessors from 1906 to 1980; and the rise of the [[Green League]] since 1983. In the 2011 elections, the [[True Finns|Finns Party]] achieved exceptional success, increasing its representation from 5 to 39 seats, surpassing the Centre Party.<ref>The source for historical information on party support is [[:fi:Suomen eduskunta#Kansanedustajat puolueittain ja vaaleittain|the Finnish Wikipedia's article on the parliament]]</ref>\n\nThe autonomous province of \u00c5land, which forms a [[federacy]] with Finland, elects one member to the parliament, who traditionally joins the [[parliamentary group]] of the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]]. (The province also holds elections for its own permanent [[Parliament of \u00c5land|regional council]], and in the [[\u00c5land legislative election, 2011|2011 elections]], [[\u00c5land Centre]] was the largest party.)\n\nThe Parliament can be dissolved by a recommendation of the Prime Minister, endorsed by the President. This procedure has never been used, although the parliament was dissolved eight times under the pre-2000 constitution, when this action was the sole prerogative of the president.\n\nAfter the [[Finnish parliamentary election, 2015|parliamentary elections on 19 April 2015]], the seats were divided among eight parties as follows:<ref>{{cite web| url = http://vaalit.yle.fi/tulospalvelu/2015/eduskuntavaalit/?puolueet_##taulukko| title = Eduskuntavaalit 2015 \u2013 tulospalvelu \u2013 yle.fi| publisher = [[Yle]]| author =| accessdate = 5 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The cabinet can be dismissed by a parliamentary vote of no confidence, although this rarely happens (the last time in 1957), as the parties represented in the cabinet usually make up a majority in the parliament.<ref>[[:fi:Ep\u00e4luottamuslause|The Finnish Wikipedia's article on Motion of no confidence]]</ref>\n\nThe cabinet exercises most executive powers, and originates most of the bills that the parliament then debates and votes on. It is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Finland]], and consists of him or her, of other ministers, and of the [[Chancellor of Justice#Finland|Chancellor of Justice]]. The current prime minister is [[Juha Sipil\u00e4]] (Centre Party). Each minister heads his or her ministry, or, in some cases, has responsibility for a subset of a ministry's policy. After the prime minister, the most powerful minister is the [[Minister of Finance (Finland)|minister of finance]]. The incumbent Minister of Finance is [[Petteri Orpo]].\n\nAs no one party ever dominates the parliament, Finnish cabinets are multi-party coalitions. As a rule, the post of prime minister goes to the leader of the biggest party and that of the minister of finance to the leader of the second biggest.\n\n=== Law ===\n{{Main|Law of Finland|Judicial system of Finland}}\n[[File:Supreme Court of Finland.jpg|thumb|right|The Court House of the Supreme Court]]\nThe judicial system of Finland is a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system divided between [[court]]s with regular civil and criminal jurisdiction and [[administrative court]]s with jurisdiction over litigation between individuals and the public administration. Finnish law is codified and based on [[Judiciary of Sweden|Swedish law]] and in a wider sense, civil law or [[Roman law]]. The court system for civil and criminal jurisdiction consists of local courts (''k\u00e4r\u00e4j\u00e4oikeus'', ''tingsr\u00e4tt''), regional appellate courts (''hovioikeus'', ''hovr\u00e4tt''), and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] (''korkein oikeus'', ''h\u00f6gsta domstolen''). The administrative branch of justice consists of administrative courts (''hallinto-oikeus'', ''f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstol'') and the [[Judicial system of Finland#Supreme Administrative Court|Supreme Administrative Court]] (''korkein hallinto-oikeus'', ''h\u00f6gsta f\u00f6rvaltningsdomstolen''). In addition to the regular courts, there are a few special courts in certain branches of administration.

Since the 1980s the social security has been cut back, but still the system is one of the most comprehensive in the world. Created almost entirely during the first three decades after World War II, the social security system was an outgrowth of the traditional Nordic belief that the state was not inherently hostile to the well-being of its citizens, but could intervene benevolently on their behalf. According to some social historians, the basis of this belief was a relatively benign history that had allowed the gradual emergence of a free and independent peasantry in the Nordic countries and had curtailed the dominance of the nobility and the subsequent formation of a powerful right wing. Finland's history has been harsher than the histories of the other Nordic countries, but not harsh enough to bar the country from following their path of social development.<ref name=\"LOC\">Text from PD source: US Library of Congress: ''[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/fitoc.html A Country Study: Finland]'', Library of Congress Call Number DL1012 .A74 1990.</ref>\n\n=== Military ===\n[[File:Tracked transport vehicle Sisu NA 110.JPG|thumb|right|[[Sisu Nasu]] NA-110 tracked transport vehicle of the Finnish Army.

The standard readiness strength is 34,700 people in uniform, of which 25% are professional soldiers. A universal male [[conscription]] is in place, under which all male Finnish nationals above 18 years of age serve for 6 to 12 months of armed service or 12 months of civilian (non-armed) service.\nVoluntary post-conscription overseas peacekeeping service is popular, and troops serve around the world in UN, NATO, and EU missions. Approximately 500 women choose voluntary military service every year.<ref>[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Women's voluntary service] (in Finnish)</ref> Women are allowed to serve in all combat arms including front-line infantry and special forces.\nThe army consists of a highly mobile field army backed up by local defence units. The army defends the national territory and its military strategy employs the use of the heavily forested terrain and numerous lakes to wear down an aggressor, instead of attempting to hold the attacking army on the frontier.\n\nFinnish defence expenditure per capita is one of the highest in the European Union.<ref>[http://www.stat.fi/artikkelit/2007/art_2007-06-01_005.html Ty\u00f6voimakustannukset puuttuvat puolustusmenoista], Statistics Finland (in Finnish): Eurostat ranking is sixth, but the third when conscription is accounted.</ref> The Finnish military doctrine is based on the concept of total defence. The term total means that all sectors of the government and economy are involved in the defence planning.

The country lies between the latitudes 60\u00b0N and 70\u00b0N, and it has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frost. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60\u00b0 north latitude. Annual precipitation is usually sufficient, but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months, making summer droughts a constant threat. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and frost-resistant varieties of crops, and they have cultivated south-facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts. Most farmland was originally either forest or swamp, and the soil has usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to improve fertility. Irrigation has generally not been necessary, but drainage systems are often needed to remove excess water. Finland's agriculture has been efficient and productive\u2014at least when compared with farming in other European countries.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nForests play a key role in the country's economy, making it one of the world's leading wood producers and providing raw materials at competitive prices for the crucial wood-processing industries. As in agriculture, the government has long played a leading role in forestry, regulating tree cutting, sponsoring technical improvements, and establishing long-term plans to ensure that the country's forests continue to supply the wood-processing industries. To maintain the country's comparative advantage in forest products, Finnish authorities moved to raise lumber output toward the country's ecological limits. In 1984, the government published the Forest 2000 plan, drawn up by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The plan aimed at increasing forest harvests by about 3% per year, while conserving forestland for recreation and other uses.<ref name=\"LOC\" />\n\nPrivate sector employees amount to 1.8 million, out of which around a third with tertiary education.

Initially, most development was based on two broad groups of export-led industries, the \"metal industry\" (''metalliteollisuus'') and \"forest industry\" (''mets\u00e4teollisuus''). The \"metal industry\" includes shipbuilding, metalworking, the car industry, engineered products such as motors and electronics, and production of metals (steel, copper and chromium). The world's biggest [[cruise ship]]s are built in Finnish shipyards. The \"forest industry\" includes forestry, timber, pulp and paper, and is a logical development based on Finland's extensive forest resources (77% of the area is covered by forest, most of it in renewable use). In the [[pulp and paper industry]], many of the largest companies are based in Finland ([[Ahlstrom]], [[Mets\u00e4 Board]], and [[UPM (company)|UPM]]). However, the Finnish economy has diversified, with expansion into fields such as electronics (e.g. [[Nokia]]), metrology ([[Vaisala]]), transport fuels ([[Neste]]), chemicals ([[Kemira]]), engineering consulting ([[P\u00f6yry]]), and information technology (e.g. [[Rovio Entertainment]], known for [[Angry Birds]]), and is no longer dominated by the two sectors of metal and forest industry. Likewise, the structure has changed, with the service sector growing, with manufacturing reducing in importance; agriculture is only a minor part. Despite this, production for export is still more prominent than in Western Europe, thus making Finland more vulnerable to global economic trends.\n\nIn an [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] report released in September 2011, Finland clinched the second place after the United States on Benchmarking IT Industry Competitiveness 2011 which scored on 6 key indicators: overall business environment, technology infrastructure, human capital, legal framework, public support for industry development, and research and development landscape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/singapore-tops-it-competitiveness-in-asia-pacific-ranks-no-3-worldwide/468002 |title=Singapore Tops IT Competitiveness in Asia Pacific, Ranks No. 3 Worldwide |date=27 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220204542/http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/seasia/singapore-tops-it-competitiveness-in-asia-pacific-ranks-no-3-worldwide/468002 |archivedate=20 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\n=== Public policy ===\n{{See also|Nordic model}}\n\nFinnish politicians have often emulated other Nordics and the Nordic model.<ref name=\"nordicmodel\">[http://www.etla.fi/files/1892_the_nordic_model_complete.pdf The Nordic Model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905212132/http://www.etla.fi/files/1892_the_nordic_model_complete.pdf |date=5 September 2012 }} by Torben M.

This prompted [[Elias L\u00f6nnrot]] to collect Finnish and Karelian folk poetry and arrange and publish them as the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the Finnish [[national epic]]. The era saw a rise of poets and novelists who wrote in Finnish, notably [[Aleksis Kivi]] and [[Eino Leino]]. Many writers of the national awakening wrote in Swedish, such as the national poet [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] and [[Zachris Topelius]].\n\nAfter Finland became independent, there was a rise of [[Modernist literature|modernist writers]], most famously the Finnish-speaking [[Mika Waltari]] and Swedish-speaking [[Edith S\u00f6dergran]]. [[Frans Eemil Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1939. World War II prompted a return to more national interests in comparison to a more international line of thought, characterized by [[V\u00e4in\u00f6 Linna]]. Besides Kalevala and Waltari, the Swedish-speaking [[Tove Jansson]] is the most translated Finnish writer. <!--Pure opinion?: Literature in modern Finland is in a healthy state.--> Popular modern writers include [[Arto Paasilinna]], [[Ilkka Remes]], [[Kari Hotakainen]], [[Sofi Oksanen]], and [[Jari Tervo]], while the best novel is annually awarded the prestigious [[Finlandia Prize]].\n[[File:Sammon puolustus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], ''[[The Defense of the Sampo]]'', 1896, [[Turku Art Museum]].]]\n\n=== Visual arts, design, and architecture ===\n{{See also|Architecture of Finland|Art in Finland}}\nThe visual arts in Finland started to form their individual characteristics in the 19th century, when Romantic nationalism was rising in autonomic Finland. The best known of Finnish painters, [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]], started painting in a naturalist style, but moved to national romanticism. Finland's best-known sculptor of the twentieth century was [[W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen]], remembered for his monumental [[Bust (sculpture)|busts]] and sculptures. Finns have made major contributions to [[handicraft]]s and [[industrial design]]: among the internationally renowned figures are [[Timo Sarpaneva]], [[Tapio Wirkkala]] and [[Ilmari Tapiovaara]]. Finnish architecture is famous around the world, and has contributed significantly to several styles internationally, such as [[Jugendstil]] (or [[Art Nouveau]]), [[Nordic Classicism]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]]. Among the top twentieth-century Finnish architects to gain international recognition are [[Eliel Saarinen]] and his son [[Eero Saarinen]]. Architect [[Alvar Aalto]] is regarded as among the most important twentieth-century designers in the world;<ref>James Stevens Curl, ''Dictionary of Architecture'', Grange Books, Rochester, 2005, p. 1.</ref> he helped bring [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist architecture]] to Finland, but soon was a pioneer in its development towards an organic style.<ref>Sigfried Giedion, ''Space, Time and Architecture: The Growth of a New Tradition'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2nd edition, 1949.</ref> Aalto is also famous for his work in furniture, lamps, textiles and [[glassware]], which were usually incorporated into his buildings.\n\n=== Music ===\n[[File:Jean Sibelius, 1913.jpg|thumb|upright|The Finnish composer [[Jean Sibelius]] (1865\u20131957), a significant figure in the history of [[European classical music|classical music]].]]\n{{Main|Music of Finland|Rock music in Finland|Sami music}}\n\n;Classical\nMuch of Finland's classical music is influenced by traditional Karelian melodies and lyrics, as comprised in the ''[[Kalevala]]''. Karelian culture is perceived as the purest expression of the [[Finnic peoples|Finnic]] myths and beliefs, less influenced by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] influence than the [[Nordic folk dance music]] that largely replaced the kalevaic tradition. Finnish [[folk music]] has undergone a [[roots revival]] in recent decades, and has become a part of [[popular music]].\n\nThe people of northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway, the [[Sami people|Sami]], are known primarily for highly spiritual songs called [[joik]]. The same word sometimes refers to [[lavlu]] or vuelie songs, though this is technically incorrect.\n\nThe first Finnish opera was written by the German-born composer [[Fredrik Pacius]] in 1852. Pacius also wrote the music to the poem [[Maamme|''Maamme/V\u00e5rt land'' (Our Country)]], Finland's [[national anthem]]. In the 1890s Finnish nationalism based on the ''Kalevala'' spread, and [[Jean Sibelius]] became famous for his vocal symphony ''[[Kullervo (Sibelius)|Kullervo]]''. He soon received a grant to study ''runo singers'' in Karelia and continued his rise as the first prominent Finnish musician. In 1899 he composed ''[[Finlandia]]'', which played its important role in Finland gaining independence. He remains one of Finland's most popular national figures and is a symbol of the nation.\n\nToday, Finland has a very lively classical music scene and many of Finland's important [[List of Finnish composers|composers]] are still alive, such as [[Magnus Lindberg (Finnish composer)|Magnus Lindberg]], [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Kalevi Aho]], and [[Aulis Sallinen]]. The composers are accompanied by a large number of great conductors such as [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], [[Osmo V\u00e4nsk\u00e4]], [[Jukka-Pekka Saraste]], and [[Leif Segerstam]]. Some of the internationally acclaimed Finnish classical musicians are [[Karita Mattila]], [[Soile Isokoski]], [[Pekka Kuusisto]], [[Olli Mustonen]], and [[Linda Brava|Linda Lampenius]].\n\n;Modern\n[[File:Apocalyptica1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Perttu Kivilaakso]] of [[Apocalyptica]].]]\n''Iskelm\u00e4'' (coined directly from the German word ''[[Schlager]]'', meaning \"hit\") is a traditional Finnish word for a light popular song. Finnish popular music also includes various kinds of [[dance music]]; [[Tango music|tango]], a style of [[Music of Argentina|Argentine music]], is also popular. The light music in Swedish-speaking areas has more influences from Sweden. Modern Finnish popular music includes a number of prominent rock bands, [[jazz]] musicians, [[hip hop]] performers, dance music acts, etc.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nDuring the early 1960s, the first significant wave of Finnish rock groups emerged, playing [[instrumental rock]] inspired by groups such as [[The Shadows]]. Around 1964, [[Beatlemania]] arrived in Finland, resulting in further development of the local rock scene. During the late 1960s and 1970s, Finnish rock musicians increasingly wrote their own music instead of translating international hits into Finnish. During the decade, some [[progressive rock]] groups such as [[Tasavallan Presidentti]] and [[Wigwam (Finnish band)|Wigwam]] gained respect abroad but failed to make a commercial breakthrough outside Finland. This was also the fate of the [[rock and roll]] group [[Hurriganes]]. The Finnish punk scene produced some internationally acknowledged names including [[Terveet K\u00e4det]] in the 1980s. [[Hanoi Rocks]] was a pioneering 1980s [[glam rock]] act that inspired the American [[hard rock]] group [[Guns N' Roses]], among others.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304587704577333813382925678|title=Guns N' Roses Can Agree on at Least One Thing: This Finnish Saxophonist Rocks |last=Shah|first=Neil|date=15 April 2012|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>\n\nMany Finnish metal bands have gained international recognition.

At the [[1912 Summer Olympics]], great pride was taken in the three gold medals won by the original \"[[Flying Finn]]\" [[Hannes Kolehmainen]].\n\nFinland was one of the most successful countries at the Olympic Games before [[World War II]]. At the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], Finland, a nation then of only 3.2 million people, came second in the medal count. In the 1920s and 1930s, Finnish long-distance runners dominated the Olympics, with [[Paavo Nurmi]] winning a total of nine Olympic gold medals between 1920 and 1928 and setting 22 official world records between 1921 and 1931. Nurmi is often considered the greatest Finnish sportsman and one of the greatest athletes of all time.\n\nFor over 100 years, Finnish male and female athletes have consistently excelled at the [[javelin throw]]. The event has brought Finland nine Olympic gold medals, five world championships, five European championships, and 24 world records.\n\nIn addition to Kolehmainen and Nurmi, some of Finland's most internationally well-known and successful sportspeople are long-distance runners [[Ville Ritola]] and [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]]; ski-jumpers [[Matti Nyk\u00e4nen]] and [[Janne Ahonen]]; cross-country skiers [[Veikko Hakulinen]], [[Eero M\u00e4ntyranta]], [[Marja-Liisa Kirvesniemi]] and [[Mika Myllyl\u00e4]]; rower [[Pertti Karppinen]]; gymnast [[Heikki Savolainen (gymnast)|Heikki Savolainen]]; professional skateboarder [[Arto Saari]]; ice hockey players [[Kimmo Timonen]], [[Jari Kurri]], [[Teemu Sel\u00e4nne]], and [[Saku Koivu]]; football players [[Jari Litmanen]] and [[Sami Hyypi\u00e4]]; basketball player [[Hanno M\u00f6tt\u00f6l\u00e4]]; alpine skiers [[Kalle Palander]] and [[Tanja Poutiainen]]; Formula One world champions [[Keke Rosberg]], [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] and [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]]; four-time World Rally champions [[Juha Kankkunen]] and [[Tommi M\u00e4kinen]]; and 13-time World [[Enduro]] Champion [[Juha Salminen]], seven-time champion [[Kari Tiainen]], and the five-time champions [[Mika Ahola]], biathlete [[Kaisa M\u00e4k\u00e4r\u00e4inen]] and [[Samuli Aro]].

While President Lincoln attempted to foster friendship and forgiveness between the Union and the former Confederacy, [[Assassination of Abraham Lincoln|an assassin's bullet]] on April 14, 1865, drove a wedge between North and South again. Republicans in the federal government made it their goal to oversee the rebuilding of the South and to ensure the rights of African Americans.

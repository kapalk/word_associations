Its members are mostly nomadic goat herdsmen, distributed from the Bol\u0101n Pass through the Br\u0101hui Hills to Cape Muar\u012b on the Arabian Sea. The Brahui language is a far northwestern member of the Dravidian family of languages, all of whose other members are spoken in peninsular India; it has borrowed heavily from Sindhi but remains in unexplained isolation among the surrounding Indo-Iranian dialects, to which it bears no genetic relationship. The Brahui are estimated to number about 1,560,000. Physically the Brahui resemble their Baloch and Pashtun neighbours, for the confederacy has been highly absorptive. They are Muslim by creed and Sunnite by sect, though the Muslim rites overlie essentially Indian social customs. Women are not strictly secluded. The 29 tribes owe a loose allegiance to the Brahui khan of Kal\u0101t, which has long been associated with the confederacy's destinies. A group of eight tribes forms what is believed to be the original Brahui nucleus and constitutes about one-eleventh of the Brahui population. To these nuclear tribes have been affiliated many indigenous and captive peoples. The Brahui rose to power in the 17th century, overthrowing a dynasty of Hindu rajas. Under Na\u1e63\u012br Kh\u0101n, the confederacy attained its zenith in the 18th century. Their subsequent history centred on the state of Kal\u0101t, which joined Pakistan in 1948.}}</ref><ref name=\"britishcouncil.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/pakistan-ette-english-language-report.pdf |title=Teaching and Learning in Pakistan: The Role of Language in Education |publisher=British Council.Org |pages=13, 14, 15 |year=2010|access-date=29 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304130317/http://www.britishcouncil.org/pakistan-ette-english-language-report.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2011}}</ref> [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] community leaders in Pakistan claim that there are 3&nbsp;million [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] speakers in Karachi.<ref name=\":72\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/57104-with-a-handful-of-subberstwo-newspapers-barely-keeping-gujarati-alive-in-karachi |title=With a handful of subbers, two newspapers barely keeping Gujarati alive in Karachi |last=Rehman |first=Zia Ur |date=18 August 2015 |work=The News International |quote=In Pakistan, the majority of Gujarati-speaking communities are in Karachi including Dawoodi Bohras, Ismaili Khojas, Memons, Kathiawaris, Katchhis, Parsis (Zoroastrians) and Hindus, said Gul Hasan Kalmati, a researcher who authored \"Karachi, Sindh Jee Marvi\", a book discussing the city and its indigenous communities.

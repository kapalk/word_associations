Successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes, by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing. This work, which included linking producers to wholesalers, helped to increase local producer prices by 20\u201325% in Nairobi and Mombasa. The commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets, ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock, and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty.<ref>[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 Pigeonpea in Eastern and Southern Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718193632/http://exploreit.icrisat.org/page/eastern_and_southern_africa/887/329 |date=18 July 2014 }}.

This would create a direct and robust delivery framework for the Action Plan and ensure climate change is treated as an economy-wide issue.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/2013/03/news-kenyas-national-climate-change-action-plan-is-officially-launched/ NEWS: Kenya's National Climate Change Action Plan is officially launched], Climate & Development Knowledge Network, 28 March 2013</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ style=\"line-height:1.0em;\"| {{resize|120%|Economic summary}}\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| GDP\n| $41.84&nbsp;billion (2012) at Market Price. $76.07&nbsp;billion (Purchasing Power Parity, 2012)\nThere exists an informal economy that is never counted as part of the official GDP figures.\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| Annual growth rate\n| 5.1% (2012)\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| Per capita income\n| Per Capita Income (PPP)= $1,800\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| Agricultural&nbsp;produce{{nbsp|2}}\n| tea, coffee, [[Maize|corn]], wheat, [[sugarcane]], fruit, vegetables, dairy products, beef, pork, poultry, eggs\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| Industry\n| small-scale consumer goods (plastic, furniture, batteries, textiles, clothing, soap, cigarettes, flour), agricultural products, horticulture, oil refining; aluminium, steel, lead; cement, commercial ship repair, tourism\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+ style=\"line-height:1.0em;\"| Trade in 2012\n|-\n\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| Exports\n| $5.942&nbsp;billion\n| tea, coffee, horticultural products, petroleum products, cement, fish\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| Major markets\n|colspan=\"2\"|[[Uganda]] 9.9%, [[Tanzania]] 9.6%, Netherlands 8.4%, UK, 8.1%, US 6.2%, Egypt 4.9%, Democratic Republic of the Congo 4.2% (2012)<ref name=cia/>\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| Imports\n| $14.39&nbsp;billion\n| machinery and transportation equipment, petroleum products, motor vehicles, iron and steel, resins and plastics\n|-\n!style=\"text-align:left;\"| Major&nbsp;suppliers\n|colspan=\"2\"| China 15.3%, [[India]] 13.8%, UAE 10.5%, Saudi Arabia 7.3%, South Africa 5.5%, Japan 4.0% (2012)<ref name=cia/>\n|}\n\n===Oil exploration===\n{{See also|Energy in Kenya#Petroleum|l1=Oil in Kenya}}\n[[File:Kenya Aerial 2009-08-27 14-26-44.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Lake Turkana]] borders Turkana County]]\n\nKenya has proven oil deposits in [[Turkana County]].

Private healthcare businesses and companies are the main health care providers in the country even for the nation's poorest people.

Private health facilities are diverse and cater for all economic groups. Hospitals such as the [[Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi|Aga Khan Hospital]] and the [[Mombasa Hospital]] are comparable to many preferred hospitals in the developed world but are expensive and accessible only to the rich and the insured. Many affordable and low-cost private medical institutions and clinics exist and are easily accessible to ordinary and [[middle-class]] residents but are commonly unregistered and unlicensed and run by similarly unregistered and unlicensed personnel posing a grave danger to the public. All registered medical facilities are subjected to regular supervisory and supportive visits from a joint multi-cadre team of health officials from the county government and national regulatory bodies in order to meet the legal threshold of the '''Fair Administrative Action Act, 2015''' and may choose to undergo additional supportive and quality assurance and improvement processes by operating under a social franchise such as the joint government-donor funded [[Population Services International|Tunza Family Network]].\n\nThe control of medical practice by laymen through limited liability companies, county governments and other artificial legal entities is widespread and largely tolerated unlike other countries where medical affairs are strictly handled by medical professionals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbc.ca.gov/Licensees/Corporate_Practice.aspx|title=Corporate Practice - Licensees - Medical Board of California|first=Medical Board of|last=California|website=www.mbc.ca.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe health sector and health facilities are not protected by any special laws and are prone to mismanagement with health workers frequently being subjected to verbal, emotional and physical abuse by patients and administrators alike.\n\nThe public health sector consists of community-based (level I) services which are run by community health workers, dispensaries (level II facilities) which are run by nurses, health centers (level III facilities) which are run by clinical officers, sub-county hospitals (level IV facilities) which may be run by a clinical officer or a medical officer, county hospitals (level V facilities) which may be run by a medical officer or a medical practitioner, and national referral hospitals (level VI facilities) which are run by fully qualified medical practitioners (consultants and sub-specialists).\n\n[[File:Table rco co mo medical practitioners.png|thumb|Table showing different grades of clinical officers, medical officers and medical practitioners in Kenya's public service]][[Nurses]] are by far the largest group of [[front-line]] health care providers in all sectors followed by [[clinical officer]]s, [[medical officer]]s and [[medical practitioner]]s.

Graduates from the polytechnics and colleges can then join the workforce and later obtain a specialized higher diploma qualification after a further one to two years of training, or join the university\u2014usually in the second or third year of their respective course. The [[higher diploma]] is accepted by many employers in place of a bachelor's degree and direct or accelerated admission to post-graduate studies is possible in some universities.\n\n[[File:Masai girl at school doing maths.jpg|thumb|A Maasai girl at school.]]\n\nPublic universities in Kenya are highly commercialized institutions and only a small fraction of qualified high school graduates are admitted on limited government-sponsorship into programs of their choice. Most are admitted into the social sciences, which are cheap to run, or as self-sponsored students paying the full cost of their studies.

Preschool, which targets children from age three to five, is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to Standard One (First Grade). At the end of primary education, pupils sit the [[Kenya Certificate of Primary Education]] (KCPE), which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training.  The result of this examination is needed for placement at secondary school.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nPrimary school is for students aged 6/7-13/14 years. For those who proceed to the secondary level, there is a national examination at the end of Form Four&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education]] (KCSE), which determines those proceeding to the universities, other professional training or employment. Students sit [[examinations]] in eight subjects of their choosing. However, English, Kiswahili and mathematics are compulsory subjects.\n\nThe Kenya Universities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS), formerly the Joint Admissions Board (JAB),  is responsible for selecting students joining the public universities. Other than the public schools, there are many private schools, mainly in urban areas. Similarly, there are a number of [[international school]]s catering to various overseas educational systems.\n\nDespite its impressive commercial approach and interests in the country, Kenya's [[academia]] and higher education system is notoriously rigid and disconnected from the needs of the local labour market and is widely blamed for the high number of unemployable and \"half-baked\" university graduates who struggle to fit in the modern workplace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/news/Varsity-expansion-blamed-for-half-baked-graduates/539546-3354256-108r90o/index.html|title=Varsity expansion blamed for half-baked graduates|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of Kenya}}\n[[File:Kenyan dancers.jpg|thumb|Kenyan boys and girls performing a traditional dance]]\n[[File:Nation media house.jpg|thumb|Nation Media House which hosts the [[Nation Media Group]]]]\n\nThe [[culture of Kenya]] consists of multiple traditions. Kenya has no single prominent culture that identifies it. It instead consists of the various cultures of the country's different communities.\n\nNotable populations include the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] on the coast, several other [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] communities in the central and western regions, and Nilotic communities in the northwest. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] culture is well known to tourism, despite constituting a relatively small part of Kenya's population. They are renowned for their elaborate upper body adornment and jewellery.\n\nAdditionally, Kenya has an extensive music, television and theater scene.\n\n===Media===\n{{Further|Media of Kenya}}\nKenya has a number of media outlets that broadcast domestically and globally. They cover news, business, sports and entertainment.\nPopular Kenyan newspapers include:\n\n*  ''[[Daily Nation|The Daily Nation]]''; part of the [[Nation Media Group|Nation Media Group (NMG)]] (largest market share)\n*  ''[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]''\n*  ''The Star''\n*  ''The People''\n*  ''East Africa Weekly''\n*  ''[[Taifa Leo]]''\n\nTelevision stations based in Kenya include:\n*  [[Kenya Broadcasting Corporation]] (KBC)\n*  [[Citizen TV]]\n*  [[Kenya Television Network]] (KTN)\n*  [[NTV (Kenya)|NTV]] (part of the [[Nation Media Group]] (NMG))\n*  Kiss Television\n*  [[K24 (Kenya)|K24 Television]]\n*  Kass-TV\n\nAll of these terrestrial channels are transmitted via a DVB T2 digital TV signal.\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Kenyan literature}}\n[[File:Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o (signing autographs in London).jpg|thumb|Kenyan author [[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]].]]\n\n[[Ng\u0169g\u0129 wa Thiong'o]] is one of the best known writers of Kenya. His novel, ''[[Weep Not, Child]]'', is an illustration of life in Kenya during the British occupation. The story details the effects of the Mau Mau on the lives of Kenyans. Its combination of themes\u2014[[colonialism]], education, and love\u2014helped to make it one of the best-known novels in Africa.\n\n[[M.G. Vassanji]]'s 2003 novel ''The In-Between World of Vikram Lall'' won the [[Scotiabank Giller Prize|Giller Prize]] in 2003. It is the fictional memoir of a Kenyan of Indian heritage and his family as they adjust to the changing political climates in colonial and post-colonial Kenya.\n\nSince 2003, the literary journal ''[[Kwani?]]'' has been publishing Kenyan contemporary literature. Additionally, Kenya has also been nurturing emerging versatile authors such as Paul Kipchumba (Kipwendui, Kibiwott) who demonstrate pan-African outlook (see ''Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy'' (2017).<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa in China's 21st Century: In Search of a Strategy|publisher= Independently published |date=December 3, 2017|isbn = 978-1973456803}}</ref>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Kenya}}\n[[File:Juacali 2.jpg|thumb|Popular Kenyan musician [[Jua Cali]].]]\n\nKenya has a diverse assortment of popular music forms, in addition to multiple types of [[folk music]] based on the variety over 40 regional languages.<ref>[http://www.wipo.int/wipo_magazine/en/2007/04/article_0001.html On the Beat \u2013 Tapping the Potential of Kenya's Music Industry], [[WIPO]] Magazine (July 2007).</ref>\n\nThe drums are the most dominant [[musical instrument|instrument]] in popular Kenyan music. Drum beats are very complex and include both native rhythm and imported ones, especially the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] [[cavacha]] rhythm. Popular Kenyan music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts, and more recently, showy guitar solos as well. There are also a number of local hip-hop artists, including [[Jua Cali]] and afro-pop bands such as [[Sauti Sol]].\n\nLyrics are most often in Kiswahili or English. There is also some emerging aspect of [[Lingala language|Lingala]] borrowed from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] musicians. Lyrics are also written in local languages. Urban radio generally only plays English music, though there also exist a number of vernacular radio stations.\n\nZilizopendwa is a genre of local urban music that was recorded in the 1960s, 70s and 80s by musicians such as [[Daudi Kabaka]], [[Fadhili William]] and Sukuma Bin Ongaro, and is particularly revered and enjoyed by older people\u2014having been popularised by the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation's Kiswahili service (formerly called Voice of Kenya or VOK).\n\nThe isukuti is a vigorous dance performed by the [[Luhya people|Luhya]] sub-tribes to the beat of a traditional drum called the Isukuti during many occasions such as the birth of a child, marriage and funerals. Other traditional dances include the [[Ohangla]] among the [[Luo peoples|Luo]], [[Nzele]] among the [[Mijikenda peoples|Mijikenda]], [[Mugithi]] among the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] and [[Taarab]] among the [[Swahili people|Swahili]].\n\nAdditionally, Kenya has a growing Christian gospel music scene. Prominent local gospel musicians include the [[Kenyan Boys Choir]].\n\n[[Benga music]] has been popular since the late 1960s, especially in the area around [[Lake Victoria]]. The word ''benga'' is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music. Bass, guitar and percussion are the usual instruments.\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Kenya}}\n[[File:2012 Olympics - Womens 5000m start 4.jpg|thumb|Jepkosgei Kipyego and Jepkemoi Cheruiyot at London 2012 Olympics 5,000 meters]]\n\nKenya is active in several sports, among them [[cricket]], [[rallying]], [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]] and [[boxing]]. The country is known chiefly for its dominance in [[middle-distance running|middle-distance]] and [[long-distance running|long-distance]] athletics, having consistently produced [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]] champions in various distance events, especially in 800&nbsp;m, 1,500&nbsp;m, 3,000&nbsp;m steeplechase, 5,000&nbsp;m, 10,000&nbsp;m and the marathon. Kenyan athletes (particularly [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]]) continue to dominate the world of distance running, although competition from [[Morocco]] and [[Ethiopia]] has reduced this supremacy. Kenya's best-known athletes included the four-time women's [[Boston Marathon]] winner and two-time world champion [[Catherine Ndereba]], 800m world record holder [[David Rudisha]], former [[Marathon (sport)|Marathon]] world record-holder [[Paul Tergat]], and [[John Ngugi]].\n\nKenya won several medals during the Beijing Olympics, six gold, four silver and four bronze, making it Africa's most successful nation in the 2008 Olympics. New athletes gained attention, such as [[Pamela Jelimo]], the women's 800m gold medalist who went on to win the [[IAAF Golden League]] jackpot, and [[Samuel Wanjiru]] who won the men's marathon. Retired Olympic and Commonwealth Games champion [[Kipchoge Keino]] helped usher in Kenya's ongoing distance dynasty in the 1970s and was followed by Commonwealth Champion [[Henry Rono]]'s spectacular string of world record performances.

Paraguay was the epicenter of the [[Reductions|Jesuit Missions]], where the [[Guaran\u00ed people]] were educated and introduced to [[Christianity]] and European culture under the direction of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Jesuit reduction]]s, mainly during the 17th century.<ref>Caraman, Philip (1976): \"The lost paradise: the Jesuit Republic in South America\", New York: Seabury Press.</ref> However, after the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|expulsion of the Jesuits]] from Spanish territories in 1767, Paraguay increasingly became a peripheral colony, with few urban centers and settlers. Following [[Independence of Paraguay|independence from Spain]] at the beginning of the 19th century, Paraguay was ruled by a series of [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] governments who generally implemented [[nationalist]], [[isolationism|isolationist]] and [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies. This period ended with the disastrous [[Paraguayan War]], during which Paraguay lost at least 50% of its prewar population and around 25\u201333% of its territory to the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]]. In the 20th century, Paraguay faced another major international conflict \u2013 the [[Chaco War]] \u2013 against Bolivia, from which the Paraguayans emerged victorious. Afterwards, the country entered a period of military dictatorships, ending with the 35 year regime of [[Alfredo Stroessner]] that lasted until he was toppled in 1989 by an internal military coup. This marked the beginning of the \"democratic era\" of Paraguay.\n\nWith around 7 million inhabitants, Paraguay is a founding member of [[Mercosur]], an original member of the [[United Nations]], the [[Organization of American States]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[Lima Group]]. Also, the city of [[Luque]], in Asuncion's Metropolitan Area, is the seat of the [[CONMEBOL]]. The Guarani culture is very influential and more than 90% of the people speak different forms of the Guarani language on top of Spanish. Paraguayans are known for being a very happy and easy-living people and many times the country topped the \"world's happiest place\" charts because of the \"positive experiences\" lived and expressed by the population.<ref>{{cite news|title=World's Happiest Country?

Western Paraguay, the [[Gran Chaco]], was inhabited by nomads of whom the [[Guaycuru]] peoples were the most prominent. The Paraguay River was roughly the dividing line between the agricultural Guarani people to the east and the nomadic and semi-nomadic people to the west in the Gran Chaco. The Guarcuru nomads were known for their warrior traditions and were not fully pacified until the late 19th century. These indigenous tribes belonged to five distinct language families, which were the bases of their major divisions. Differing language speaking groups were generally competitive over resources and territories. They were further divided into tribes by speaking languages in branches of these families. Today 17 separate [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] groups remain.\n\n=== Colonization ===\nThe first Europeans in the area were Spanish explorers in 1516.<ref name=eec>Sacks, Richard S. \"Early explorers and conquistadors\". In Hanratty & Meditz.</ref> The Spanish explorer [[Juan de Salazar de Espinosa]] founded the settlement of [[Asunci\u00f3n]] on 15 August 1537. The city eventually became the center of a [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial province of Paraguay]].\n\nAn attempt to create an autonomous Christian Indian nation <ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\">{{cite web |url={{wdl|2581}} |title=Paraguariae Provinciae Soc.

They developed [[Jesuit reduction]]s to bring Guarani populations together at Spanish missions and protect them from virtual slavery by Spanish settlers and Portuguese slave raiders, the [[Bandeirantes]]. In addition to seeking their conversion to Christianity. Catholicism in Paraguay was influenced by the indigenous peoples; the [[syncretic]] religion has absorbed native elements. The ''reducciones'' flourished in eastern Paraguay for about 150 years, until the expulsion of the Jesuits by the Spanish Crown in 1767. The ruins of two 18th-century [[Jesuit Missions of La Sant\u00edsima Trinidad de Paran\u00e1 and Jes\u00fas de Tavarangue]] have been designated as [[World Heritage Sites]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=\"cite wdl|#2581\"/>\n\nIn western Paraguay Spanish settlement and Christianity were strongly resisted by the nomadic Guaycuru and other nomads from the 16th century onward. Most of these peoples were absorbed into the [[mestizo]] population in the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\n=== Independence and rule of Francia===\n{{main|Independence of Paraguay}}\n[[File:Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia.jpg|left|thumb|[[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], Paraguay's first dictator.]]\nParaguay overthrew the local Spanish administration on 14 May 1811. Paraguay's first dictator was [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]] who ruled Paraguay from 1814 until his death in 1840, with very little outside contact or influence.

Because of Francia's restrictions of freedom, [[Fulgencio Yegros]] and several other Independence-era leaders in 1820 planned a ''coup d\u2019\u00e9tat'' against Francia, who discovered the plot and had its leaders either executed or imprisoned for life.\n\n===Rule of the L\u00f3pez family===\nAfter Francia's death in 1840, Paraguay was ruled by various military officers under a new ''[[military junta|junta]]'', until [[Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez]] (allegedly Rodr\u00edguez de Francia's nephew) came to power in 1841. L\u00f3pez modernized Paraguay and opened it to foreign commerce. He signed a [[non-aggression pact]] with Argentina and officially declared independence of Paraguay in 1842. After L\u00f3pez's death in 1862, power was transferred to his eldest son, [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez]].\n\nThe regime of the L\u00f3pez family was characterized by pervasive and rigid centralism in production and distribution. There was no distinction between the public and the private spheres, and the L\u00f3pez family ruled the country as it would a large estate.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+py0019) \"Carlos Antonio L\u00f3pez\"], Library of Congress Country Studies, December 1988.

This view is usually contested by the \"''anti-lopistas''\" (also known in Paraguay as \"''legionarios''\"), who favoured the \"Triple Alliance\". Revisionist views, both from right and left wing national-populists, put a great emphasis on the influence of the British Empire in the conflict, a view that is discarded by a majority of historians.</ref>\n\nParaguay lost 25-33% of its territory to Argentina and Brazil, was forced to pay an enormous war debt and to sell large amounts of national properties in order to restore its internal budget. But the worst consequence of the war was the catastrophic loss of population. At least 50% of the Paraguayans died during the conflict and took long decades for the country to recover. About the disaster suffered by the Paraguayans at the outcome of the war, [[William D.

After great losses Paraguay defeated Bolivia and established its sovereignty over most of the disputed Chaco region. After the war, military officers used popular dissatisfaction with the Liberal politicians to seize the power for themselves. On 17 February 1936, the [[February Revolution (Paraguay)|February Revolution]] brought colonel [[Rafael Franco]] to power. Between 1940 and 1948, the country was ruled by general [[Higinio Mor\u00ednigo]].

Paraguay actively participated in [[Operation Condor]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dinges |first1=John |title=Operation Condor |url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/chile/operation-condor.htm |website=latinamericanstudies.org |publisher=Columbia University}}</ref> Torture and death for political opponents was routine. After his overthrow, the ''Colorado'' continued to dominate national politics until 2008.\n\nThe splits in the ''Colorado'' Party in the 1980s, and the prevailing conditions: Stroessner's advanced age, the character of the regime, the economic downturn, and [[international isolation]], were catalysts for anti-regime demonstrations and statements by the opposition prior to the 1988 general elections.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n''[[Authentic Radical Liberal Party|PLRA]]'' leader [[Domingo La\u00edno]] served as the focal point of the opposition in the second half of the 1980s. The government's effort to isolate Laino by exiling him in 1982 had backfired. On his sixth attempt to re-enter the country in 1986, Laino returned with three television crews from the U.S., a former United States ambassador to Paraguay, and a group of Uruguayan and Argentine congressmen. Despite the international contingent, the police violently barred Laino's return.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Stroessner regime relented in April 1987, and permitted Laino to return to Asunci\u00f3n. Laino took the lead in organizing demonstrations and reducing infighting among the opposition party. The opposition was unable to reach agreement on a common strategy regarding the elections, with some parties advocating abstention, and others calling for blank voting. The parties held numerous 'lightning demonstrations' (''m\u00edtines rel\u00e1mpagos''), especially in rural areas. Such demonstrations were gathered and quickly disbanded before the arrival of the police.\n\nIn response to the upsurge in opposition activities, Stroessner condemned the Accord for advocating \"sabotage of the general elections and disrespect of the law\".  He used national police and civilian [[vigilantes]] of the ''Colorado'' Party to break up demonstrations. A number of opposition leaders were imprisoned or otherwise harassed. [[Hermes Rafael Saguier]], another key leader of the ''PLRA'', was imprisoned for four months in 1987 on charges of sedition. In early February 1988, police arrested 200 people attending a National Coordinating Committee meeting in [[Coronel Oviedo]]. Laino and several other opposition figures were arrested before dawn on the day of the election, 14 February, and held for twelve hours. The government declared Stroessner's re-election with 89% of the vote.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/15/world/paraguayan-wins-his-eighth-term.html?scp=3&sq=Paraguay%20february%201988&st=cse \"Paraguayan Wins His Eighth Term\"], ''The New York Times'', 15 February 1988.</ref>\n\nThe opposition attributed the results in part to the virtual Colorado monopoly on the mass media. They noted that 53% of those polled indicated that there was an \"uneasiness\" in Paraguayan society. 74% believed that the political situation needed changes, including 45% who wanted a substantial or total change. Finally, 31% stated that they planned to abstain from voting in the February elections. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Stroessner's overthrow, post-1989===\nOn 3 February 1989, Stroessner was overthrown in a military coup headed by General [[Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez (President)|Andr\u00e9s Rodr\u00edguez]]. As president, Rodr\u00edguez instituted political, legal, and economic reforms and initiated a ''rapprochement'' with the international community. Reflecting the deep hunger of the rural poor for land, hundreds immediately occupied thousands of acres of unused territories belonging to Stroessner and his associates; by mid-1990, 19,000 families occupied {{convert|340000|acres|-3|abbr=on}}. At the time, 2.06 million people lived in rural areas, more than half of the 4.1 million total population, and most were landless.<ref name=\"nagel\"/>\n\nThe June 1992 constitution established a democratic system of government and dramatically improved protection of fundamental human rights. In May 1993, Colorado Party candidate [[Juan Carlos Wasmosy]] was elected as Paraguay's first civilian president in almost 40 years, in what international observers deemed fair and free elections.\n\nWith support from the United States, the Organization of American States, and other countries in the region, the Paraguayan people rejected an April 1996 attempt by then Army Chief General [[Lino Oviedo]] to oust President Wasmosy.\n\nOviedo was nominated as the Colorado candidate for president in the 1998 election, however, when the Supreme Court upheld in April his conviction on charges related to the 1996 coup attempt, he was not allowed to run and was detained in jail. His former running mate, [[Ra\u00fal Cubas]], became the Colorado Party's candidate, and was elected in May in elections deemed by international observers to be free and fair. One of Cubas' first acts after taking office in August was to commute Oviedo's sentence and release him. In December 1998, Paraguay's Supreme Court declared these actions unconstitutional. In this tense atmosphere, the murder of Vice President and long-time Oviedo rival [[Luis Mar\u00eda Arga\u00f1a]] on 23 March 1999, led the Chamber of Deputies to impeach Cubas the next day.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} On 26 March, eight student anti-government demonstrators were murdered, widely believed to have been carried out by Oviedo supporters. This increased opposition to Cubas, who resigned on 28 March. Senate President [[Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Macchi]], a Cubas opponent, was peacefully sworn in as president the same day.\n\nIn 2003, Nicanor Duarte Frutos was elected as president.\n\n===Election of Fernando Lugo===\nFor the 2008 general elections, the Colorado Party was favored in polls. Their candidate was Minister of Education [[Blanca Ovelar]], the first woman to be nominated as a candidate for a major party in Paraguayan history. After sixty years of Colorado rule, voters chose [[Fernando Lugo]], a former Roman Catholic Bishop and not a professional politician in civil government, and a member of the Authentic Radical Liberal Party, Paraguay's largest opposition party. Lugo was an adherent of [[liberation theology]]. Lugo achieved a historic victory in Paraguay's presidential election, defeating the ruling party candidate, and ending 61 years of conservative rule. Lugo won with nearly 41% of the vote, compared to almost 31% for Blanca Ovelar of the Colorado party.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.electstud.2008.10.001 | author = Nickson, Andrew | year = 2009 | title = The general election in Paraguay, April 2008 | journal = Journal of Electoral Studies | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 145\u20139 }}</ref> Outgoing President Nicanor Duarte Frutos hailed the moment as the first time in the history of the nation that a government had transferred power to opposition forces in a constitutional and peaceful fashion.\n\nLugo was sworn in on 15 August 2008.

The eastern region (Regi\u00f3n Oriental); and the western region, officially called Western Paraguay (Regi\u00f3n Occidental) and also known as the Chaco, which is part of the [[Gran Chaco]]. The country lies between latitudes [[19th parallel south|19\u00b0]] and [[28th parallel south|28\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[54th meridian west|54\u00b0]] and [[63rd meridian west|63\u00b0W]].\nThe terrain consists mostly of grassy plains and wooded hills in the eastern region. To the west are mostly low, marshy plains.\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of Paraguay}}\nThe overall climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subtropical climate|subtropical]]. Like most lands in the region, Paraguay has only wet and dry periods. Winds play a major role in influencing Paraguay's weather: between October and March, warm winds blow from the Amazon Basin in the North, while the period between May and August brings cold winds from the Andes.\n\nThe absence of mountain ranges to provide a natural barrier allows winds to develop speeds as high as {{convert|161|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This also leads to significant changes in temperature within a short span of time; between April and September, temperatures will sometimes drop below freezing. January is the hottest summer month, with an average daily temperature of 28.9 degrees Celsius (84 degrees F).\n\nRainfall varies dramatically across the country, with substantial rainfall in the eastern portions, and semi-arid conditions in the far west. The far eastern forest belt receives an average of {{convert|170|cm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} of rain annually, while the western Chaco region typically averages no more than {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} a year. The rains in the west tend to be irregular and evaporate quickly, contributing to the aridity of the area.\n\n==Government and politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Paraguay |Human rights in Paraguay|Foreign relations of Paraguay}}\nParaguay is a [[representative democratic]] republic, with a multi-party system and [[separation of powers]] in three branches.

Their culture is highly influenced by various European countries, including Spain. Therefore, Paraguayan culture is a fusion of two cultures and traditions; one European, the other, Southern Guaran\u00ed. More than 93% of Paraguayans are ''[[mestizos]]'', making Paraguay one of the most homogeneous countries in Latin America. A characteristic of this cultural fusion is the extensive bilingualism present to this day: more than 80% of Paraguayans speak both [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and the indigenous language, [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]]. [[Jopara]], a mixture of Guaran\u00ed and Spanish, is also widely spoken.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival Paraguay.jpg|thumb|Ovecha Ragu\u00e9 Festival]]\nThis cultural fusion is expressed in arts such as embroidery (''ao po'\u00ed'') and [[Nanduti|lace making]] (''\u00f1andut\u00ed''). The [[music of Paraguay]], which consists of lilting polkas, bouncy ''galopas,'' and languid ''[[Guarania (music)|guaranias]]'' is played on the native harp. Paraguay's culinary heritage is also deeply influenced by this cultural fusion. Several popular dishes contain [[manioc]], a local staple crop similar to the [[Cassava|yuca]] also known as Cassava root found in the [[Southwestern United States]] and [[Mexico]], as well as other indigenous ingredients. A popular dish is ''[[sopa paraguaya]]'', similar to a thick [[corn bread]]. Another notable food is ''[[chipa]]'', a [[bagel]]-like bread made from [[cornmeal]], manioc, and cheese. Many other dishes consist of different kinds of cheeses, onions, bell peppers, cottage cheese, cornmeal, milk, seasonings, butter, eggs and fresh corn kernels.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were the time of the flowering of a new generation of Paraguayan novelists and poets such as [[Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Maz\u00f3]], [[Roque Vallejos]], and Nobel Prize nominee [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]. Several [[Cinema of Paraguay|Paraguayan films]] have been made.\n\nInside the family, conservative values predominate. In lower classes, godparents have a special relationship to the family, since usually, they are chosen because of their favorable social position, in order to provide extra security for the children. Particular respect is owed them, in return for which the family can expect protection and patronage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/paraguay/29.htm|title=Paraguay - Ritual Kinship|website=countrystudies.us|access-date=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Sports===\n{{Main|Sport in Paraguay}}\nSport in Paraguay is an important part the country's national culture.

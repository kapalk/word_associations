Later came other Dutch explorers, including [[Jacob Le Maire]] (who called on the northern island of [[Niuatoputapu]]); and in 1643 [[Abel Tasman]] (who visited [[Tongatapu]] and [[Ha\u02bbapai]]).

He held the chiefly title of [[Tu\u02bbi Kanokupolu]], but had been baptised by [[Methodist]] missionaries with the name ''Siaosi'' (\"George\") in 1831. In 1875, with the help of missionary [[Shirley Waldemar Baker]], he declared Tonga a constitutional monarchy; formally adopted the western royal style; emancipated the \"serfs\"; enshrined a code of law, land tenure, and freedom of the press; and limited the power of the chiefs.\n\nTonga became a [[protected state]] under a Treaty of Friendship with Britain on 18 May 1900, when European settlers and rival Tongan chiefs tried to oust the second king. The treaty posted no higher permanent representative on Tonga than a British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] (1901\u20131970). Under the protection of Britain, Tonga maintained its sovereignty, and remained the only Pacific nation to retain its monarchical government (unlike [[Kingdom of Tahiti|Tahiti]] and [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawai\u02bbi]]). The Tongan monarchy follows an uninterrupted succession of hereditary rulers from one family.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\nThe [[1918 flu pandemic]], brought to Tonga by a ship from New Zealand, killed 1,800 Tongans, reflecting a mortality rate of about eight per cent.<ref>{{Cite book|first = George C.|last = Kohn|title = Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&pg=PA363|publisher = Infobase Publishing|year = 2008|page = 363|isbn = 978-0-8160-6935-4}}</ref>\n\nThe Treaty of Friendship and Tonga's protection status ended in 1970 under arrangements established by Queen [[Salote Tupou III]] prior to her death in 1965.

Reverence for the monarch replaces that held in earlier centuries for the sacred paramount chief, the Tu\u02bbi Tonga. Criticism of the monarch is held to be contrary to Tongan culture and etiquette. King [[Tupou VI]] (a descendant of the first monarch), his family, powerful nobles and a growing non-royal elite caste live in much wealth, with the rest of the country living in relative poverty. The effects of this disparity are mitigated by education, medicine, and land tenure.\n\nTonga provides for its citizens a free and mandatory education for all, secondary education with only nominal fees, and foreign-funded scholarships for post-secondary education.\n[[File:George Tupou I, c. 1880s.jpg|thumb|[[T\u0101ufa\u02bb\u0101hau]], King of Tonga (1845\u20131893)]]\nThe pro-democracy movement in Tonga promotes reforms, including better representation in the Parliament for the majority of commoners, and better accountability in matters of state. An overthrow of the monarchy is not part of the movement and the institution of monarchy continues to hold popular support, even while reforms are advocated. Until recently, the governance issue was generally ignored by the leaders of other countries, but major aid donors and neighbours New Zealand and Australia are now expressing concerns about some Tongan government actions.\n\nFollowing the precedents of Queen S\u0101lote and the counsel of numerous international advisors,{{Who|date=February 2010}} the government of Tonga under King [[T\u0101ufa\u02bb\u0101hau Tupou IV]] (reigned 1965\u20132006) monetised the economy, internationalised the medical and education system, and enabled access by commoners to increasing forms of material wealth (houses, cars, and other commodities), education, and overseas travel.\n\nTongans have universal access to a national health care system. The [[Constitution of Tonga]] protects land ownership: land cannot be sold to foreigners (although it may be leased<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.propertytonga.com/land-law-in-tonga.html |title=Articles:Listing Tonga |publisher=Property Tonga |accessdate=20 September 2016}}</ref>). While there is a land shortage on the urbanised main island of [[Tongatapu]] (where 70% of the population resides), there is farmland available in the outlying islands. The majority of the population engages in some form of subsistence production of food, with approximately half producing almost all of their basic food needs through farming, sea harvesting, and animal husbandry. Women and men have equal access to education and health care and are fairly equal in employment, but women are discriminated against in land holding, electoral politics, and government ministries{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.\n\n=== Political culture ===\n[[File:Kingtupou.jpg|thumb|[[Tupou VI|King Tupou VI]] during his coronation on \t4 July 2015]]\nThe previous king, T\u0101ufa\u02bb\u0101hau Tupou IV, and his government made some problematic economic decisions and were accused{{By whom|date=February 2010}} of wasting millions of dollars on unwise investments.

The amendment was defended by the government and by royalists on the basis of traditional cultural values. Licensure criteria include 80% ownership by Tongans living in the country. {{As of|2004|2}}, those papers denied licenses under the new act included the ''Taimi \u02bbo Tonga'' (''Tongan Times''), the ''Kele\u02bba,'' and the ''Matangi Tonga''\u2014while those permitted licenses were uniformly church-based or pro-government.\n\n[[File:Royal Palace, Nuku'alofa.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Royal Palace, Tonga|Royal palace of Tonga]]]]\nThe bill was opposed in the form of a several-thousand-strong protest march in the capital, a call by the Tu\u02bbi Pelehake (a prince, nephew of the king and elected member of parliament) for Australia and other nations to pressure the Tongan government to democratise the electoral system, and a legal writ calling for a judicial investigation of the bill. The latter was supported by some 160 signatures, including seven of the nine elected, \"People's Representatives\".\n\nThe then Crown Prince [[George Tupou V|Tupouto\u02bba]] and Pilolevu, the Princess Royal, remained generally silent on the issue. In total, the changes threatened to destabilise the polity, fragment support for the status quo, and place further pressure on the monarchy.\n\nIn 2005, the government spent several weeks negotiating with striking civil-service workers before reaching a settlement.

The royal family and the nobles dominate and largely own the monetary sector of the economy \u2013 particularly the telecommunications and satellite services. Tonga was named the sixth most corrupt country in the world by Forbes magazine in 2008.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/06/25/somalia-myanmar-corruption-bizcountries08-biz-cx_af_lm_0626bizcountries_corruptcountries_slide_7.html?thisSpeed=undefined|title=In Pictures: The World's Most Corrupt Countries|accessdate=10 August 2010 | work=Forbes Magazine | date=25 June 2008}}</ref>\n\nTonga was ranked the 165th safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 [[Euromoney]] Country Risk rankings.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Euromoney Country Risk|url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe manufacturing sector consists of [[cottage industry|handicrafts]] and a few other very small scale industries, which contribute only about 3% of GDP. Commercial business activities also are inconspicuous and, to a large extent, are dominated by the same large trading companies found throughout the South Pacific. In September 1974, the country's first commercial trading bank, the Bank of Tonga, opened.\n\nTonga's development plans emphasise a growing private sector, upgrading agricultural productivity, revitalising the squash and vanilla bean industries, developing tourism, and improving communications and transport. Substantial progress has been made, but much work remains to be done. A small but growing construction sector is developing in response to the inflow of aid monies and remittances from Tongans abroad. In recognition of such a crucial contribution the present government has created a new department within the Prime Minister's Office with the sole purpose of catering for the needs of Tongans living abroad. Furthermore, in 2007 the Tongan Parliament amended citizenship laws to allow Tongans to hold dual citizenship.<ref name=\"b1\" />\n\n{{anchor|Tourism}}\nThe tourist industry is relatively undeveloped; however, the government recognises that tourism can play a major role in economic development, and efforts are being made to increase this source of revenue.

A number of islands lack a basic electricity supply, a supply entirely coming from imported diesel: in 2009, 19% of GDP and 25% of imports consisted of diesel.\n\nIn view of the decreasing reliability of [[fossil-fuel electricity]] generation, its increasing costs and negative environmental side-effects, [[renewable energy]] solutions have attracted the government's attention. Together with [[IRENA]], Tonga has charted out a renewable energy based strategy to power the main and outer islands alike. The strategy focuses on [[Solar Home System]]s that turn individual households into small power plants. In addition, it calls for the involvement of local operators, finance institutions and technicians to provide sustainable business models as well as strategies to ensure the effective operation, management and maintenance once the systems are installed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.irena.org |title=International Renewable Energy Agency |publisher=IRENA |date=26 January 2009 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nWith the assistance of IRENA, Tonga has developed the 2010\u20132020 Tonga Energy Road Map (TERM), which aims for a 50% reduction of diesel importation.

In 1928, Queen [[Salote Tupou III]], who was a member of the church, established the Free Wesleyan Church as the state religion of Tonga. The chief pastor of the Free Wesleyan Church serves as the representative of the people of Tonga and of the Church at the coronation of a King or Queen of Tonga where he anoints and crowns the Monarch. In opposition to the establishment of the Free Wesleyan Church as a state religion, the [[Church of Tonga]] separated from the Free Wesleyan Church in 1928.\n\nEveryday life is heavily influenced by Polynesian traditions and by the Christian faith; for example, all commerce and entertainment activities cease on Sunday, from the beginning of the day at midnight, to the end of the day at midnight.

Higher education includes teacher training, nursing and medical training, a small private university, a woman's business college, and a number of private agricultural schools. Most higher education is pursued overseas.\n\nTongans enjoy a relatively high level of education, with a 98.9% [[literacy]] rate,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/tn.html|title=Tonga|work=The World Factbook|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=22 June 2010}}</ref> and higher education up to and including medical and graduate degrees (pursued mostly overseas).\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main|Culture of Tonga}}\n[[File:Faikava.jpg|thumb|[[Kava culture]]]]\n\nHumans have lived in Tonga for nearly 3,000 years, since settlement in late [[Lapita]] times. Before the arrival of European explorers in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Tongans had frequent contacts with their nearest oceanic neighbours, [[Fiji]] and [[Niue]]. In the 19th century, with the arrival of Western traders and missionaries, Tongan culture changed, especially in religion. {{as of | 2013}}, almost 98&nbsp;percent of residents profess Christianity. The people discarded some old beliefs and habits and adopted others.\n\n[[File:Ula fu.jpg|thumb|The start of a Tongan [[tau\u02bbolunga]] dance]]\n\nContemporary Tongans often have strong ties to overseas lands. Many Tongans have emigrated to Australia, New Zealand, or the United States to seek employment and a higher standard of living. The United States is the preferred destination for Tongan emigrants, and as of 2000 there were 36,840 Tongans living in the US.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tongans Overseas: Between Two Shores|author=Helen Morton Lee|date=2003|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2615-4}}</ref> More than 8,000 Tongans live in Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/360/the-ties-that-bind-stories-from-the-tongan-diaspora/3131868|title = The ties that bind: stories from the Tongan diaspora|date = 2 May 2009 <!-- 2:05PM --> |accessdate = 29 December 2014|website = |publisher = ABC}}</ref> The Tongan [[diaspora]] retains close ties to relatives at home,{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} and a significant portion of Tonga's income derives from remittances{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} to family members (often aged) who prefer to remain in Tonga.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{Further|Sport in Tonga}}\n\n====Rugby====\n\n[[Rugby union]] is the national sport,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualoceania.net/tonga/culture/sport.shtml|title=Tonga Sport|work=Virtual Oceania|date=26 February 2015}}</ref> and the [[Tonga national rugby union team|national team]] (\u02bbIkale Tahi, or Sea Eagles) has performed quite well on the international stage. Tonga has competed in six [[Rugby World Cup]]s since [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]]. The [[2007 Rugby World Cup|2007]] and [[2011 Rugby World Cup]]s were Tonga's most successful to date, both winning two out of four matches and in a running chance for the quarter finals. In the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]], Tonga won its first two matches, against the [[United States national rugby union team|USA]] 25\u201315, and [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] 19\u201315. They came very close to upsetting the eventual winners of the 2007 tournament, the South African [[Springboks]], losing 30\u201325. A loss to [[England National Rugby Union Team|England]], 36\u201320 in their last pool game ended their hopes of making the knockout stages. Nevertheless, by picking up third place in their pool games behind South Africa and England, Tonga earned automatic qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. In [[2011 Rugby World Cup Pool A|Pool A]] of the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]], Tonga beat both [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]] 31\u201318 and 5th ranked<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/teams/team=42/index.html/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107015727/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/home/teams/team=42/index.html/|title=Official RWC 2011 Site|archivedate=7 January 2012|work=rugbyworldcup.com}}</ref> eventual finalist [[France national rugby union team|France]] 19\u201314 in the latter pool stages. However, a previous heavy defeat to the [[All Blacks]] at the tournament's opener (41\u201310) and a subsequent tight loss to [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]] (25\u201320) meant that Tonga lost out to France (who also lost to [[All Blacks|NZ]]) for the quarter finals due to 2 bonus points and a points difference of 46.\n\nTonga's best result before 2007 came in [[1995 Rugby World Cup|1995]], when they beat [[Ivory Coast national rugby union team|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]] 29\u201311, and [[1999 Rugby World Cup|1999]] when they beat Italy 28\u201325 (although with only 14 men they lost heavily to England, 101\u201310). Tonga perform the [[Kailao|Ikale Tahi war dance]] or Sipi Tau (a form of [[Kailao]]) before all their matches. Tonga used to compete in the [[Pacific Tri-Nations]] against Samoa and Fiji, which has now been replaced by the [[IRB Pacific Nations Cup]], which now involves [[Japan national rugby union team|Japan]], [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], and the [[United States national rugby union team|United States]]. At club level, there are the [[Datec Cup Provincial Championship]] and the [[Pacific Rugby Cup]]. Rugby union is governed by the [[Tonga Rugby Football Union]], which was a member of the [[Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance]] and contributed to the [[Pacific Islanders rugby union team]], before they were disbanded in 2009.\n\nMany players of Tongan descent \u2013 e.g., [[Jonah Lomu]], [[Israel Folau]], [[Viliami Ofahengaue|Viliami \"William\" \u02bbOfahengaue]], [[Malakai Fekitoa]], [[Ben Afeaki]], [[Charles Piutau]], [[Frank Halai]], [[Sekope Kepu]], [[George Smith (rugby union)|George Smith]], [[Cliff Palu|Wycliff Palu]], [[Sitaleki Timani]], [[Salesi Ma'afu]], [[Anthony Faingaa|Anthony]] and [[Saia Faingaa]], [[Mark Gerrard]], [[Cooper Vuna]], [[Doug Howlett]], [[Toutai Kefu]] and [[Tatafu Polota-Nau]] \u2013 have played for either the All Blacks or the Wallabies. [[British and Irish Lions|British and Irish Lion]] and Welsh international player [[Taulupe Faletau|Taulupe \"Toby\" Faletau]] is Tongan born and the son of Tongan international [[Kuli Faletau]]. Taulupe's cousins and England international players [[Billy Vunipola|Billy]] and [[Mako Vunipola]] (who is also a [[British and Irish Lion]]), are sons of former Tonga rugby captain [[Fe'ao Vunipola]]. Rugby is popular among the nation's schools, and students from schools such as Tonga College and [[Tupou College]] are regularly offered scholarships in New Zealand, Australia and Japan.\n\n[[Rugby league]] has gained some success. In the [[2008 Rugby League World Cup]] [[Tonga national rugby league team|Tonga]] recorded wins against [[Ireland national rugby league team|Ireland]] and [[Scotland national rugby league team|Scotland]]. In the 2017 World Cup, the Tonga side beat New Zealand in Hamilton at Waikato Stadium on 11 November. In doing so, Tonga became the first national side in the history of the sport (outside of the big three nations of Australia, New Zealand and England/Great Britain) to beat one of the big three nations. In addition to the success of the national team, many players of Tongan descent make it big in the Australian [[National Rugby League]] competition. These include [[Willie Mason]], [[Manu Vatuvei]], [[Brent Kite]], [[Willie Tonga]], [[Anthony Tupou]], [[Antonio Kaufusi]], [[Israel Folau]], [[Taniela Tuiaki]], [[Michael Jennings (rugby league)|Michael Jennings]], [[Tony Williams (rugby league)|Tony Williams]], [[Feleti Mateo]], [[Fetuli Talanoa]], to name a few. Subsequently, some Tongan rugby league players have established successful careers in the [[Super League]] such as Antonio Kaufusi.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://superleague.co.uk/article.php?id=12004 |title= Superleague |date= 8 October 2008 |publisher= Superleague |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120406012927/http://superleague.co.uk/article.php?id=12004 |archivedate= 6 April 2012 |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==== Olympics ====\n{{Main|Tonga at the Olympics}}\n\nAside from rugby, Tonga has also produced athletes who have competed at both the Summer and Winter Olympics. Tonga's only Olympic medal came from the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta, where [[Paea Wolfgramm]] won silver in [[Boxing at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Super heavyweight|Super heavyweight]] boxing. One athlete attended the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in Pyeongchang, South Korea.\n\n=== Media ===\n* ''Matangi Tonga''&nbsp;\u2013 online newspaper\n* ''[[Times of Tonga|Taimi o Tonga]]'' (''Times of Tonga'')&nbsp;\u2013 controversial newspaper\n* ''Kele\u02bba''&nbsp;\u2013 newspaper\n* ''Talaki''&nbsp;\u2013 newspaper\n* ''[[Tonga Chronicle|Kalonikali]]''&nbsp;\u2013 newspaper\n* ''Tau\u02bbataina''&nbsp;\u2013 newspaper\n* ''Kakalu''&nbsp;\u2013 newspaper\n* [[Tonga Broadcasting Commission]] ([[Television Tonga]], [[Television Tonga 2]], [[Radio Tonga]] 1, [[Radio Tonga]] 2 \u2013 Kool 90FM, [[Radio Tonga|103FM]])\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Oceania}}\n*[[List of Tonga-related topics]]\n* [[Outline of Tonga]]{{clear}}\n\n== References ==\n<!-- Journal of World Prehistory 12 (3): 337\u2013392 -->\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n;Ethnography, culture and history\n* ''On the Edge of the Global: Modern Anxieties in a Pacific Island Nation'' (2011) by Niko Besnier.

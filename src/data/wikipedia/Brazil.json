Then in the 20th century especially in Brasilia, Brazil experimented with [[Modernist architecture]].\n\nThe colonial architecture of Brazil dates to the early 16th century when Brazil was first explored, conquered and settled by the Portuguese. The Portuguese built architecture familiar to them in Europe in their aim to colonise Brazil. They built Portuguese colonial architecture which included Churches, civic architecture including houses and forts in Brazilian cities and the countryside. During 19th Century Brazilian architecture saw the introduction of more European styles to Brazil such as Neoclassical and Gothic Revival architecture. This was usually mixed with Brazilian influences from their own heritage which produced a unique form of Brazilian architecture. In the 1950s the [[modernist architecture]] was introduced when [[Brasilia]] was built as new federal capital in the interior of Brazil to help develop the interior. The architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]] idealized and built Government buildings, Churches and civic buildings was constructed in the modernist style.<ref name=\"Guimaraens\">Guimaraens, C\u00ea\u00e7a de.

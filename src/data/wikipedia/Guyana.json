It is often considered part of the [[Caribbean|Caribbean region]] because of its strong cultural, historical, and political ties with other [[British West Indies|Anglo-Caribbean]] countries and the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM). Guyana is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the north, [[Brazil]] to the south and southwest, [[Venezuela]] to the west, and [[Suriname]] to the east. With an area of {{convert|215000|sqkm|sqmi}}, Guyana is the third-smallest [[sovereign state]] on mainland South America after [[Uruguay]] and [[Suriname]].\n\nThe region known as \"[[the Guianas]]\" consists of the [[Guiana Shield|large shield landmass]] north of the [[Amazon River]] and east of the [[Orinoco|Orinoco River]] known as the \"land of many waters\". Major rivers in Guyana include the [[Essequibo River|Essequibo]], the [[Berbice River|Berbice]], and the [[Demerara River|Demerara]].  Originally inhabited by many indigenous groups, Guyana was settled by the Dutch before coming under [[British Empire|British control]] in the late 18th century. It was governed as [[British Guiana]], with a mostly plantation-style economy until the 1950s. It gained independence in 1966, and officially became a republic within the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] in 1970. The legacy of British rule is reflected in the country's political administration and diverse population, which includes [[Indo-Guyanese|Indian]], African, Amerindian, and multiracial groups.\n\nGuyana is the only South American nation in which English is the official language. The majority of the population, however, speak [[Guyanese Creole]], an [[English-based creole language]], as a first language. Guyana is part of the [[Anglophone Caribbean]]. CARICOM, of which Guyana is a member, is [[Secretariat (administrative office)|headquartered]] in Guyana's capital and largest city, [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]]. In 2008, the country joined the [[Union of South American Nations]] as a founding member.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Guyana\" derives from ''Guiana'', the original name for the region that formerly included Guyana (British Guiana), Suriname ([[Dutch colonization of the Guianas|Dutch Guiana]]), French Guiana, and parts of [[Colombia]], Venezuela and Brazil. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', \"Guyana\" comes from an indigenous Amerindian language and means \"land of many waters\".<ref>\n{{cite web | url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Guyana | title= Guyana | publisher= Oxford Dictionaries | accessdate= 9 May 2015 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150707214123/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Guyana | archive-date= 7 July 2015 | dead-url= no | df= dmy-all }}\n</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Guyana}}\n[[File:LocationNetherlandsGuiana.png|thumb|left|A map of Dutch Guiana 1667\u20131814]]\n\nThere are nine [[Indigenous peoples in Guyana|indigenous]] tribes residing in Guyana: the [[Wai-wai people|Wai Wai]], [[Macushi people|Macushi]], [[Patamona people|Patamona]], [[Lokono]], [[Kalina people|Kalina]], [[Wapishana people|Wapishana]], [[Pemon people|Pemon]], [[Akawaio people|Akawaio]] and [[Warao people|Warao]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html |title=Ministry of Amerindian Affairs \u2013 Georgetown, Guyana |publisher=Amerindian.gov.gy |date= |accessdate=30 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602173603/http://www.amerindian.gov.gy/discover/tribes/index.html |archivedate=2 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Historically the Lokono and Kalina tribes dominated Guyana. Although [[Christopher Columbus]] was the first European to sight Guyana during his third voyage (in 1498), and Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] wrote an account in 1596, the Dutch were the first Europeans to establish colonies: [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] (1616), [[Berbice]] (1627), and [[Demerara]] (1752).

In 1831 the three separate colonies became a single British colony known as [[British Guiana]].\n\n[[File:Boundary lines of British Guiana 1896.jpg|thumb|Map of [[British Guiana]] from 1896.]]\nSince its independence in 1824 Venezuela has claimed the area of land to the west of the [[Essequibo River]]. [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] wrote to the British government warning against the Berbice and Demerara settlers settling on land which the Venezuelans, as assumed heirs of Spanish claims on the area dating to the sixteenth century, claimed was theirs. In 1899 an international tribunal ruled the land belonged to Great Britain. The British territorial claim stemmed from Dutch involvement and colonization of the area also dating to the sixteenth century, which was ceded to the British.\n\nGuyana achieved independence from the United Kingdom on 26 May 1966 and became a republic on 23 February 1970, remaining a member of the Commonwealth. The [[United States Department of State|US State Department]] and the US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), along with the British government, played a strong role in influencing political control in Guyana during this time.<ref>[http://www.guyana.org/govt/US-declassifed-documents-1964-1968.html US Declassified Documents (1964\u20131968)]. guyana.org {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212125256/http://www.guyana.org/govt/US-declassifed-documents-1964-1968.html |date=12 February 2007 }}</ref> The American government supported [[Forbes Burnham]] during the early years of independence because [[Cheddi Jagan]] was identified as a [[Marxist]]. They provided secret financial support and political campaign advice to Burnham's [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|People's National Congress]], to the detriment of the Jagan-led [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]], which was mostly supported by Guyanese of East Indian background.\n\nIn 1978, Guyana received international notice when 918 members of the American cult, [[Peoples Temple]], died in a mass murder/suicide drinking cyanide-laced [[Flavor Aid]]. However, most of the suicides were by Americans and not Guyanese. More than 300 children were killed; the people were members of a group led by [[Jim Jones]] in [[Jonestown]], the settlement which they had created. Jim Jones's bodyguards had earlier attacked people taking off at a small remote airstrip close to Jonestown, killing five people, including [[Leo Ryan]], a US [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]].\n\nIn May 2008, President [[Bharrat Jagdeo]] was a signatory to the [[UNASUR Constitutive Treaty]] of the Union of South American Nations. Guyana has ratified the treaty.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Main|Geography of Guyana}}\n[[File:Rupununi Savannah.jpg|thumb|[[Rupununi Savannah]]]]\n\nThe territory controlled by Guyana lies between latitudes [[1st parallel north|1\u00b0]] and [[9th parallel north|9\u00b0N]], and longitudes [[56th meridian west|56\u00b0]] and [[62nd meridian west|62\u00b0W]].\n\nThe country can be divided into five natural regions; a narrow and fertile marshy plain along the Atlantic coast (low coastal plain) where most of the population lives; a white sand belt more inland (hilly sand and clay region), containing most of Guyana's mineral deposits; the dense [[rain forest]]s (Forested Highland Region) in the southern part of the country; the dryer [[savannah]] areas in the south-west; and the smallest interior lowlands (interior savannah) consisting mostly of mountains that gradually rise to the Brazilian border.\n\nSome of Guyana's highest mountains are [[Mount Ayanganna]] ({{convert|2042|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), [[Monte Cabura\u00ed]] ({{convert|1465|m|ft|0|disp=or}}) and [[Mount Roraima]] ({{convert|2772|m|ft|0|disp=or}} \u2013 the highest mountain in Guyana) on the Brazil-Guyana-Venezuela [[tripoint]] border, part of the [[Pakaraima]] range. Mount Roraima and Guyana's table-top mountains ([[tepui]]s) are said to have been the inspiration for [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 novel ''[[The Lost World (Arthur Conan Doyle)|The Lost World]]''. There are also many volcanic [[escarpment]]s and waterfalls, including [[Kaieteur Falls]] which is believed to be the largest water drop in the world.<ref name=independent>{{cite news|title= South America: Do the continental: The best of what's new; spectacular waterfalls, forgotten cities, pre-Inca trails |work = The Independent |date=14 November 2004 |page = Features, page 3 |first = Mark |last = Rowe }}</ref> North of the [[Rupununi River]] lies the [[Rupununi savannah]], south of which lie the [[Kanuku Mountains]].\n\nThe four longest rivers are the Essequibo at {{convert|1010|km|mi|0}} long, the [[Courentyne River]] at {{convert|724|km|mi|0}}, the [[Berbice River|Berbice]] at {{convert|595|km|mi|0}}, and the [[Demerara River|Demerara]] at {{convert|346|km|mi|0}}. The Corentyne river forms the border with Suriname. At the mouth of the Essequibo are several large islands, including the {{convert|145|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} wide [[Shell Beach, Guyana|Shell Beach]] lies along the northwest coast, which is also a major breeding area for [[sea turtle]]s (mainly [[leatherback sea turtle|leatherbacks]]) and other wildlife.\n\nThe local climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]] and generally hot and humid, though moderated by northeast [[trade winds]] along the coast. There are two rainy seasons, the first from May to mid-August, the second from mid-November to mid-January.\n\nGuyana has one of the largest unspoiled [[rainforest]]s in South America, some parts of which are almost inaccessible by humans. The rich natural history of Guyana was described by early explorers [[Walter Raleigh|Sir Walter Raleigh]] and [[Charles Waterton]] and later by naturalists Sir [[David Attenborough]] and [[Gerald Durrell]]. In 2008, the [[BBC]] broadcast a three-part programme called ''Lost Land of the Jaguar'' which highlighted the huge diversity of wildlife, including undiscovered species and rare species such as the [[giant otter]] and [[harpy eagle]].\n\nIn 2012, Guyana received a $45 million reward from Norway for its rainforest protection efforts. This stems from a 2009 agreement between the nations for a total of $250 million for protecting and maintaining the natural habitat. Thus far, the country has received $115 million of the total grant.\n\n=== Regions and Neighbourhood Councils === <!--Linked from [[Administrative divisions of Guyana]]-->\n{{Main|Regions of Guyana|Neighbourhood Councils of Guyana}}\nGuyana is divided into 10 regions:<ref>[http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/Chapter3_Population_Redistribution_Internal_Migration.pdf Bureau of Statistics \u2013 Guyana] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANd8NvxO?url=http://www.statisticsguyana.gov.gy/pubs/Chapter3_Population_Redistribution_Internal_Migration.pdf |date=2 September 2012 }}, CHAPTER III: POPULATION REDISTRIBUTION AND INTERNAL MIGRATION, Table 3.4: Population Density, Guyana: 1980\u20132002</ref><ref>[http://gina.gov.gy/natprofile/gnprof.html Guyana \u2013 Government Information Agency], National Profile. gina.gov.gy {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814020614/http://gina.gov.gy/natprofile/gnprof.html |date=14 August 2007 }}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:right\"\n|- style=\"background:#bbb;\"\n!

Venezuela did not agree with this as it claimed all lands west of the Essequibo River. In 1898, at Venezuela's request, an international [[Arbitral tribunal|arbitration tribunal]] was convened, and in 1899 the tribunal issued an award giving about 94% of the disputed territory to British Guiana. The arbitration was concluded, settled and accepted into International law by both Venezuela and the U.K. Venezuela brought up again the settled claim, during the 1960s cold war period, and during Guyana's Independence period.

In 1967 a Surinamese survey team was found in the New River Triangle and was forcibly removed. In August 1969 a patrol of the [[Guyana Defence Force]] found a survey camp and a partially completed airstrip inside the triangle, and documented evidence of the Surinamese intention to occupy the entire disputed area. After an exchange of gunfire, the [[Surinamese]] were driven from the triangle.\n\n=== Environment and biodiversity ===\n{{See also|Category:Flora of Guyana|Category:Fauna of Guyana|Category:Orchids_of_Guyana}}\n[[File:Guyana BMNG.png|thumb|upright|Satellite image of Guyana from 2004]]\n[[File:Golden frog Kaieteur (2).jpg|thumb|''Anomaloglossus beebei'' (Kaieteur), specific to the Guianas]]\n[[File:Rurrenabaque Bolivia - The Amazon.jpg|thumb|The [[hoatzin]] is the national bird of Guyana.]]\n\nThe following habitats have been categorised for Guyana: coastal, marine, littoral, estuarine palustrine, mangrove, riverine, lacustrine, swamp, savanna, white sand forest, brown sand forest, montane, cloud forest, moist lowland and dry evergreen scrub forests (NBAP, 1999). About 14 areas of biological interest have been identified as possible hotspots for a National Protected Area System.\nMore than 80% of Guyana is still covered by forests, those forest also contains the worlds rarest [[orchids]] ranging from dry evergreen and seasonal forests to montane and lowland evergreen rain forests. These forests are home to more than a thousand species of trees. Guyana's tropical climate, unique geology, and relatively pristine ecosystems support extensive areas of species-rich rain forests and natural habitats with high levels of [[endemism]]. Approximately eight thousand species of plants occur in Guyana, half of which are found nowhere else.\n\nGuyana has one of the highest levels of [[biodiversity]] in the world. With 1,168 [[vertebrate]] species and 814 bird species, it boasts one of the richest mammalian fauna assemblages of any comparably sized area in the world. The Guiana Shield region is little known and extremely rich biologically. Unlike other areas of South America, over 70% of the natural habitat remains pristine.\n\nThe rich natural history of British Guiana was described by early explorers Sir Walter Raleigh and Charles Waterton and later by naturalists Sir David Attenborough and Gerald Durrell.\n\nIn February 2004, the Government of Guyana issued a title to more than {{convert|1|e6acre|km2}} of land in the Konashen Indigenous District declaring this land as the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area (COCA), to be managed by the [[Wai-Wai (people)|Wai Wai]]. In doing so Guyana created the world's largest Community-Owned Conservation Area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conservation.org/Documents/CI_Konashen_COCA_Biodiversity_Booklet.pdf |title=Biodiversity in the Konashen Community-Owned Conservation Area, Guyana |format=PDF |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206142519/http://www.conservation.org/Documents/CI_Konashen_COCA_Biodiversity_Booklet.pdf |archivedate=6 December 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThis important event followed a request made by the Wai Wai community to the government of Guyana and Conservation International Guyana (CIG) for assistance in developing a sustainable plan for their lands in Konashen. The three parties signed a Memorandum of Cooperation which outlines a plan for sustainable use of the Konashen COCA's biological resources, identifies threats to the area's biodiversity, and helps develop projects to increase awareness of the COCA as well as generate the income necessary to maintain its protected status.\n\nThe Konashen Indigenous District of Southern Guyana houses the headwaters of the Essequibo River, Guyana's principal water source, and drains the Kassikaityu, Kamoa, Sipu and Chodikar rivers. Southern Guyana is host to some of the most pristine expanses of evergreen forests in the northern part of South America. Most of the forests found here are tall, evergreen hill-land and lower montane forests, with large expanses of flooded forest along major rivers. Thanks to the very low human population density of the area, most of these forests are still intact. The Smithsonian Institution has identified nearly 2,700 species of plants from this region, representing 239 distinct families, and there are certainly additional species still to be recorded.\n\nThe diversity of plants supports diverse animal life, recently documented by a biological survey organised by Conservation International. The reportedly clean, unpolluted waters of the Essequibo watershed support a remarkable diversity of fish and aquatic invertebrates, and are home to [[giant otters]], [[capybaras]], and several species of [[caimans]].\n\nOn land, large mammals, such as [[jaguar]]s, [[tapirs]], [[bush dog]]s, [[giant anteater]]s, and [[saki monkey]]s are still common. Over 400 species of birds have been reported from the region, and the reptile and amphibian faunas are similarly rich. The Konashen COCA forests are also home to countless species of insects, arachnids, and other invertebrates, many of which are still undiscovered or unnamed.\n\nThe Konashen COCA contains a high level of biological diversity and richness that remains in nearly pristine condition; such places have become rare on earth. This fact has given rise to various non-exploitative, environmentally sustainable industries such as ecotourism, successfully capitalising on the biological wealth of the Konashen COCA with comparatively little enduring impact.\n\n=== World Heritage sites ===\n[[File:GuyanaKaieteurFalls2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kaieteur Falls]] is the world's largest single-drop waterfall by volume.]]\n\nGuyana signed the [[Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage#Convention and background|Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage]] treaty in 1977, the first Caribbean country to do so. In the mid-1990s, Guyana began the process of selecting sites for World Heritage nomination, and three sites were considered: [[Kaieteur National Park]], Shell Beach and Historic Georgetown. By 1997, work on Kaieteur National Park was started, and in 1998 work on Historic Georgetown was begun. To date, however, Guyana has not made a successful nomination.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuyana submitted the Kaieteur National Park, including the [[Kaieteur Falls]], to UNESCO as its first World Heritage Site nomination. The proposed area and surrounds have some of Guyana's most diversified life zones with one of the highest levels of [[endemic]] species found in South America. The Kaieteur Falls are the most spectacular feature of the park, falling a distance of 226&nbsp;metres. The nomination of Kaieteur National Park as a World Heritage Site was not successful, primarily because the area was seen by the evaluators as being too small, especially when compared with the Central Suriname Nature Reserve that had just been nominated as a World Heritage Site (2000). The dossier was thus returned to Guyana for revision.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuyana continues in its bid for a World Heritage Site. Work continues, after a period of hiatus, on the nomination dossier for Historic Georgetown. A tentative list indicating an intention to nominate Historic Georgetown was submitted to UNESCO in December 2004. In April 2005, two Dutch experts in conservation spent two weeks in Georgetown supervising architecture staff and students of the [[University of Guyana]] in a historic building survey of the selected area. This is part of the data collection for the nomination dossier.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nMeanwhile, as a result of the Kaieteur National Park being considered too small, there is a proposal to prepare a nomination for a Cluster Site that will include the Kaieteur National Park, the [[Iwokrama Forest]] and the Kanuku Mountains. The Iwokrama rain forest, an area rich in biological diversity, has been described by Major General (Retired) Joseph Singh as \"a flagship project for conservation.\" The Kanuku Mountains area is in a pristine state and is home to more than four hundred species of birds and other animals. {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nGuyana holds two of the [[World Wildlife Fund]]'s [[Global 200]] eco-regions,{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} the Guianan and [[Guiana Highlands]] moist forests. It is also home to several endemic species including the [[Chlorocardium|greenheart]] tree.\n\n=== Landmarks ===\n[[File:St georges.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St George's Cathedral, Georgetown]]]]\n\n; St George's Anglican Cathedral: A historic Anglican Cathedral made of wood.\n; [[Demerara Harbour Bridge]]: The world's fourth-longest floating bridge.\n; [[Berbice Bridge]]: The world's sixth-longest floating bridge.\n; [[Secretariat of the Caribbean Community|Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Building]]: Houses the headquarters of the largest and most powerful economic union in the Caribbean.\n; [[Providence Stadium]]: Situated on Providence on the north bank of the Demerara River and built in time for the ICC World Cup 2007, it is the largest sports stadium in the country.

The sugar industry, which accounts for 28% of all export earnings, is largely run by the company [[GuySuCo]], which employs more people than any other industry. Many industries have a large foreign investment. For example, the American company [[Reynolds Metals]] and the British-Australian [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto's]] Rio Tinto Alcan subsidiary are heavily invested in Guyana's mineral industry; the Korean/Malaysian Barama Company has a large stake in the logging industry. Since 2015, foreign companies have made several significant deep water [[Petroleum exploration in Guyana|oil discoveries]].\n\nChronic problems include a shortage of skilled [[labour (economics)|labour]], deficient infrastructure, and until recently, sizable external debt. Low prices for key mining and agricultural commodities, combined with troubles in the bauxite and sugar industries, had threatened the government's tenuous fiscal position and dimmed prospects for the future. However, the Guyanese economy has rebounded slightly and exhibited moderate economic growth since 1999, thanks to an expansion in the agricultural and mining sectors, a more favourable atmosphere for business initiatives, a more realistic exchange rate, fairly low inflation, and the continued support of international organisations. In 2008, the economy witnessed a 3% increase in growth amid the global [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|economic crisis]]. It grew 5.4% in 2011 and 3.7% in 2012.\n\nThe production of [[balat\u00e1]] (natural [[latex]]) was once big business in Guyana. Most of the balata bleeding in Guyana took place in the foothills of the Kanuku Mountains in the Rupununi. Early exploitation also took place in the North West District, but most of the trees in the area were destroyed by illicit bleeding methods that involved cutting down the trees rather than making incisions in them. Uses of balat\u00e1 included the making of [[cricket]] balls, the temporary filling of troublesome tooth cavities, and the crafting of figurines and other decorative items (particularly by the Macushi people of the Kanuku mountains).\n\nMajor [[private sector]] organisations include the Private Sector Commission (PSC)<ref>{{cite web |author=RedSpider, Romona Khan |url=http://www.psc.org.gy |title=Private Sector Commission |publisher=Psc.org.gy |accessdate=2 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628041741/http://www.psc.org.gy/ |archive-date=28 June 2010 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and the Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgetownchamberofcommerce.org |title=Georgetown Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) |publisher=Georgetownchamberofcommerce.org |accessdate=2 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217153022/http://www.georgetownchamberofcommerce.org/ |archivedate=17 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe government initiated a major overhaul of the tax code in early 2007. A [[Value Added Tax]] (VAT) replaced six different taxes. Prior to the implementation of the VAT, it had been relatively easy to evade sales tax, and many businesses were in violation of tax code. Many businesses opposed VAT introduction because of the extra paperwork required; however, the Government has remained firm on the VAT. By replacing several taxes with one flat tax rate, it will also be easier for government auditors to spot [[embezzlement]]. This was prevalent under the former PPP/C government who authorised the VAT to be equal to 50% of the value of the good.\n\nPresident Bharrat Jagdeo had made [[debt relief]] a priority. He convinced the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank Group|the World Bank]] and the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] (IDB) to write off US$800&nbsp;million of debt, and millions more owed to industrial nations. Jagdeo was lauded by IDB President Moreno for his strong leadership and negotiating skills.\n\n=== Summary ===\n[[File:Guyana's splenders.jpg|thumb|[[Thatched roof]] houses in Guyana]]\n{{Columns\n|style=\"width:500px;\" |gap=20px\n|col1 =\n;

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the President and the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the President and the [[National Assembly of Guyana]]. Historically, politics are a source of tension in the country, and violent riots have often broken out during elections. During the 1970s and 1980s, the political landscape was dominated by the People's National Congress.\n\nIn 1992, the first \"free and fair\" elections were overseen by former United States President [[Jimmy Carter]], and the People's Progressive Party led the country until 2015. The two parties are principally organised along ethnic lines and as a result often clash on issues related to the allocation of resources. In the General Elections held on 28 November 2011, the People's Progressive Party (PPP) retained a majority, and their presidential candidate [[Donald Ramotar]] was elected as President.\n\nOn 11 May 2015, early general elections were held. A coalition of the A Partnership for National Unity-Alliance for Change (APNU-AFC) parties won 33 of the 65 seats in the National Assembly. On 16 May 2015, retired army general [[David A. Granger]] became the eighth President of Guyana. However, on 21 December 2018, a vote of confidence was called for, regarding terms under which the government granted a franchise for offshore oil exploration. Legislator Charrandass Persaud defected from the coalition and the vote failed, requiring new elections. The governing coalition litigated this result for the entire 90 days allowed for new elections.<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://guyanachronicle.com/2019/03/21/ruling-on-confidence-vote-appeal-friday\n|title=Ruling on confidence vote appeal Friday\n|author=Svetlana Marshall\n|publisher=Guyana Chronicle\n|date=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Public procurement ===\n[[Government procurement|Public procurement]] in Guyana is overseen by the Public Procurement Commission, appointed under the Public Procurement Commission Act 2003.

Guyana is a founding member of the [[Caricom]] (Caribbean Community) economic bloc and also the home of the Bloc's Headquarters, the CARICOM Secretariat.\n\nGuyana's geographical location, its sparsely populated rain-forest regions, and its substantial Amerindian population differentiate it from English-speaking Caribbean countries. Its blend of Indo-Guyanese (East Indian) and Afro-Guyanese (African) cultures gives it similarities to [[Trinidad]] and distinguishes it from other parts of the Americas. Guyana shares similar interests with the islands in the West Indies, such as food, festive events, music, sports, etc.\n\nGuyana plays international cricket as a part of the [[West Indian cricket team|West Indies cricket team]], and the [[Guyanese cricket team|Guyana team]] plays [[first class cricket|first-class cricket]] against other nations of the Caribbean. In March and April 2007 Guyana co-hosted the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]]. In addition to its CARICOM membership, Guyana is a member of [[CONCACAF]], the international football federation for North and Central America and the Caribbean.\n\nEvents include [[Mashramani]] (Mash), [[Phagwah]] ([[Holi]]), and [[Deepavali]] ([[Diwali]]).\n\n== Wildlife ==\nAmong the birds found on Guyana is cock of the rock (''[[Rupicola rupicola]]'').<ref>Attenborough, S. 1998 BBC.

The major reasons include the long history of British policy preference toward developing the Arab north and its ignoring the Black south. After Sudan's first independent elections in 1958, the continued ignoring of the south by [[Khartoum]] (lack of schools, roads, bridges) led to uprisings, revolt, and the longest civil war on the continent.<ref>Matthew LeRiche, Matthew Arnold.

Surveys have revealed that [[Boma National Park]], west of the Ethiopian border, as well as the [[Sudd]] wetland and [[Southern National Park]] near the border with Congo, provided habitat for large populations of [[hartebeest]], [[kob]], [[topi]], [[African buffalo|buffalo]], elephants, giraffes, and lions.\n\nSouth Sudan's forest reserves also provided habitat for [[Bongo (antelope)|bongo]], [[giant forest hog]]s, [[red river hog]]s, forest elephants, [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzees]], and forest [[monkeys]]. Surveys begun in 2005 by [[Wildlife Conservation Society|WCS]] in partnership with the semi-autonomous government of Southern Sudan revealed that significant, though diminished wildlife populations still exist, and that, astonishingly, the huge migration of 1.3&nbsp;million antelopes in the southeast is substantially intact.\n\nHabitats in the country include grasslands, high-altitude plateaus and escarpments, wooded and grassy savannas, floodplains, and wetlands. Associated wildlife species include the endemic white-eared kob and [[Nile Lechwe]], as well as elephants, giraffes, [[common eland]], [[giant eland]], [[oryx]], lions, [[Lycaon pictus|African wild dogs]], cape buffalo, and topi (locally called tiang). Little is known about the white-eared kob and tiang, both types of [[antelope]], whose magnificent migrations were legendary before the civil war. The Boma-Jonglei Landscape region encompasses Boma National Park, broad pasturelands and floodplains, Bandingilo National Park, and the Sudd, a vast area of swamp and seasonally flooded grasslands that includes the Zeraf Wildlife Reserve.\n\nLittle is known of the fungi of South Sudan. A list of fungi in Sudan was prepared by S.A.J. Tarr and published by the then Commonwealth Mycological Institute (Kew, Surrey, UK) in 1955. The list, of 383 species in 175 genera, included all fungi observed within the then boundaries of the country. Many of those records relate to what is now South Sudan. Most of the species recorded were associated with diseases of crops. The true number of species of fungi in South Sudan is probably much higher.\n\nIn 2006, President Kiir announced that his government would do everything possible to protect and propagate South Sudanese fauna and flora, and seek to reduce the effects of wildfires, waste dumping, and water pollution. The environment is threatened by the development of the economy and infrastructure.\n\nSeveral [[ecoregion]]s extend across South Sudan: the [[East Sudanian savanna]], [[Northern Congolian forest-savanna mosaic]], [[Saharan flooded grasslands]] (Sudd), [[Sahelian Acacia savanna]], [[East African montane forests]], and the Northern [[Acacia]]-[[Commiphora]] [[bushland]]s and thickets.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Neil|first2=Jennifer |last2=D'Amico Hales|first3= Emma |last3=Underwood|year=2004|title= Terrestrial Ecoregions of Africa and Madagascar: A Conservation Assessment|publisher= Island Press|place= Washington DC|isbn=978-1-55963-364-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[File:South Sudan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|South Sudan map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nSouth Sudan has a climate similar to an Equatorial or tropical climate, characterized by a rainy season of high humidity and large amounts of rainfall followed by a drier season. The temperature on average is always high with July being the coolest month with an average temperatures falling between {{convert|68|and|86|F|C|order=flip}} and March being the warmest month with average temperatures ranging from {{convert|73|to|98|F|C|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web |url =http://www.weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,Juba,Sudan |title=Average weather in Juba, Sudan|work=weather-and-climate.com}}</ref>\n\nThe most rainfall is seen between May and October, but the rainy season can commence in April and extend until November. On average May is the wettest month. The season is \"influenced by the annual shift of the Inter-Tropical Zone\"<ref name=\"factbook\" /> and the shift to southerly and southwesterly winds leading to slightly lower temperatures, higher humidity, and more cloud coverage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/373303 |title=Weather: Juba |publisher=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of South Sudan}}\nSouth Sudan has a population of approximately {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|South Sudan}}|R}}/1e6 round 0}} million{{UN_Population|ref}} (UN estimate, the exact figure is disputed) and a predominantly rural, subsistence economy. This region has been negatively affected by war for all but 10 of the years since 1956, resulting in serious neglect, lack of [[infrastructure]] development, and major destruction and displacement. More than 2 million people have died, and more than 4 million are [[internally displaced person]]s or became [[refugee]]s as a result of the civil war and its impact.\n\n=== Urbanization ===\n[[File:John Garang Mausoleum Square in Juba.JPG|thumb|left|John Garang Square in Juba]]\n{{Largest cities of South Sudan}}\n[[File:Children in Yambio, Western Equatoria, South Sudan (28 05 2009).jpg|thumb|Children in Yambio, Western Equatoria, South Sudan]]\n[[File:USAID-funded Southern Sudan Interactive Radio Instruction project.jpg|thumb|Rural school children participating in the [[USAID]]-funded Southern Sudan Interactive Radio Instruction project, July 2010]]\n\n=== Ethnic groups ===\nThe major [[ethnic group]]s present in South Sudan are the [[Dinka people|Dinka]] at more than 1 million (approximately 15 percent combined), the [[Nuer people|Nuer]] (approximately ten percent), the [[Bari people|Bari]], and the [[Azande]]. The [[Shilluk people|Shilluk]] constitute a historically influential state along the White Nile, and their language is fairly closely related to Dinka and Nuer. The traditional territories of the Shilluk and the Northeastern Dinka are adjacent.\n\n=== Education ===\n{{Main|Education in South Sudan}}\nUnlike the previous educational system of the regional Southern Sudan\u2014which was modelled after the system used in the Republic of Sudan since 1990\u2014the current educational system of the Republic of South Sudan follows the {{nowrap|8 + 4 + 4}} system (similar to Kenya). Primary education consists of eight years, followed by four years of [[secondary education]], and then four years of university instruction.\n\nThe primary language at all levels is English, as compared to the Republic of Sudan, where the [[language of instruction]] is [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]]. In 2007 South Sudan adopted English as the [[official language]] of communication.

It is estimated that between 50% and 60% of the population of South Sudan has access to an improved water source, such as a hand pump, a protected well or&nbsp;\u2013 for a small minority&nbsp;\u2013 piped water supply. Although the [[White Nile]] runs through the country, water is scarce during the dry season in areas that are not located on the river.\n\nAbout half the population does not have access to an [[improved water source]], defined as a protected well, standpipe or a handpump within 1&nbsp;km. The few existing piped water supply systems are often not well maintained and the water they provide is often not safe to drink. Displaced people returning home put a huge strain on infrastructure, and the government institutions in charge of the sector are weak. Substantial external funding from numerous government agencies and non-governmental organizations is available to improve water supply.\n\nNumerous non-governmental organizations support water supply in Southern Sudan, such as [[Water is Basic]], the [[Obakki Foundation]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://obakki.com/projects/ |title=Obakki Foundation |publisher=Obakki.com |date= |accessdate=2 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329044131/http://obakki.com/projects/ |archivedate=29 March 2013 }}</ref> and [[Bridgton-Lake Region Rotary Club]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lakeregionrotary.com |title=Rotary Club of Bridgton Lake-Region |publisher=Lakeregionrotary.com |date= |accessdate=2 May 2013}}</ref> from North America.\n\n=== Refugees ===\n[[File:The scale of the problem Jamam refugee camp from the air (6972523516).jpg|thumb|Jamam refugee camp]]\n\nAs of February 2014, South Sudan was host to over 230,000 [[refugee]]s, with the vast majority, over 209,000, having arrived recently from Sudan, because of the [[War in Darfur]].

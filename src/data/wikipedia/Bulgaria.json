It is bordered by [[Romania]] to the north, [[Serbia]] and [[North Macedonia]] to the west, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] to the south, and the [[Black Sea]] to the east. The capital and largest city is [[Sofia]]; other major cities are [[Plovdiv]], [[Varna]] and [[Burgas]]. With a territory of {{convert|110994|km2}}, Bulgaria is Europe's [[List of European countries by area|16th-largest country]]. \n\nOne of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the [[Neolithic]] [[Karanovo culture]], which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for [[Thracians]], [[Persians]], [[Celts]] and [[ancient Macedonians]]; stability came when the [[Roman Empire]] conquered the region in AD 45. The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire lost some of these territories to an invading [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] horde in the late 7th century. The Bulgars founded the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in AD 681, which dominated most of the [[Balkans]] and significantly influenced [[Slavs|Slavic]] cultures by developing the [[Cyrillic script]]. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor [[Basil II]] conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], which reached its apex under [[Ivan Asen II]] (1218\u20131241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule for nearly five centuries.\n\nThe [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u201378)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u201378]] resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|one-party socialist state]] and part of the Soviet-led [[Eastern Bloc]]. The ruling [[Bulgarian Communist Party|Communist Party]] gave up its monopoly on power after the [[revolutions of 1989]] and allowed [[multi-party]] elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a [[democracy]] and a market-based economy.\n\nSince adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the [[sovereign state]] has been a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[parliamentary republic]] with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic centralisation. The population of seven million lives mainly in Sofia and the capital cities of the [[Provinces of Bulgaria|27 provinces]], and the country has suffered significant demographic decline since the late 1980s.\n\nBulgaria is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], and the [[Council of Europe]]; it is a founding state of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the [[UN Security Council]] three times. Its [[market economy]] is part of the [[European Single Market]] and mostly relies on services, followed by industry\u2014especially machine building and mining\u2014and agriculture. [[Corruption in Bulgaria|Widespread corruption]] is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country in the European Union for 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/files/content/pages/2018_CPI_Executive_Summary.pdf |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2018 Executive Summary p. 12 |publisher=[[Transparency International]]|website=transparency.org |access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Bulgaria'' is derived from the ''[[Bulgars]]'', a tribe of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] origin that founded the country.

The [[archipelago]], which is of volcanic origin, is {{convert|1750|km|mi}} east of northern Australia, {{convert|540|km|mi}} northeast of [[New Caledonia]], east of [[New Guinea]], southeast of the [[Solomon Islands]], and west of [[Fiji]].\n\nVanuatu was first inhabited by [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] people. The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator [[Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s|Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s]], who arrived on [[Esp\u00edritu Santo|the largest island]] in 1606. Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 (following the vacancy of the [[Portuguese throne]], which lasted for sixty years, until 1640, when the Portuguese monarchy was restored), Queir\u00f3s claimed the archipelago for Spain, as part of the colonial [[Spanish East Indies]], and named it ''La Austrialia del Esp\u00edritu Santo''.\n\nIn the 1880s, France and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] claimed parts of the archipelago, and in 1906, they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the [[New Hebrides]] through an Anglo\u2013French [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980. Since independence, the country is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].\n{{toc limit}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nVanuatu's name is derived from the word ''[[vanua]]'' (\"land\" or \"home\"),{{sfn|Hess|2009|p=115}} which occurs in several [[Austronesian languages]],{{efn|1=''Vanua'' in turns comes from the [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] ''banua'' \u2013 see {{harvnb|Reuter|2002|p=29}}; and {{harvnb|Reuter|2006|p=326}}}} and the word ''tu'' (\"stand\").

During the 1860s, [[plantations|planters]] in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoa Islands, in need of labourers, encouraged a long-term [[indentured labour]] trade called \"[[blackbirding]]\". At the height of the labour trade, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad. Fragmentary evidence indicates that the current population of Vanuatu is greatly reduced compared to pre-contact times.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn the 19th century, [[missionary|missionaries]], both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]], arrived on the islands. Settlers also came, looking for land on which to establish [[cotton plantation]]s. When international cotton prices collapsed, they switched to coffee, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], bananas, and, most successfully, [[coconut]]s. Initially, British subjects from Australia made up the majority, but the establishment of the Caledonian Company of the New Hebrides in 1882 soon tipped the balance in favour of French subjects.<ref name=\"UsaUSA2009\">{{cite book|title=Vanuatu Country Study Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjuxcXTEJ_sC&pg=PA26|date=30 March 2009|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=978-1-4387-5649-3|page=26}}</ref> By around the start of the 20th century, the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref name=cp/>\n\n[[File:F6F-3 Hellcats of VF-40 at Espiritu Santo 1944.jpg|thumb|left|US Navy [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Hellcats]] on [[Espiritu Santo]] island in February 1944]]\nThe jumbling of French and British interests in the islands brought petitions for one or another of the two powers to annex the territory.

Called the British-French [[Condominium (international law)|Condominium]], it was a unique form of government, with separate governmental systems that came together only in a joint court. The condominium's authority was extended in the Anglo-French Protocol of 1914, although this was not formally ratified until 1922. Melanesians were barred from acquiring the [[citizenship]] of either power and were officially stateless.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn the 1920s, indentured workers from [[Annam (French protectorate)|French Annam]] (now part of [[Vietnam]]) came to work in the plantations in the New Hebrides. They were 437 in 1923, 5,413 in 1930, then after the crisis 1,630 in 1937. There was some social and political unrest among them in 1947.<ref>Charles Robequain, \"[http://www.persee.fr/doc/geo_0003-4010_1950_num_59_317_13156Les Nouvelles-H\u00e9brides et l'immigration annamite]\", ''[[Annales de G\u00e9ographie]]'', t. 59, n\u00b0317, 1950. pp. 391\u2013392</ref>\n\nChallenges to the ''condominium'' government began in the early 1940s. The arrival of [[United States|Americans]] during the [[Second World War]], with their informal habits and relative wealth, contributed to the rise of nationalism in the islands. The belief in a mythical messianic figure named [[John Frum]] was the basis for an indigenous [[cargo cult]] (a movement attempting to obtain industrial goods through magic) promising Melanesian deliverance. Today, John Frum is both a religion and a political party with a member in Parliament.<ref name=cp/>\n\n[[File:Flag of New Hebrides.svg|thumb|1966 flag of the colonial Anglo-French [[New Hebrides]]]]\nThe first political party, established in the early 1970s, was called the New Hebrides National Party.

While well-vegetated, most islands show signs of deforestation. The islands have been logged, particularly of high-value timber, subjected to wide-scale slash-and-burn agriculture, and converted to coconut plantations and cattle ranches, and now show evidence of increased soil erosion and landslides.<ref name=pc/>\n\nMany upland watersheds are being deforested and degraded, and fresh water is becoming increasingly scarce. Proper waste disposal, as well as water and air pollution, are becoming troublesome issues around urban areas and large villages. Additionally, the lack of employment opportunities in industry and inaccessibility to markets have combined to lock rural families into a subsistence or self-reliance mode, putting tremendous pressure on local ecosystems.<ref name=pc/>\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n{{see also|List of birds of Vanuatu}}\n\nDespite its tropical forests, Vanuatu has a limited number of plant and animal species. It has an indigenous flying fox, ''[[Pteropus anetianus]]''. Flying foxes are important rainforest and timber regenerators. They pollinate and seed disperse a wide variety of native trees. Their diet is nectar, pollen and fruit and they are commonly called \"fruit bats\". They are in decline across their South Pacific range. However, governments are increasingly aware of the economic and ecological value of flying foxes and there are calls to increase their protection. There are no indigenous large mammals. The nineteen species of native reptiles include the [[Ramphotyphlops braminus|flowerpot snake]], found only on Efate. The [[Fiji banded iguana]] (''Brachylophus fasciatus'') was introduced as a [[feral]] animal in the 1960s.{{sfn|Sprackland|1992}}<ref name=lp/> There are eleven species of bats (three unique to Vanuatu) and sixty-one species of land and water birds. While the small [[Polynesian rat]] is thought to be indigenous, the large species arrived with Europeans, as did domesticated hogs, dogs, and cattle. The ant species of some of the islands of Vanuatu were catalogued by [[E. O. Wilson]].{{sfn|Wilson|1994}}\n\nThe region is rich in sea life, with more than 4,000 species of marine molluscs and a large diversity of [[List of fishes of the Coral Sea|marine fishes]]. Cone snails and stonefish carry poison fatal to humans.

The President may be removed by the electoral college for gross misconduct or incapacity.\n\nThe [[Prime Minister of Vanuatu|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]], is elected by a majority vote of a three-quarters [[quorum]] of the Parliament. The Prime Minister, in turn, appoints the Council of Ministers, whose number may not exceed a quarter of the number of parliamentary representatives. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers constitute the executive government.\n\nThe [[Parliament of Vanuatu]] is [[unicameral]] and has 52 members,<ref>[http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/vu/legis/consol_sub/rotpcas654/rotpcas654.html?stem=&synonyms=&query=members%20of%20parliament Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies and Seats)].</ref> who are elected by popular vote every four years unless earlier dissolved by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum or by a directive from the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. The national Council of Chiefs, called the ''[[Malvatu Mauri]]'' and elected by district councils of chiefs, advises the government on all matters concerning ni-Vanuatu culture and language.\n\nBesides national authorities and figures, Vanuatu also has high-placed people at the village level. Chiefs continue to be the leading figures at the village level. It has been reported that even politicians need to oblige them.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet:Vanuatu\">Lonely Planet:Vanuatu</ref> One becomes such a figure by holding a number of lavish feasts (each feast allowing them a higher ceremonial grade) or alternatively through inheritance (the latter only in Polynesian-influenced villages). In northern Vanuatu, feasts are graded through the nimangki-system.\n\nGovernment and society in Vanuatu tend to divide along linguistic French and English lines. Forming [[coalition government]]s, however, has proved problematic at times due to differences between English and French speakers. Francophone politicians like those of the [[Union of Moderate Parties]] tend to be conservative and support neo-liberal policies, as well as closer relations with France and the West. The anglophone [[Vanua'aku Pati]] identifies as socialist and anti-colonial.\n\nThe [[Supreme Court of Vanuatu|Supreme Court]] consists of a chief justice and up to three other judges. Two or more members of this court may constitute a Court of Appeal. Magistrate courts handle most routine legal matters. The legal system is based on [[Common law|British common law]] and [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Vanuatu|constitution]] also provides for the establishment of village or island courts presided over by chiefs to deal with questions of [[Custom (law)|customary law]].\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Vanuatu}}\nVanuatu has joined the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the ''[[Agence de Coop\u00e9ration Culturelle et Technique]]'', ''la [[Francophonie]]'' and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\nSince 1980, Australia, the United Kingdom, France and New Zealand have provided the bulk of Vanuatu's development aid. Direct aid from the UK to Vanuatu ceased in 2005 following the decision by the UK to no longer focus on the Pacific.\n\nMore recently, new donors such as the [[Millennium Challenge Account]] (MCA) of the United States and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] have been providing increased amounts of aid funding and loans. In 2005 the MCA announced that Vanuatu was one of the first 15 countries in the world selected to receive support \u2014 an amount of US$65&nbsp;million was given for the provision and upgrading of key pieces of [[public infrastructure]].\n\nIn 2018, newspaper reports from Australia indicated growing concern about the level of Chinese investment in Vanuatu, with over 50% of the country's debt of $440 million owed to China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/on-the-ground-in-vanuatu-monuments-to-china-s-growing-influence-are-everywhere-20180410-p4z8t0.html|title=On the ground in Vanuatu, monuments to China's growing influence are everywhere|last=Wroe|first=David|date=2018-04-10|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref> Concern was focused on the possibility China would use Vanuatu's potential inability to repay debt as leverage to bargain for control of, or [[People's Liberation Army]] presence at, [[Luganville]] Wharf.

The names in English of all provinces are derived from the initial letters of their constituent islands:\n\n* [[Malampa Province|Malampa]] ('''Mal'''akula, '''Am'''brym, '''Pa'''ama)\n* [[Penama Province|Penama]] ('''Pen'''tecost, '''Am'''bae, '''Ma'''ewo&nbsp;\u2013 in French: P\u00e9nama)\n* [[Sanma Province|Sanma]] ('''San'''to, '''Ma'''lo)\n* [[Shefa Province|Shefa]] ('''Sh'''epherds group, '''Efa'''te&nbsp;\u2013 in French: Sh\u00e9fa)\n* [[Tafea Province|Tafea]] ('''T'''anna, '''A'''niwa, '''F'''utuna, '''E'''rromango, '''A'''neityum&nbsp;\u2013 in French: Taf\u00e9a)\n* [[Torba Province|Torba]] ('''Tor'''res Islands, '''Ba'''nks Islands)\n\nProvinces are autonomous units with their own popularly elected local parliaments known officially as provincial councils. They collect local taxes and make by-laws in local matters like tourism, the provincial budget or the provision of some basic services. They are headed by a chairman elected from among the members of the local parliaments and assisted by a secretary appointed by the [[Civil service commission|Public Service Commission]].\n\nTheir executive arm consists of a provincial government headed by an executive officer who is appointed by the Prime Minister with the advice of the minister of local government. The provincial government is usually formed by the party that has the majority in the provincial council and, like the national government, is advised in Ni-Vanuatu culture and language by the local council of chiefs. The provincial president is constitutionally a member of the electoral college that elects the President of Vanuatu.\n\nThe provinces are in turn divided into municipalities (usually consisting of an individual island) headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Vanuatu}}\n[[File:Vanuatu Exports Treemap (2009)..jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Vanuatu's exports]]\n[[File:PortVilaMarketHall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A market hall in Port Vila]]\n\nThe four mainstays of the economy are agriculture, tourism, offshore [[financial services]], and [[cattle raising|raising cattle]]. There is substantial fishing activity, although this industry does not bring in much foreign exchange. Exports include [[copra]], [[kava]], beef, cocoa and timber, and imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs and fuels. In contrast, mining activity is unsubstantial.\n\nAlthough manganese mining halted in 1978, there was an agreement in 2006 to export manganese already mined but not yet exported. The country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light-industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties and a 15% [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] on goods and services. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances between constituent islands and from main markets.\n\nAgriculture is used for consumption as well as for export. It provides a living for 65% of the population. In particular, production of copra and kava create substantial revenue. Many farmers have been abandoning cultivation of food crops, and use earnings from kava cultivation to buy food.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet:Vanuatu\"/> Kava has also been used in ceremonial exchanges between clans and villages.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 33&nbsp;\u2013 5.2)</ref> Cocoa is also grown for foreign exchange.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 49&nbsp;\u2013 7.2)</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the number of households engaged in fishing was 15,758, mainly for consumption (99%), and the average number of weekly fishing trips was 3.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 77&nbsp;\u2013 13.1)</ref> The tropical climate enables growing of a wide range of fruits and vegetables and spices, including banana, garlic, cabbage, peanuts, pineapples, sugarcane, taro, yams, watermelons, leaf spices, carrots, radishes, eggplants, vanilla (both green and cured), pepper, cucumber and many others.<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 114&nbsp;\u2013 table 4.17)</ref> In 2007, the value (in terms of millions of [[vatu]]&nbsp;\u2013 the official currency of Vanuatu), for agricultural products, was estimated for different products: kava (341 million vatu), copra (195), cattle (135), crop gardens (93), cocoa (59), forestry (56), fishing (24) and coffee (12).<ref>Census of Agriculture 2007 (various pages)</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Tourism}}\nTourism brings in much-needed foreign exchange. Vanuatu is widely recognised as one of the premier vacation destinations for scuba divers wishing to explore coral reefs of the South Pacific region.{{sfn|Harris|2006}} A further significant attraction to scuba divers is the wreck of the US ocean liner and converted troop carrier ''[[SS President Coolidge]]'' on [[Espiritu Santo]] island. Sunk during World War II, it is one of the largest shipwrecks in the world that is accessible for recreational diving. Tourism increased 17% from 2007 to 2008 to reach 196,134 arrivals, according to one estimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/documents/fact_sheets/van.asp|title=Asian Development Bank & Vanuatu&nbsp;\u2013 Fact Sheet (pdf file)|publisher=Asian Development Bank|date=31 December 2008|accessdate=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403190139/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Fact_Sheets/VAN.asp|archive-date=3 April 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The 2008 total is a sharp increase from 2000, in which there were only 57,000 visitors (of these, 37,000 were from Australia, 8,000 from New Zealand, 6,000 from New Caledonia, 3,000 from Europe, 1,000 from North America, 1,000 from Japan.

Two years later, Australia's ''[[Celebrity Survivor]]'' was filmed at the same location used by the US version. In mid-2002, the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism.\n\nFinancial services are an important part of the economy. Vanuatu is a [[tax haven]] that until 2008 did not release account information to other governments or law-enforcement agencies. International pressure, mainly from Australia, influenced the Vanuatu government to begin adhering to international norms to improve transparency. In Vanuatu, there is no [[income tax]], [[withholding tax]], [[capital gains tax]], [[inheritance tax]], or exchange control. Many international ship-management companies choose to flag their ships under the Vanuatu flag, because of the tax benefits and favourable labour laws (Vanuatu is a full member of the [[International Maritime Organization]] and applies its international conventions).

Bishop Museum.JPG|thumb|upright|Wooden [[Slit drum (Vanuatu)|slit drums]] from Vanuatu, [[Bernice P. Bishop Museum]]]]\n\nVanuatu culture retains a strong diversity through local regional variations and through foreign influence. Vanuatu may be divided into three major cultural regions. In the north, wealth is established by how much one can give away, through a [[grade-taking]] system. Pigs, particularly those with rounded [[tusk]]s, are considered a symbol of wealth throughout Vanuatu. In the centre, more traditional Melanesian cultural systems dominate. In the south, a system involving grants of title with associated privileges has developed.<ref name=\"tourism\">{{cite web| publisher = Vanuatu Tourism Office| url = http://www.vanuatutourism.com/vanuatu/export/sites/VTO/en/culture/culture.html| title = Culture of Vanuatu| accessdate = 16 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520205556/http://www.vanuatutourism.com/vanuatu/export/sites/VTO/en/culture/culture.html |archivedate = 20 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nYoung men undergo various coming-of-age ceremonies and rituals<ref>{{cite web|author=Elisabeth Hurtel |url=http://www.imagesud.com/photographie-art/?cat=21|title=Customs dances and ceremonies in Vanuatu|accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> to initiate them into manhood, usually including [[circumcision]].\n\nMost villages have a ''[[nakamal]]'' or village clubhouse which serves as a meeting point for men and as a place to drink ''[[kava]]''. Villages also have male- and female-only sections. These sections are situated all over the villages; in ''nakamals'', special spaces are provided for females when they are in their menstruation period.\n\nThere are few prominent ni-Vanuatu authors. [[Women's rights]] activist [[Grace Mera Molisa]], who died in 2002, achieved international notability as a descriptive poet.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Vanuatu}}\n[[File:Vanuatu-humans-of-vanuatu-2.jpg|thumb|alt=A women's dance from Vanuatu, using bamboo stamping tubes.|A women's dance from Vanuatu, using [[Bamboo musical instruments|bamboo stamping tubes]]]]\n\nThe traditional [[music of Vanuatu]] is still thriving in the rural areas of Vanuatu. Musical instruments consist mostly of [[idiophone]]s: drums of various shape and size, [[slit gong]]s, [[Bamboo musical instruments|stamping tubes]], as well as [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s, among others. Another musical genre that has become widely popular during the 20th century in all areas of Vanuatu, is known as ''[[string band]]'' music. It combines guitars, [[ukulele]], and popular songs.\n\nMore recently the music of Vanuatu, as an industry, grew rapidly in the 1990s and several bands have forged a distinctive ni-Vanuatu identity. Popular genres of modern commercial music, which are currently being played in the urban areas include [[zouk]] music and [[reggaeton]]. Reggaeton, a variation of Dancehall Reggae spoken in the Spanish language, played alongside its own distinctive beat, is especially played in the local nightclubs of Port Vila with, mostly, an audience of Westerners and tourists.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Cuisine of Vanuatu}}\n\nThe [[cuisine of Vanuatu]] (''aelan kakae'') incorporates fish, root vegetables such as [[taro]] and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, fruits, and vegetables. Most island families grow food in their gardens, and food shortages are rare. Papayas, pineapples, mangoes, [[plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, and sweet potatoes are abundant through much of the year. Coconut milk and coconut cream are used to flavour many dishes. Most food is cooked using hot stones or through boiling and steaming; very little food is fried.<ref name=pc/>\n\nThe national dish of Vanuatu is the [[laplap]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/correspondents/content/2008/s2528790.htm The secrets of Vanuatu's national dish, the Lap Lap].

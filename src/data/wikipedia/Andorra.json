The oldest derivation of the word ''Andorra'' is from the Greek historian [[Polybius]] (''[[The Histories (Polybius)|The Histories]]'' III, 35, 1) who describes the ''Andosins'', an [[Iberians|Iberian]] [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|Pre-Roman tribe]], as historically located in the valleys of Andorra and facing the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginian]] army in its passage through the Pyrenees during the [[Punic Wars]]. The word ''Andosini'' or ''Andosins'' (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9) may derive from the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''handia'' whose meaning is \"big\" or \"giant\".<ref name=\"Diccionari\">''Diccionari d'Hist\u00f2ria de Catalunya''; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; {{ISBN|84-297-3521-6}}; p. 42; entrada \"Andorra\"</ref> The Andorran [[toponymy]] shows evidence of [[Basque language]] in the area. Another theory suggests that the word ''Andorra'' may derive from the old word ''Anorra'' that contains the Basque word ''ur'' (water).<ref>{{cite book|last=Font Rius |first=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda |title=Estudis sobre els drets i institucions locals en la Catalunya medieval |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQL6rtB8VtQC&pg=PA743&dq=Anorra+andorra#v=onepage&q=Anorra%20andorra |publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona |year=1985 |page=743 |isbn=978-8475281742 }}</ref>\n\nAnother theory suggests that ''Andorra'' may derive from [[Arabic]] ''al-durra'', meaning \"The forest\" (\u0627\u0644\u062f\u0631\u0629).

In recent times, however, its thriving tourist industry along with developments in transport and communications have removed the country from its isolation. Since 1976 the country sees the need to reform Andorran institutions due to the anachronisms in the field of sovereignty, human rights and the balance of powers as well as the need to adapt legislation to modern demands. In 1982 a first separation of powers took place when instituting the ''Govern d'Andorra'', under the name of ''Executive Board'' (''Consell Executiu''), chaired by the first prime minister [[\u00d2scar Ribas Reig]] with the approval of the Co-Princes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elnacional.cat/ca/efemerides/marc-pons-andorra-primer-cap-govern_227061_102.html|title=Andorra tria el primer cap de govern de la seva hist\u00f2ria|website=ElNacional.cat}}</ref> In 1989 the Principality signed an agreement with the [[European Economic Community]] to regularize trade relations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:21990A1231(02)|title=EUR-Lex - 21990A1231(02) - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}</ref>\n\nIts political system was modernized in 1993 after the [[Andorran constitutional referendum, 1993|Andorran constitutional referendum]], when the [[Constitution of Andorra|constitution]] was drafted by the Co-Princes and the General Council and approved on 14 March<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & St\u00f6ver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', p160 {{ISBN|978-3-8329-5609-7}}</ref> by 74.2% of voters, with a 76% turnout.<ref>Nohlen & St\u00f6ver, p162</ref> The [[Andorran parliamentary election, 1993|first elections]] under the new constitution were held later in the year.<ref name=NS/> The same year Andorra became a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Council of Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.exteriors.ad/es/asuntos-multilaterales-y-cooperaciin/andorra-y-los-organismos-internacionales|title=Andorra y los organismos internacionales|website=Exteriors.ad}}</ref>\n\nAndorra formalized diplomatic relations with the [[United States]] in 1996 participating in the 51st [[UN General Assembly]], a very important fact in view of the normalization that the country aspired to.

This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as [[Prince of Andorra]], an elected reigning monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|Head of Government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wikt:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.\n\nThe current Head of Government is [[Antoni Mart\u00ed]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.\n\nThe Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors. The Councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.\n\n[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, Historical and Ceremonial Andorran Parliament.]]\n[[File:Casa de la Vall, Andorra la Vieja, Andorra, 2013-12-30, DD 03.JPG|thumb|The [[New Parliament of Andorra]], [[General Council of Andorra|General Council]] headquarter since 2011, next to [[Casa de la Vall]].]]\n[[File:Els 7 poetes, Casa de la Vall, Consell General.JPG|thumb|The centre of government in [[Andorra la Vella]].]]\n\nHalf are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the Councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.\n\nCandidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-Princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.\n\nThe Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.\n\nIf the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.\n\n==Law and criminal justice==\n{{Main|Law of Andorra}}\nThe judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-Princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.\n\nThe Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.\n\n==Foreign relations, defence, and security==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}\n[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]].]]\nAndorra does not have its own armed forces,<ref name=\"cia\"/> although there is a small ceremonial army.

Andorra's land area is {{convert|468|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}}.\n\n[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Andorra belongs to the Atlantic European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Andorra belongs to the [[ecoregion]] of Pyrenees conifer and mixed forests.\n\n===Climate===\nAndorra has an [[alpine climate]] and [[continental climate]]. Its higher elevation means there is, on average, more snow in winter, lower humidity, and it is slightly cooler in summer. The diversity of landmarks, the different orientation of the valleys and the irregularity relief typical of the [[Mediterranean climate]]s make the country have a great diversity of [[microclimate]]s that hinder the general dominance of the [[Mountain climate|high mountain climate]]. The great differences of altitude in the minimum and maximum points, together with the influence of a Mediterranean climate, develop the climate of the Andorran Pyrenees.\n\nWhen in precipitation, a global model characterized by convective and abundant rains can be defined during spring and summer, which can last until autumn (May, June and August are usually the rainiest months); In winter, however, it is less rainy, except in the highlands, subject to the influence of fronts from the [[Atlantic Europe|Atlantic]], which explains the high level of innivation of the Andorran mountains.

Andorra lacked a currency of its own and used both the [[French franc]] and the [[Spanish peseta]] in banking transactions until 31 December 1999, when both currencies were replaced by the EU's single currency, the euro. Coins and notes of both the franc and the peseta remained legal tender in Andorra until 31 December 2002.

The [[sovereign state]] is separated from the [[Comoros]], [[Mayotte]] and [[Madagascar]] by the [[Mozambique Channel]] to the east. The capital of Mozambique is [[Maputo]] (formerly known as \"Louren\u00e7o Marques\" from 1876 to 1976) while [[Matola]] is the largest city, being a suburb of Maputo.\n\nBetween the first and fifth centuries AD, [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples migrated to present-day Mozambique from farther north and west. Northern Mozambique lies within the monsoon trade winds of the Indian Ocean. Between the 7th and 11th centuries, a series of Swahili port towns developed here, which contributed to the development of a distinct [[Swahili culture]] and [[Swahili language|language]]. In the late medieval period, these towns were frequented by traders from Somalia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Arabia, Persia, and India.<ref>Newitt, M.D.D. \"A Short History of Mozambique.\" Oxford University Press, 2017</ref>\n\nThe voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] in 1498 marked the arrival of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]], who began a gradual process of colonisation and settlement in 1505. After over four centuries of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Portuguese rule]], Mozambique [[Mozambican War of Independence|gained independence]] in 1975, becoming the [[People's Republic of Mozambique]] shortly thereafter. After only two years of independence, the country descended into an intense and protracted [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] lasting from 1977 to 1992. In 1994, Mozambique held its first multiparty elections, and has since remained a relatively stable [[presidential republic]], although it still faces a [[RENAMO insurgency (2013\u2013present)|low-intensity insurgency]].<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/19787524/Provincial_Autonomy_The_Territorial_Dimension_of_Peace_in_Mozambique|title=Provincial Autonomy: The Territorial Dimension of Peace in Mozambique|first=Nat\u00e1lia Bueno|last=Schenoni|date=|work=academia.edu}}</ref>\n\nMozambique is endowed with rich and extensive natural resources. The country's economy is based largely on agriculture, but industry is growing, mainly food and beverages, chemical manufacturing and aluminium and petroleum production. The tourism sector is also expanding.

The country's population of around {{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Mozambique}}|R}}/1e6 round 0}} million is composed overwhelmingly of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu people]]. The largest religion in Mozambique is Christianity, with significant minorities following Islam and African traditional religions.

Largely autonomous, these towns broadly participated in the incipient [[Swahili culture]]. Islam was often adopted by urban elites, facilitating trade. In Mozambique, [[Sofala]], [[Angoche]], and [[Mozambique Island]] were regional powers by the 15th century.\n\nThe towns traded with merchants from both the African interior and the broader Indian Ocean world. Particularly important were the gold and ivory caravan routes. Inland states like the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]] and [[Kingdom of Mutapa]] provided the coveted gold and ivory, which were then exchanged up the coast to larger port cities like [[Kilwa]] and [[Mombasa]].<ref>Newitt, Malyn. \"Mozambique Island: The Rise and Decline of an East African Coastal City\" 2004.</ref>\n\n=== Portuguese Mozambique (1498\u20131975) ===\n{{Further|Portuguese Mozambique}}\n[[File:Mozambique n2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|The [[Island of Mozambique]] is a small coral island at the mouth of Mossuril Bay on the [[Nacala]] coast of northern Mozambique, first explored by Europeans in the late 15th century.]]\n\nFrom about 1500, Portuguese trading posts and forts displaced the Arabic commercial and military hegemony, becoming regular ports of call on the new European sea route to the east.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>\n\nThe voyage of [[Vasco da Gama]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1498 marked the Portuguese entry into trade, politics, and society of the region. The Portuguese gained control of the [[Island of Mozambique]] and the port city of [[Sofala]] in the early 16th century, and by the 1530s, small groups of Portuguese traders and [[prospecting|prospectors]] seeking gold penetrated the interior regions, where they set up garrisons and trading posts at [[Sena, Mozambique|Sena]] and [[Tete]] on the River [[Zambezi]] and tried to gain exclusive control over the gold trade.<ref name=\"auto\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=6CuZ3lXGFz4C&pg=PP1&dq=Arming+slaves Arming Slaves], ''Arming slaves: from classical times to the modern age'', Christopher Leslie Brown, Philip D.

While ''prazos'' were originally developed to be held by Portuguese, through intermarriage they became African Portuguese or African Indian centres defended by large African slave armies known as ''[[Kunda people|Chikunda]]''.{{clarify|date=December 2018}}{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\nHistorically within Mozambique there was slavery. Human beings were bought and sold by African tribal chiefs, first to Arab Muslim traders and sent to Middle East Asia cities and plantations, and later to Portuguese and other European traders as well. Many Mozambican slaves were supplied by tribal chiefs who raided warring tribes and sold their captives to the ''prazeiros''.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n[[File:Lourenco-Marques-pc-c1905.jpg|thumb|View of the Central Avenue in Louren\u00e7o Marques, now Maputo, ca. 1905;]]\n\nAlthough Portuguese influence gradually expanded, its power was limited and exercised through individual settlers and officials who were granted extensive autonomy. The Portuguese were able to wrest much of the coastal trade from Arab Muslims between 1500 and 1700, but, with the Arab Muslim seizure of Portugal's key foothold at [[Fort Jesus]] on [[Mombasa Island]] (now in Kenya) in 1698, the pendulum began to swing in the other direction. As a result, investment lagged while [[Lisbon]] devoted itself to the more lucrative trade with India and the Far East and to the colonisation of Brazil.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>\n\nDuring these wars, the [[Mazrui]] and [[History of Oman|Omani Arabs]] reclaimed much of the Indian Ocean trade, forcing the Portuguese to retreat south. Many ''prazos'' had declined by the mid-19th century, but several of them survived. During the 19th century other European powers, particularly the British ([[British South Africa Company]]) and the French (Madagascar), became increasingly involved in the trade and politics of the region around the [[Portuguese East Africa]]n territories.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:TT CMZ-AF-GT E 2-1 10 81 - Oficina de Tipografia da Escola de Artes e Of\u00edcios.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Portuguese language printing and typesetting class, 1930]]\n\nBy the early 20th century the Portuguese had shifted the administration of much of Mozambique to large private companies, like the [[Mozambique Company]], the [[Zambezia Province|Zambezia Company]] and the [[Niassa Company]], controlled and financed mostly by \"British\" financiers such as [[Solomon Joel]], which established railroad lines to their neighbouring colonies (South Africa and Rhodesia). Although slavery had been legally abolished in Mozambique, at the end of the 19th century the Chartered companies enacted a forced labour policy and supplied cheap\u2014often forced\u2014African labour to the [[mining|mines]] and [[plantation]]s of the nearby British colonies and South Africa.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/> The Zambezia Company, the most profitable chartered company, took over a number of smaller ''prazeiro'' holdings, and established military outposts to protect its property.

These movements claimed that since policies and development plans were primarily designed by the ruling authorities for the benefit of Mozambique's Portuguese population, little attention was paid to Mozambique's tribal integration and the development of its native communities.<ref>Dinerman, Alice (26 September 2007).

Many felt they had received too little opportunity or resources to upgrade their skills and improve their economic and social situation to a degree comparable to that of the Europeans. Statistically, Mozambique's Portuguese whites were indeed wealthier and more skilled than the black indigenous majority. As a response to the guerrilla movement, the Portuguese government from the 1960s and principally the early 1970s, initiated gradual changes with new socioeconomic developments and egalitarian policies for all. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nThe Front for the Liberation of Mozambique ([[FRELIMO]]) initiated a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule in September 1964.

RENAMO accused FRELIMO of fraud, and threatened to return to civil war, but backed down after taking the matter to the Supreme Court and losing.\n\nIn early 2000, a [[cyclone]] caused [[2000 Mozambique flood|widespread flooding]] in the country, killing hundreds and devastating the already precarious infrastructure. There were widespread suspicions that foreign aid resources had been diverted by powerful leaders of FRELIMO. [[Carlos Cardoso (journalist)|Carlos Cardoso]], a journalist investigating these allegations, was murdered, and his death was never satisfactorily explained.\n\nIndicating in 2001 that he would not run for a third term, Chissano criticised leaders who stayed on longer than he had, which was generally seen as a reference to [[Zambia]]n president [[Frederick Chiluba]], who at the time was considering a third term, and [[Zimbabwe]]an president [[Robert Mugabe]], then in his fourth term. Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on 1\u20132 December 2004. FRELIMO candidate [[Armando Guebuza]] won with 64% of the popular vote, while his opponent, [[Afonso Dhlakama]] of RENAMO, received 32% of the popular vote. FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament, with a coalition of RENAMO and several small parties winning the 90 remaining seats. Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of Mozambique on 2 February 2005, and served two five-year terms. His successor, [[Filipe Nyusi]], became the 4th President of Mozambique on 15 January 2015.\n\nSince 2013, a low-intensity [[RENAMO insurgency (2013\u2013present)|insurgency by RENAMO]] has been occurring, mainly in the country's central and northern regions. On 5 September 2014, former president Guebuza and the leader of RENAMO Dhlakama signed the Accord on Cessation of Hostilities, which brought the military hostilities to a halt and allowed both parties to concentrate on the general elections to be held in October 2014. However, after the general elections, a new political crisis emerged and the country appears to be once again on the brink of violent conflict.

It is comparable in size to Turkey. Mozambique is located on the southeast coast of Africa. It is bound by Swaziland to the south, South Africa to the southwest, Zimbabwe to the west, [[Zambia]] and [[Malawi]] to the northwest, [[Tanzania]] to the north and the Indian Ocean to the east. Mozambique lies between latitudes [[10th parallel south|10\u00b0]] and [[27th parallel south|27\u00b0S]], and longitudes [[30th meridian east|30\u00b0]] and [[41st meridian east|41\u00b0E]].\n\nThe country is divided into two topographical regions by the [[Zambezi River]]. To the north of the [[Zambezi]] River, the narrow coastal strip gives way to inland hills and low plateaus. Rugged highlands are further west; they include the [[Niassa]] highlands, [[Namuli]] or Shire highlands, Angonia highlands, [[Tete]] highlands and the [[Makonde (District)|Makonde]] plateau, covered with [[miombo]] woodlands. To the south of the Zambezi River, the lowlands are broader with the Mashonaland plateau and [[Lebombo Mountains]] located in the deep south.\n\nThe country is drained by five principal rivers and several smaller ones with the largest and most important the Zambezi. The country has four notable lakes: [[Lake Niassa]] (or Malawi), [[Lake Chiuta]], [[Lake Cahora Bassa]] and [[Lake Shirwa]], all in the north. The major cities are [[Maputo]], [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Nampula]], [[Tete]], [[Quelimane]], [[Chimoio]], [[Pemba, Mozambique|Pemba]], [[Inhambane]], [[Xai-Xai]] and [[Lichinga]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" caption=\"Geography of Mozambique\">\nFile:Ghost mountain mkuze sunset.jpg|[[Lebombo Mountains]]\nFile:Gorongosa - Gogogo peak.

The executive branch comprises a President, [[Heads of Government of Mozambique|Prime Minister]], and Council of Ministers. There is a [[Assembly of the Republic of Mozambique|National Assembly]] and municipal assemblies. The judiciary comprises a Supreme Court and provincial, district, and municipal courts. [[Suffrage]] is universal at eighteen. In the 1994 [[Elections in Mozambique|elections]], [[Joaquim Chissano]] was elected President with 53% of the vote, and a 250-member National Assembly was voted in with 129 [[FRELIMO|Liberation Front of Mozambique]] ([[FRELIMO]]) deputies, 112 [[RENAMO|Mozambican National Resistance]] ([[RENAMO]]) deputies, and nine representatives of three smaller parties that formed the Democratic Union (UD). Since its formation in 1994, the National Assembly has made progress in becoming a body increasingly more independent of the executive. By 1999, more than one-half (53%) of the legislation passed originated in the Assembly.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>\n\nAfter some delays, in 1998 the country held its first local elections to provide for local representation and some budgetary authority at the municipal level. The principal opposition party, RENAMO, boycotted the local elections, citing flaws in the registration process. Independent slates contested the elections and won seats in municipal assemblies. Turnout was very low.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1998 local elections, the government resolved to make more accommodations to the opposition's procedural concerns for the second round of multiparty national elections in 1999. Working through the National Assembly, the electoral law was rewritten and passed by consensus in December 1998. Financed largely by international donors, a very successful voter registration was conducted from July to September 1999, providing voter registration cards to 85% of the potential electorate (more than seven million voters).<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>\n\nThe second general elections were held 3\u20135 December 1999, with high [[voter turnout]]. International and domestic observers agreed that the voting process was well organised and went smoothly. Both the opposition and observers subsequently cited flaws in the tabulation process that, had they not occurred, might have changed the outcome. In the end, however, international and domestic observers concluded that the close result of the vote reflected the will of the people.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>\n\nPresident Chissano won the presidency with a margin of 4% over the RENAMO-Electoral Union coalition candidate, [[Afonso Dhlakama]], and began his five-year term in January 2000. [[FRELIMO]] increased its majority in the National Assembly with 133 out of 250 seats. RENAMO-UE coalition won 116 seats, one went independent, and no third parties are represented.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>\n\nThe opposition coalition did not accept the National Election Commission's results of the presidential vote and filed a formal complaint to the Supreme Court. One month after the voting, the court dismissed the opposition's challenge and validated the election results. The opposition did not file a complaint about the results of the legislative vote.<ref name=BilateralRelationsFactSheet/>\n\nThe second local elections, involving thirty-three municipalities with some 2.4&nbsp;million registered voters, took place in November 2003. This was the first time that FRELIMO, RENAMO-UE, and independent parties competed without significant boycotts. The 24% turnout was well above the 15% turnout in the first municipal elections. FRELIMO won twenty-eight mayoral positions and the majority in twenty-nine municipal assemblies, while RENAMO won five mayoral positions and the majority in four municipal assemblies. The voting was conducted in an orderly fashion without violent incidents. However, the period immediately after the elections was marked by objections about voter and candidate registration and vote tabulation, as well as calls for greater transparency.\n\nIn May 2009, the government approved a new general elections law that contained innovations based on the experience of the 2003 municipal elections. Presidential and National Assembly elections took place on 1\u20132 December 2004. FRELIMO candidate [[Armando Guebuza]] won with 64% of the popular vote. His opponent, Afonso Dhlakama of RENAMO, received 32% of the popular vote. FRELIMO won 160 seats in Parliament. A coalition of RENAMO and several small parties won the 90 remaining seats. Armando Guebuza was inaugurated as the President of Mozambique on 2 February 2005.\n\nRENAMO and some other opposition parties made claims of election fraud and denounced the result. These claims were supported by international observers (among others by the European Union Election Observation Mission to Mozambique and the Carter Centre) to the elections who criticised the fact that the National Electoral Commission (CNE) did not conduct fair and transparent elections. They listed a whole range of shortcomings by the electoral authorities that benefited the ruling party FRELIMO.\n\nAccording to EU observers, the elections shortcomings have probably not affected the final result in the presidential election. On the other hand, the observers have declared that the outcome of the parliamentary election and thus the distribution of seats in the National Assembly does not reflect the will of the Mozambican people and is clearly to the disadvantage of RENAMO.\n\nAfter clashes between RENAMO guards and the police in Muxungue and Gondola in April 2013, RENAMO said it would boycott and disrupt local elections in November 2013. Since the end of the civil war in 1992, about 300 RENAMO guards had remained armed and refused to join the national army or the police force.<ref>(4 April 2013) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-22031922 Mozambican ex-rebels Renamo in police clash] BBC News Africa, Retrieved 5 April 2013.</ref>\n\n===Foreign relations===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Mozambique}}\n[[File:Embassy of Mozambique, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|Mozambique's embassy in Washington, D.C.]]\nWhile allegiances dating back to the liberation struggle remain relevant, Mozambique's foreign policy has become increasingly pragmatic.

In 1994, the government became a full member of the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]], in part to broaden its base of international support but also to please the country's sizeable Muslim population. Similarly, in 1995 Mozambique joined its [[Anglophone]] neighbours in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. At the time it was the only nation to have joined the Commonwealth that was never part of the [[British Empire]].

Yet, despite this apparent success, both the World Bank and [[UNICEF]] used the word 'paradox' to describe rising chronic [[child malnutrition]] in the face of GDP growth.

All Mozambicans are required by law to attend school through the primary level; however, a lot of children in Mozambique do not go to primary school because they have to work for their families' subsistence farms for a living. In 2007, one million children still did not go to school, most of them from poor rural families, and almost half of all teachers in Mozambique were still unqualified. Girls\u2019 enrollment increased from 3 million in 2002 to 4.1 million in 2006 while the completion rate increased from 31,000 to 90,000, which testified a very poor completion rate.<ref>[http://www.dfid.gov.uk/casestudies/files/africa/mozambique-primary-schools.asp Key facts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109185153/http://www.dfid.gov.uk/casestudies/files/africa/mozambique-primary-schools.asp |date=9 January 2009 }}, Department for International Development (DFID), UK Government (24 May 2007)</ref>\n\nAfter grade 7, pupils must take standardised national exams to enter secondary school, which runs from eighth to 10th grade. {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Space in Mozambican universities is extremely limited; thus most pupils who complete pre-university school do not immediately proceed on to university studies. Many go to work as teachers or are unemployed. There are also institutes which give more vocational training, specialising in agricultural, technical or pedagogical studies, which students may attend after grade 10 in lieu of a pre-university school.\n\nAfter independence from Portugal in 1975, a number of Mozambican pupils continued to be admitted every year at Portuguese high schools, polytechnical institutes and universities, through bilateral agreements between the Portuguese government and the Mozambican government.\n\nAccording to 2010 estimates, the [[literacy rate]] of Mozambique was 56.1% (70.8% male and 42.8% female).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mz.html|title=The World Factbook|work=cia.gov}}</ref> By 2015, this had increased to 58.8% (73.3% male and 45.4% female).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=EDULIT_DS&popupcustomise=true&lang=en#|title=Education|first=|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Mozambique - mask.jpg|thumb|upright|Woman with traditional mask in Mozambique]]\n[[File:Museu Da Ilha De Mocambique (33387901932).jpg|thumb|[[Island of Mozambique]], 2016]]\n{{Main|Culture of Mozambique}}\n\n===Cultural identity===\nMozambique was ruled by Portugal, and they share a main language (Portuguese) and main religion (Roman Catholicism). But since most of the people of Mozambique are [[Bantus]], most of the culture is native; for Bantus living in urban areas, there is some Portuguese influence. Mozambican culture also influences the [[culture of Portugal|Portuguese culture]].\n\n===Arts===\nThe [[Makonde people|Makonde]] are known for their wood carving and elaborate masks, that are commonly used in traditional dances. There are two different kinds of wood carvings: [[shetani]], (evil spirits), which are mostly carved in heavy [[ebony]], tall, and elegantly curved with symbols and nonrepresentational faces; and [[ujamaa]], which are totem-type carvings which illustrate lifelike faces of people and various figures. These sculptures are usually referred to as \"family trees\", because they tell stories of many generations.\n\nDuring the last years of the colonial period, Mozambican art reflected the oppression by the colonial power, and became symbol of the resistance. After independence in 1975, the modern art came into a new phase. The two best known and most influential contemporary Mozambican artists are the painter [[Malangatana Ngwenya]] and the sculptor [[Alberto Chissano]]. A lot of the post-independence art during the 1980s and 1990s reflect the political struggle, civil war, suffering, starvation, and struggle.\n\nDances are usually intricate, highly developed traditions throughout Mozambique. There are many different kinds of dances from tribe to tribe which are usually ritualistic in nature. The Chopi, for instance, act out battles dressed in animal skins. The men of [[Makua (people)|Makua]] dress in colourful outfits and masks while dancing on stilts around the village for hours. Groups of women in the northern part of the country perform a traditional dance called [[Tufo (dance)|''tufo'']], to celebrate [[Islam]]ic holidays.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Fitzpatrick\n  | first =Mary\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = Mozambique\n  | publisher = [[Lonely Planet]]\n  | year = 2007\n  | location =\n  | page = 33\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=DVvRHCBtS9sC\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn =1-74059-188-7 }}\n</ref>\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{See also|Portuguese cuisine|Cuisine of Mozambique|African cuisine}}\nWith a nearly 500-year presence in the country, the Portuguese have greatly influenced Mozambique's cuisine.

The use of spices and [[seasoning]]s such as [[Bay leaf|bay leaves]], [[chili pepper]]s, fresh [[coriander]], garlic, onions, [[paprika]], red sweet peppers, and wine were introduced by the Portuguese, as were maize, [[millet]], potatoes, rice, [[sorghum]], and [[sugarcane]].

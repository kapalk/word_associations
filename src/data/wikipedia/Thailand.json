({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e22\u0e32\u0e21}}), is a country at the center of the [[Southeast Asia]]n [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochinese peninsula]] composed of 76 [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]]. At {{convert|513,120|km2|abbr=on}} and over 68 million people, Thailand is the world's [[List of countries and dependencies by area|50th largest country by total area]] and the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|21st-most-populous country]]. The capital and largest city is [[Bangkok]], a special administrative area. Thailand is bordered to the north by [[Myanmar]] and [[Laos]], to the east by Laos and [[Cambodia]], to the south by the [[Gulf of Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]], and to the west by the [[Andaman Sea]] and the southern extremity of Myanmar. Its maritime boundaries include [[Vietnam]] in the Gulf of Thailand to the southeast, and [[Indonesia]] and [[India]] on the Andaman Sea to the southwest. Although nominally a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]], the most recent [[2014 Thai coup d'\u00e9tat|coup in 2014]] established a [[de facto]] [[military dictatorship]].\n\n[[Tai peoples]] migrated from southwestern China to mainland [[Southeast Asia]] from the 11th century; the oldest known mention of their presence in the region by the [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] ''Siamese'' dates to the 12th century. Various [[Indianised kingdoms]] such as the [[Mon kingdoms|Mon]], the [[Khmer Empire]] and [[Monarchies of Malaysia|Malay states]] ruled the region, competing with Thai states such as [[Ngoenyang]], the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]], [[Lan Na]] and the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom]], which rivaled each other. European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, one of the great powers in the region. Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656\u201388), gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in 1767 [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u201367)|in a war with Burma]]. [[Taksin]] quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived [[Thonburi Kingdom]]. He was succeeded in 1782 by [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke]], the first monarch of the [[Chakri dynasty]] and founder of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]], which lasted into the early 20th century.\n\nThrough the 18th and 19th centuries, Siam faced pressure from France and the United Kingdom, including forced concessions of territory, but nevertheless it remained the only Southeast Asian country to avoid direct Western rule. Following a bloodless [[Siamese revolution of 1932|revolution in 1932]], Siam became a constitutional monarchy and changed its official name to \"Thailand\". While it joined the [[Allies (World War I)|Allies in World War I]], Thailand was an [[Thailand in World War II|Axis satellite]] in [[World War II]]. In the late 1950s, [[Sarit Thanarat|a military coup]] revived the monarchy's historically influential role in politics. Thailand became a [[Major non-NATO ally|major ally]] of the United States and played a [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|key anti-communist role in the region]]. Apart from a [[1973 Thai popular uprising|brief period of parliamentary democracy]] in the mid-1970s, Thailand has periodically alternated between democracy and military rule. In the 21st century, Thailand endured a political crisis that culminated in two coups and the establishment of its [[Constitution of Thailand#2017 Constitution|current and 20th constitution]] by the military junta.\n\nThailand  is a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] under a [[Military dictatorship|military junta]]. Thailand is a founding member of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] and remains a major ally of the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/usmu003.asp|title=American foreign policy. 1950-1955; basic documents|website=avalon.law.yale.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2321k|title=22 U.S. Code \u00a7 2321k - Designation of major non-NATO allies|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> Despite its comparatively sporadic changes in leadership, it is considered a [[regional power]] in Southeast Asia and a [[middle power]] in global affairs.<ref>Jonathan H.

The domains of Tai people existed from the northeast of present-day India to the north of present-day Laos and to the [[Malay peninsula]]. During the 13th century, Tai people have already settled in the core land of [[Dvaravati]] and [[Lavo Kingdom]] to [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]] in the south. There are, however, no records detailing the arrival of the Tais. Around 1240s, [[Si Inthrathit|Pho Khun Bang Klang Hao]], a local Tai ruler, rallied the people to rebel against the Khmer. He later crowned himself the first king of [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in 1238. Mainstream Thai historians count Sukhothai as the first kingdom of Thai people. Sukhothai expanded furthest during the reign of [[Ram Khamhaeng]] (1279\u201398). However, it was mostly a network of local lords who swore fealty to Sukhothai, not directly controlled by it. He is believed to invent [[Thai script]] and Thai ceramics was an important export goods in his era. Sukhothai embraced [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] in the reign of [[Maha Thammaracha I]] (1347\u201368).\n\nTo the north, [[Mangrai]] who descended from a local ruler linage of [[Ngoenyang]], founded the kingdom of [[Lan Na]] in 1292, centered in [[Chiang Mai]]. He unified the surrounding area and his dynasty would rule the kingdom continuously for the next two centuries. He also created a network of state through political alliance to the east and north of [[Mekong]]. While in the port in Lower Chao Phraya Basin, a federation around [[Phetchaburi]], [[Suphan Buri]], [[Lopburi]] and [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] area was created in the 11th century.\n\n=== Ayutthaya Kingdom ===\n\n{{Main|Ayutthaya Kingdom|Thonburi Kingdom}}\n\n[[File:Southeast Asian history - Around 1540.png|alt=Southeast Asia around 1540|left|thumb|Ayutthaya's zone of influence and neighbours, c. 1540]]\nAccording to the most widely accepted version of its origin, Ayutthaya Kingdom rose from the earlier, nearby [[Lavo Kingdom]] and Suvarnabhumi with [[Uthong]] as its first king. Ayutthaya was a patchwork of self-governing principalities and tributary provinces owing allegiance to the king of Ayutthaya under [[Mandala (political model)|mandala system]]. Its initial expansion is through conquest and political marriage. Before the end of the 15th century, Ayutthaya invaded Khmer Empire twice and sacked its capital [[Angkor]]. Ayutthaya then became a regional great power in place of Khmer Empire. Constant interference of Sukhothai effectively made it a vassal state of Ayutthaya and was finally incorporated in to the kingdom. [[Borommatrailokkanat]] brought about bureaucratic reforms which lasted into the 20th century and created a system of social hierarchy called ''[[Sakdina]]'', where common male was conscripted into [[corv\u00e9e]] for six months a year. Ayutthaya was interested in [[Malay peninsula]] but failed to conquer [[Malacca Sultanate]] which was supported by Chinese [[Ming Dynasty]].\n\nEuropean contact and trade started in the early 16th century, with the [[Duarte Fernandes|envoy]] of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] duke [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1511, followed by the French, Dutch, and English. Rivalry for supremacy over Chiang Mai and Mon people pitted Ayutthaya against Burmese Kingdom. Multiple war with its ruling dynasty [[Taungoo Dynasty]] starting in the 1540s in the reign of [[Tabinshwehti]] and [[Bayinnaung]] were ultimately ended with [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1568\u201370)|capture of the capital in 1570]]. Then was a period of brief vassalage to Burma until [[Naresuan]] proclaimed independence in 1584.\n\n[[File:AMH-5626-NA Bird's eye view of the city of Judja.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Johannes Vingboons]] of Ayutthaya, c. 1665]]\nAyutthaya then seek to improve relations with European powers for many successive reigns. The kingdom especially prospered during cosmopolitan [[Narai]]'s reign (1656\u201388) where some European travelers regarded Ayutthaya as Asian great powers alongside China and India.<ref name=\"chris\"/>{{rp|ix}} However, growing French influence later in his reign was met with nationalist sentiment and led eventually to the [[Siamese revolution of 1688|revolution of 1688]]. However, overall relations remain stable with French missionaries still active in preaching Christianity.\n\nAfter that, there was a period of relative peace but the kingdom's influence gradually waned, partly because of bloody struggles over each succession, until the capital Ayutthaya was [[Burmese\u2013Siamese War (1765\u201367)|utterly destroyed in 1767]] by Burma's new [[Alaungpaya]] dynasty. Anarchy followed destruction of the former capital, with its territories split into five different factions, each controlled by a warlord. [[Taksin]] rose to power and proclaimed [[Thonburi]] as temporary capital in the same year. He also quickly subdued the other warlords. His forces engaged in wars with Burma, Laos, and Cambodia, which successfully drove the Burmese out of Lan Na in 1775, captured [[Vientiane]] in 1778 and tried to install a pro-Thai king in Cambodia in the 1770s. In his final years there was a coup which was caused by his supposedly \"insanity,\" and eventually Taksin and his sons were executed by longtime companion General [[Rama I|Chao Phraya Chakri]] (future Rama I). He was the first king of the ruling [[Chakri Dynasty]] and founder of [[Bangkok]] ([[Rattanakosin Kingdom]]) on April 6, 1782.\n\n=== Modernization and centralization ===\n{{Main|Rattanakosin Kingdom}}\n[[File:ThailandWithFlags.gif|thumb|Siamese territorial concessions to Britain and France by year]]\n\nUnder [[Rama I]] (1782\u20131809), Rattanakosin successfully defended against Burmese attacks and put an end to Burmese invasion.

Vientiane was destroyed and a large number of Lao people was relocated to [[Khorat Plateau]] as the result. Bangkok also waged [[Siamese\u2013Vietnamese wars|multiple wars with Vietnam]], where Bangkok successfully regained influence over Cambodia.\n\n[[File:King and Tsar.jpg|210px|thumb|left|King [[Chulalongkorn]] with Tsar [[Nicholas II]] in Saint Petersburg, during his first Grand Tour in 1897]]\n\nSince the late 19th century, Siam tried to subdue the ethnic groups in the realm as colony. In the reign of [[Mongkut]] (1851\u201368), who recognized the threat of Western powers, the court contacted the British government directly to defuse the tension. A British mission led by Sir [[John Bowring]], Governor of Hong Kong, led to the conclusion of [[Bowring Treaty]], first of many [[Unequal treaty|unequal treaties]] with Western countries. It, however, brought economic development in Bangkok and international trade. The unexpected death of Mongkut by [[malaria]] led to succession by young [[Chulalongkorn|Prince Chulalongkorn]] and [[Somdet Chaophraya Sri Suriwongse]] (Chuang Bunnag) acted as a regent.\n\nChulalongkorn (r. 1868\u20131910) initiated centralization, set up a privy council, and abolished slavery and [[corv\u00e9e]] system. [[Front Palace crisis]] of 1874 stalled reformation attempt. In the 1870s and 1880s, he incorporated the protectorate up north into the kingdom proper, which later expanded to the protectorate in the northeast and the south. He established twelve ''krom'' in 1888, which was equivalent to present-day ministries. [[Franco-Siamese War|Crisis of 1893]] which was caused by French demands of Laotian territory east of Mekong. France and Britain agreed between themselves to make Siam [[buffer state]]. It was not until the 20th century can Siam renegotiate every unequal treaty since Bowring treaty, including [[extraterritoriality]], but had to pay with many territorial exchanges. The advent of monthon system marked the creation of modern nation-state. In 1905, there was rebellions in ancient Pattani area, Ubon Ratchathani and Phrae to oppose an attempt to subdue the power of local ruling lords.\n\n[[Palace Revolt of 1912]] was a failed attempt by Western-educated military officers who aimed to overthrow absolute monarchy. [[Vajiravudh]] (r. 1910\u201325) responded by propaganda for the entirety of his reign. He promoted the [[Thaification|idea of Thai nation]]. In 1917, Siam joined [[World War I]] on the side of [[Allies of World War I|the Allies]] because there were concerns that the Allies may react to neutral countries and desire to amend past unequal treaties. In the aftermath Siam joined [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], gained freedom of taxation and cancellation of extraterritoriality.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy, World War II, and Cold War ===\n{{Main|Thailand in World War II|History of Thailand (1932\u201373)}}\nThe [[Siamese revolution of 1932|bloodless revolution]] took place in 1932, carried out by the [[Khana Ratsadon]] group of military and civilian officials resulted in a transition of power, when [[Prajadhipok]] was forced to grant the people of Siam their first constitution, thereby ending centuries of [[absolute monarchy]]. It was the combined results of economic hardship felt by the [[Great Depression]], sharply fell rice price and significantly reduction in public spending causing discontent among aristocrats. In 1933, [[Boworadet rebellion|A counter-revolutionary rebellion]] occurred which aimed to reinstate absolute monarchy but failed. Prajadhipok's conflict with the government eventually led to abdication. The government selected [[Ananda Mahidol]], who was studying in Switzerland, to be the new king.\n\nLater that decade, the military wing of Khana Ratsadon came to dominate Siamese politics. [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] who became premier in 1938, started political oppression and took openly anti-royalist stance. His government adopted nationalism and Westernization, anti-Chinese and anti-French policies. In 1940, there was a decree changing the name of the country from \"Siam\" to \"Thailand.\" In 1941, Thailand was in [[French\u2013Thai War|a brief conflict]] with [[Vichy France]] resulting in Thailand gained Laotian and Cambodian territories until the war ends. On December 8, 1941 Japan invaded Thailand and the government quickly agreed to join military alliance with Japan. The government also declare war on the United States and the United Kingdom. [[Free Thai Movement]] was launched both in Thailand and abroad to oppose the government and Japanese occupation. After the war ends in 1945 Thailand signed formal agreement to end the state of war with [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]]. Most Allied powers did not recognize Thailand's declaration of war.\n\n[[File:King Rama IX being presented with regalia at coronation.jpg|thumb|150px|Coronation of King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]].]]\nIn June 1946, young King Ananda was found dead under mysterious circumstances. His younger brother [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] succeeded the throne. Thailand signed [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) to became an active ally of the United States since 1954. Field Marshal [[Sarit Thanarat]] launched a coup in 1957, which removed Khana Ratsadon from politics. His rule was autocratic; he built his legitimacy around the god-like status of the monarch and by channeling the government's loyalty to the king. His government improved the country's infrastructure and education. After the US joined [[Vietnam War]] in 1961, there was a secret agreement where the US promised to protect Thailand.\n\nThe period brought about increasing [[modernisation]] and [[Westernisation]]. Internal conflict regarding economic difficulties which began in 1968 led to [[1973 Thai popular uprising]], an important event in Thai modern history.\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\n{{Main|History of Thailand (1973\u20132001)|History of Thailand since 2001}}\n\nConstant unrest and instability, as well as fear of communist takeover after [[Fall of Saigon]], made some ultra-right groups brand increasingly leftist students as communists. This culminated in [[Thammasat University massacre]] in October 1976. A coup d'\u00e9tat on that very day brought Thailand a new ultra-right government, which oppressed many media outlets, officials, and intellectuals, and fueled the [[Communist insurgency in Thailand|Communist insurgency]] further. Another coup in the following year installed a more moderate government, which offered amnesty to communist fighters in 1978. The Party abandoned the insurgency by 1983.

The northeast, [[Isan]], consists of the [[Khorat Plateau]], bordered to the east by the [[Mekong River]].

It contributes to the tourism sector owing to its clear shallow waters along the coasts in the southern region and the Kra Isthmus.

The idea has been greeted positively by Thai politicians as it would cut fees charged by the [[Port of Singapore|Ports of Singapore]], improve ties with China and India, lower shipping times, and eliminate pirate attacks in the [[Strait of Malacca]], and support the Thai government's policy of being the logistical hub for Southeast Asia. The canal, it is claimed, would improve economic conditions in the south of Thailand, which relies heavily on tourism income, and it would also change the structure of the Thai economy by making it an Asia logistical hub.

There are also two specially-governed districts: the capital [[Bangkok]] (Krung Thep Maha Nakhon) and [[Pattaya]]. Bangkok is at provincial level and thus often counted as a province.\n\nEach province is divided into [[amphoe|districts]] and the districts are further divided into sub-districts (tambons). {{As of|2017}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://multi.dopa.go.th/pab/news/cate9/view46|title=Statistics of Administrative Divisions, Provincial Affairs Bureau|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> there were 878 [[Amphoe|districts (\u0e2d\u0e33\u0e40\u0e20\u0e2d, amphoe)]] and the 50 [[districts of Bangkok]] ({{lang|th|\u0e40\u0e02\u0e15}}, khet), which is further divided into 7,255 [[Tambon|subdistricts ({{lang|th|\u0e15\u0e33\u0e1a\u0e25}}, tambon)]] in the 76 provinces or [[Khwaeng|Bangkok's subdistricts (\u0e41\u0e02\u0e27\u0e07, khwaeng)]]. Some parts of the provinces bordering Bangkok are also referred to as [[Bangkok Metropolitan Area|Greater Bangkok]] ({{lang|th|\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e13\u0e11\u0e25}}, pari monthon). These provinces include [[Nonthaburi Province|Nonthaburi]], [[Pathum Thani Province|Pathum Thani]], [[Samut Prakan Province|Samut Prakan]], [[Nakhon Pathom Province|Nakhon Pathom]] and [[Samut Sakhon Province|Samut Sakhon]]. The name of each province's capital city ({{lang|th|\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07}}, mueang) is the same as that of the province. For example, the capital of Chiang Mai Province (''Changwat Chiang Mai'') is ''Mueang Chiang Mai'' or ''Chiang Mai''.\n{{Provinces of Thailand Image Map}}\n\n=== Regions ===\n[[File:Thailand four regions.svg|thumb|Thailand four-region division]]\n{{Main|Regions of Thailand}}\nThai provinces are administrated by regions. The regions that Thailand uses to divide the provinces is the four-region division system. It divides the country into the four regions:\n[[Northern Thailand]], [[Northeastern Thailand]], [[Central Thailand]]\nand [[Southern Thailand]]. Each region has its own different historical background, culture, language and people.\n\nIn contrast to the [[administrative division]]s of the [[Provinces of Thailand]], Thailand is a [[Unitary state]], the provincial Governors, district chiefs, and district clerks are appointed by the central government. The regions themselves do not have an administrative character, but are used for [[geography of Thailand|geographical]], [[Statistics|statistical]], [[geology|geological]], [[meteorology|meteorological]] or [[tourism|touristic]] purposes.\n\n=== Southern region ===\n{{See also|South Thailand insurgency}}\n[[File:Souththailandmap.GIF|thumb|left|Southern provinces of Thailand showing the Malay-Muslim majority areas]]\n\nThailand controlled the [[Malay Peninsula]] as far south as Malacca in the 15th century and held much of the peninsula, including Temasek (Singapore), some of the [[Andaman Islands]], and a colony on [[Java]], but eventually contracted when the British used force to guarantee their [[suzerainty]] over the sultanate.\n\nMostly the northern states of the Malay Sultanate presented annual gifts to the Thai king in the form of a [[Bunga mas|golden flower]]\u2014a gesture of tribute and an acknowledgement of vassalage. The British intervened in the Malay State and with the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909|Anglo-Siamese Treaty]] tried to build a railway from the south to Bangkok. Thailand relinquished sovereignty over what are now the northern Malay provinces of [[Kedah]], [[Perlis]], [[Kelantan]], and [[Terengganu]] to the British. Satun and Pattani Provinces were given to Thailand.\n\nThe Malay peninsular provinces were occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and infiltrated by the [[Malayan Communist Party]] (CPM) from 1942 to 2008, when they sued for peace with the Malaysian and Thai governments after the CPM lost its support from [[Vietnam]] and China subsequent to the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Recent insurgent uprisings may be a continuation of separatist fighting which started after World War II with Sukarno's support for the [[Patani United Liberation Organisation|PULO]].  Most victims since the uprisings have been Buddhist and Muslim bystanders.\n\n== Foreign relations ==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Thailand}}\n[[File:Rama IX of Thailand and Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|King [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] in a meeting with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], 18 November 2012]]\n[[File:Royal Thai Embassy Wellington New Zealand 2015.JPG|thumb|Royal Thai Embassy in [[Wellington]], [[New Zealand]]]]\nThe foreign relations of Thailand are handled by the Minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThailand participates fully in international and regional organisations. It is a [[major non-NATO ally]] and Priority Watch List [[Special 301 Report]] of the United States. The country remains an active member of ASEAN [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. Thailand has developed increasingly close ties with other ASEAN members: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Vietnam, whose foreign and economic ministers hold annual meetings. Regional co-operation is progressing in economic, trade, banking, political, and cultural matters. In 2003, Thailand served as [[Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]] (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) host. Dr. Supachai Panitchpakdi, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand, currently serves as Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). In 2005 Thailand attended the inaugural East Asia Summit.\n\nIn recent years, Thailand has taken an increasingly active role on the international stage. When [[East Timor]] gained independence from Indonesia, Thailand, for the first time in its history, contributed troops to the international peacekeeping effort. Its troops remain there today as part of a UN peacekeeping force. As part of its effort to increase international ties, Thailand has reached out to such regional organisations as the Organization of American States (OAS) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Thailand has contributed troops to reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nThaksin initiated negotiations for several [[free trade agreement]]s with China, Australia, Bahrain, India, and the US.

In 1997 increased pressure on the [[Thai baht|baht]], a year in which the economy contracted by 1.9%, led to a crisis that uncovered financial sector weaknesses and forced the [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] administration to [[Floating exchange rate|float the currency]]. Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh was forced to resign after his cabinet came under fire for its slow response to the economic crisis. The baht was pegged at 25 to the US dollar from 1978 to 1997. The baht reached its lowest point of 56 to the US dollar in January 1998 and the economy contracted by 10.8% that year, triggering the [[Asian financial crisis]].\n\nThailand's economy started to recover in 1999, expanding 4.2\u20134.4% in 2000, thanks largely to strong exports. Growth (2.2%) was dampened by the softening of the global economy in 2001, but picked up in the subsequent years owing to strong growth in Asia, a relatively weak baht encouraging exports, and increased domestic spending as a result of several mega projects and incentives of Prime Minister [[Thaksin Shinawatra]], known as [[Thaksinomics]]. Growth in 2002, 2003, and 2004 was 5\u20137% annually.\n\nGrowth in 2005, 2006, and 2007 hovered around 4\u20135%. Due both to the weakening of the US dollar and an increasingly strong Thai currency, by March 2008 the dollar was hovering around the 33 baht mark. While Thaksinomics has received criticism, official economic data reveals that between 2001 and 2011, Isan's GDP per capita more than doubled to US$1,475, while, over the same period, GDP in the Bangkok area increased from US$7,900 to nearly US$13,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Thai northeast vows poll payback to Shinawatra clan|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iMeE4IHFr1q7Rr-eX5J1UmL3gcZQ?docId=b69c47e3-e4f5-4c32-8679-3d7ce5f040a3|accessdate=8 February 2014|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=31 January 2014|author=Aidan Jones}}</ref>\n\nWith the instability surrounding major 2010 protests, the GDP growth of Thailand settled at around 4\u20135%, from highs of 5\u20137% under the previous civilian administration. Political uncertainty was identified as the primary cause of a decline in investor and consumer confidence. The IMF predicted that the Thai economy would rebound strongly from the low 0.1% GDP growth in 2011, to 5.5% in 2012 and then 7.5% in 2013, due to the monetary policy of the Bank of Thailand, as well as a package of fiscal stimulus measures introduced by the former [[Yingluck Shinawatra]] government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |title=Thailand Economy To Rebound Strongly In 2012 |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=26 April 2012 |author=Phisanu Phromchanya |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015133916/http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203960804577243432046066486 |archivedate=15 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Thai military coup of 22 May 2014, the AFP global news agency published an article that claimed that the nation was on the verge of recession.

These reforms implemented an agenda of increased privatization and trade liberalization in the country, and decreased federal subsidization of public goods and utilities, agricultural price supports, and regulations on fair wages and labor conditions.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Guille|first=Howard|date=2014|title=Reforming Asian Labor Systems: Economic Tensions and Worker Dissent|url=|journal=Asian Studies Review|volume=39|pages=|via=}}</ref> These changes put further pressure on the agricultural sector, and prompted continued migration from the rural countryside to the growing cities. Many migrant farmers found work in Thailand's growing manufacturing industry, and took jobs in sweatshops and factories with few labor regulations and often exploitative conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipedr.com/vol4/89-F10110.pdf|title=The Role of Informal Sector in Thailand|last=Warunsiri|first=Sasiwimon|date=2011|website=Research Institute for Policy Evaluation and Design|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThose that could not find formal factory work, including illegal migrants and the families of rural Thai migrants that followed their relatives to the urban centers, turned to the informal sector to provide the extra support needed for survival\u2014under the widespread regulation imposed by the structural adjustment programs, one family member working in a factory or sweatshop made very little. Scholars argue that the economic consequences and social costs of Thailand's labor reforms in the wake of the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis fell on individuals and families rather than the state. This can be described as the \"externalization of market risk\", meaning that as the country's labor market became increasingly deregulated, the burden and responsibility of providing an adequate livelihood shifted from employers and the state to the workers themselves, whose families had to find jobs in the informal sector to make up for the losses and subsidize the wages being made by their relatives in the formal sector. The weight of these economic changes hit migrants and the urban poor especially hard, and the informal sector expanded rapidly as a result.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nToday, informal labor in Thailand is typically broken down into three main groups: subcontracted/self employed/home-based workers, service workers (including those that are employed in restaurants, as street vendors, masseuses, taxi drivers, and as domestic workers), and agricultural workers. Not included in these categories are those that work in entertainment, nightlife, and the sex industry. Individuals employed in these facets of the informal labor sector face additional vulnerabilities, including recruitment into circles of sexual exploitation and human trafficking.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn general, education levels are low in the informal sector. A 2012 study found that 64% of informal workers had not completed education beyond primary school. Many informal workers are also migrants, only some of which have legal status in the country. Education and citizenship are two main barriers to entry for those looking to work in formal industries, and enjoy the labor protections and social security benefits that come along with formal employment. Because the informal labor sector is not recognized under the Labor Protection Act (LPA), informal workers are much more vulnerable labor to exploitation and unsafe working conditions than those employed in more formal and federally recognized industries. While some Thai labor laws provide minimal protections to domestic and agricultural workers, they are often weak and difficult to enforce. Furthermore, Thai social security policies fail to protect against the risks many informal workers face, including workplace accidents and compensation as well as unemployment and retirement insurance. Many informal workers are not legally contracted for their employment, and many do not make a living wage.<ref name=\":2\" /> As a result, labor trafficking is common in the region, affecting children and adults, men and women, and migrants and Thai citizens alike.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Thailand}}\n{{clear}}\n[[File:Bev\u00f6lkerungspyramide Thailand 2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid 2016]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population in Thailand{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|20.7\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000 ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|62.9\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}} ||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Thailand}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|}\n\nThailand had a population of {{UN_Population|Thailand}}{{UN_Population|ref}} {{As of|{{UN_Population|Year}}|lc=y}}.

Thailand's national religion, Theravada Buddhism, is central to modern Thai identity. [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhism]] has evolved over time to include many regional beliefs originating from [[Hinduism]], [[animism]], as well as ancestor worship. The [[Thai solar calendar|official calendar]] in Thailand is based on the Eastern version of the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]] (BE), which is 543 years ahead of the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian (Western) calendar]].

The elder may then respond in the same way. Social status and position, such as in government, will also have an influence on who performs the ''wai'' first. For example, although one may be considerably older than a provincial governor, when meeting it is usually the visitor who pays respect first. When children leave to go to school, they are taught to ''wai'' their parents to indicate their respect. The wai is a sign of respect and reverence for another, similar to the [[namaste]] greeting of India and Nepal.\n\nAs with other Asian cultures, respect towards ancestors is an essential part of Thai spiritual practice. Thais have a strong sense of hospitality and generosity, but also a strong sense of social hierarchy. Seniority is paramount in Thai culture. Elders have by tradition ruled in family decisions or ceremonies. Older siblings have duties to younger ones.\n\nTaboos in Thailand include touching someone's head or pointing with the feet, as the head is considered the most sacred and the foot the lowest part of the body.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Further|Cuisine of Thailand}}\n[[File:Thai vegetable carving.jpg|thumb|The art of [[vegetable carving]] is thought to have originated in the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] nearly 700 years ago<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thaicarving.co.uk/php/history.php |title=The History of Thai Fruit and Vegetable Carving |accessdate=2014-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125120930/http://www.thaicarving.co.uk/php/history.php |archivedate=25 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\n\n[[Cuisine of Thailand|Thai cuisine]] blends five fundamental tastes: sweet, spicy, sour, bitter, and salty.

Many large businesses in Bangkok operate in English as well as other languages.\n\nThailand is the largest newspaper market in Southeast Asia with an estimated circulation of over 13 million copies daily in 2003. Even upcountry, out of Bangkok, the media flourish. For example, according to Thailand's Public Relations Department Media Directory 2003\u20132004, the nineteen provinces of [[Isan]], Thailand's northeastern region, hosted 116 newspapers along with radio, TV, and cable. Since then, another province, Bueng Kan, was incorporated, totalling twenty provinces. In addition, a military coup on 22 May 2014 led to severe state restrictions on all media and forms of expression.\n\n=== Units of measurement ===\n{{Further|Thai units of measurement}}\nThailand generally uses the [[metric system]], but [[Thai units of measurement|traditional units of measurement]] for land area are used, and [[imperial units]] of measurement are occasionally used for building materials, such as wood and plumbing fixtures. Years are numbered as B.E. ([[Thai solar calendar|Buddhist Era]]) in educational settings, civil service, government, contracts, and newspaper datelines.

They have won the [[Asian Women's Volleyball Championship|Asian Championship]] twice and [[AVC Cup for Women|Asian Cup]] once. By the success of the women's team, the [[Thailand men's national volleyball team|men team]] has been growing as well.\n\n[[Takraw]] (Thai: \u0e15\u0e30\u0e01\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d) is a sport native to Thailand, in which the players hit a rattan ball and are only allowed to use their feet, knees, chest, and head to touch the ball. [[Sepak takraw]] is a form of this sport which is similar to volleyball. The players must volley a ball over a net and force it to hit the ground on the opponent's side. It is also a popular sport in other countries in Southeast Asia. A rather similar game but played only with the feet is [[buka ball]].\n\n[[Snooker]] has enjoyed increasing popularity in Thailand in recent years, with interest in the game being stimulated by the success of Thai snooker player [[James Wattana]] in the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hodgson |first=Guy |date=18 April 1993 |title=Snooker: A storm coming in from the East: Thailand doesn't boast many world-beating sportsmen.

The success in sports like [[powerlifting|weightlifting]] and [[taekwondo]] at the last two summer Olympic Games has demonstrated that boxing is no longer the only medal option for Thailand.\n\n=== Sporting venues ===\nThammasat Stadium is a multi-purpose stadium in Bangkok. It is currently used mostly for football matches. The stadium holds 25,000. It is on Thammasat University's Rangsit campus. It was built for the [[1998 Asian Games]] by construction firm Christiani and Nielsen, the same company that constructed the Democracy Monument in Bangkok.\n\n[[Rajamangala National Stadium]] is the biggest sporting arena in Thailand. It currently has a capacity of 65,000. It is in Bang Kapi, Bangkok. The stadium was built in 1998 for the 1998 Asian Games and is the home stadium of the [[Thailand national football team]].\n\nThe well-known Lumpini Boxing Stadium will host its final Muay Thai boxing matches on 7 February 2014 after the venue first opened in December 1956. Managed by the Royal Thai Army, the stadium was officially selected for the purpose of muay Thai bouts following a competition that was staged on 15 March 1956. From 11 February 2014, the stadium will relocate to Ram Intra Road, due to the new venue's capacity to accommodate audiences of up to 3,500. Foreigners typically pay between 1,000\u20132,000 baht to view a match, with prices depending on the location of the seating.<ref>{{cite news|title=End of an era for Muay Thai at Lumpini|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/393517/end-of-an-era-as-lumpini-boxing-stadium-closes-its-doors-on-friday|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=6 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n== International rankings ==\n{{Main|International rankings of Thailand}}\n\n==National identity==\nThe Fisheries Department is promoting ''pla gud'', or Siamese fighting fish, as the national fish. Department chief Adisorn Promthep said that the proposal will be submitted to the National Identity Office under the Prime Minister's Office for approval. He said that once the status is recognised, fighting fish farming would be promoted which would generate money and create jobs. He added that credible records show that ''pla gud'' of the ''[[Betta splendens]]'' species are native to Thailand and were first collected for fighting during the reign of King [[Rama III]].<ref>{{cite news |title='Pla gud' to be national fish |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1570858/pla-gud-to-be-national-fish |accessdate=6 November 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=6 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Thailand|Asia}}\n* [[Index of Thailand-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Thailand]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=C\u0153d\u00e8s|first= George|authorlink= George C\u0153d\u00e8s|editor= Walter F.

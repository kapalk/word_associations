In 1856, southern Bessarabia was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]], but Russian rule was restored over the whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]], Bessarabia briefly became autonomous and then the independent [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] until it was integrated into [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] in 1918 following a vote of its assembly. The decision was disputed by [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], which in 1924 allowed the establishment, within the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]], of a [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian autonomous republic]] (MASSR) on partial Moldovan-inhabited territories to the east of the [[Dniester]]. In 1940, as a consequence of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], Romania was compelled to cede Bessarabia to the [[Soviet Union]], leading to the creation of the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (Moldavian SSR), which included the greater part of Bessarabia and the westernmost strip of the former MASSR.\n\nOn 27 August 1991, as the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] was under way, the Moldavian SSR [[Moldovan Declaration of Independence|declared independence]] and took the name Moldova. The [[Constitution of Moldova]] was adopted in 1994. The strip of the Moldovan territory on the east bank of the Dniester river has been under the ''[[de facto]]'' control of the breakaway government of [[Transnistria]] since 1990.\n\nDue to a decrease in industrial and agricultural output following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the [[service sector]] has grown to dominate [[Economy of Moldova|Moldova's economy]] and is over 60% of the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]].

Between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, the south was intermittently under the [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and then [[Byzantine Empire]]s. Due to its strategic location on a route between Asia and Europe, the territory of modern Moldova was invaded many times in late antiquity and the [[early Middle Ages]], including by [[Goths]], [[Huns]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Magyars]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]], [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongols]] and [[Mongol and Tatar states in Europe|Tatars]].\n\nFriar [[William of Rubruck]], who visited the court of the Great Khan in the 1250s, listed \"the Blac\",<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|2009|p=139}}</ref> or Vlachs, among the peoples who paid tribute to the Mongols, but the Vlachs' territory is uncertain.{{sfn|S\u0103l\u0103gean|2005|p=196}}{{sfn|Spinei|1986|p=131}} Rubruck described \"Blakia\" as \"[[Asen dynasty|Assan's]] territory\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Jackson|2009|p=30}}</ref> south of the Lower Danube, showing that he [[Bulgarian lands across the Danube|identified it with the northern regions]] of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]].{{sfn|V\u00e1s\u00e1ry|2005|p=30}}\n\nThe [[Bolokhoveni|Bolohoveni]], a [[Vlachs|Vlach population]], is mentioned by the [[Hypatian Chronicle]] in the 13th century. The chronicle shows that this land is bordered on the principalities of [[Halych]], [[Volhynia]] and [[Kiev]]. Archaeological research also identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region. Alexandru V.

Drago\u0219 established a [[polity]] there as a vassal to the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 1350s. The independence of the [[Principality]] of [[Moldavia]] was gained when [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan I]], another Vlach voivode from Maramure\u0219 who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359 and took control of Moldavia, wresting the region from Hungary. The Principality of [[Moldavia]] was bounded by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, the [[Dniester]] River in the east, and the Danube River and [[Black Sea]] to the south. Its territory comprised the present-day territory of the Republic of Moldova, the [[Western Moldavia|eastern eight counties]] of Romania, and parts of the [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] and [[Budjak]] region of Ukraine. Like the present-day republic and Romania's north-eastern region, it was known to the locals as ''Moldova''.\n\n===Between Poland and Hungary===\n[[File:Polska 1386 - 1434.png|thumb|right|200px|Map of the [[Kingdom of Poland]] and the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] between 1386 and 1434 showing the [[Principality of Moldavia]] as a Polish fief.]]\n\nThe history of what is today Moldova has been intertwined with that of Poland for centuries. The Polish chronicler [[Jan D\u0142ugosz]] mentioned Moldavians (under the name ''Wallachians'') as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw I the Elbow-high|W\u0142adys\u0142aw I]], against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].<ref>''The Annals of Jan D\u0142ugosz'', p. 273</ref> The Polish state was powerful enough to counter the [[Hungarian Kingdom]] which was consistently interested in bringing the area that would become Moldova into its political orbit.\n\nTies between Poland and Moldavia expanded after the founding of the Moldavian state by [[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], a Vlach [[voivode]] from [[Maramure\u0219]] who had fallen out with the Hungarian king. Crossing the [[Carpathian mountains]] in 1359, the voivode took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in creating Moldavia as an independent political entity. Despite being disfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[La\u021bcu of Moldavia|La\u021bcu]], the Moldavian ruler also likely allied himself with the Poles. La\u021bcu also accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences.\n\n[[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I]] profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o|W\u0142adys\u0142aw II]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Alb\u0103]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[Ghind\u0103oani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.\n\nAlthough [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), this ruler shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history.\n\n===The Ottomans===\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = Stefan cel Mare.jpg\n| width1    = 104\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = \n| image2    = \u0421\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c Cetatea Soroca Soroca Fortress (44738813601).jpg\n| width2    = 240\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = \n| image3    = The Soroca fortress.jpg\n| width3    = 200\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = \n| footer    = Built during the reign of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] ''(pictured above)'', several authors believed the [[Soroca Fort]] was constructed on the site of a former [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] fortress named ''Olhionia''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.istoria.md/articol/103/Cetatea_Soroca_a_Moldovei| title=Cetatea Soroca a Moldovei (1499 \u2013 prezent)|publisher=Istoria.md| last=Bulat| first=Nicolae| language=Romanian}}</ref>\n| footer_align = left\n}}\nFor all of his success, it was under the reign of Alexander I that the very first confrontation with the [[Ottoman Turks]] took place at Cetatea Alb\u0103 in 1420. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] and the ascension of [[Peter III Aaron]] in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[Alex\u0103ndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].\n\nDuring this time, Moldavia was invaded repeatedly by Crimean [[Tatars]] and, beginning in the 15th century, by the Turks. In 1538, the principality became a [[tribute|tributary]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]], but it retained internal and partial external autonomy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://countrystudies.us/moldova/3.htm|title=Moldova: Early History|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|date=June 1995|accessdate=26 April 2018}}</ref> In May 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] removed [[Ieremia Movil\u0103]] from Moldavia's throne by winning the battle of [[Bac\u0103u]], briefly reuniting under his rule [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]], and [[Transylvania]]. A Polish army led by [[Jan Zamoyski]] drove the Wallachians from Moldavia and reinstalled Ieremia Movil\u0103 to the throne, who put the country under the vassalage of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Moldavia finally returned to Ottoman vassalage in 1621.\n\nWhile [[Transnistria]] was never politically part of the Principality of Moldavia, there were sizable areas which were owned by Moldavian boyars and given by the Moldavian rulers.

[[Ruxandra Lupu]], the daughter of Moldavian voivode [[Vasile Lupu]] who married [[Tymish Khmelnytsky]], lived in [[Ra\u015fcov]] according to Ukrainian tradition.\n\nWhile most of today's Moldova came into the Ottoman orbit in the 16th century, a substantial part of [[Transnistria]] remained a part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793.\n\n===Modern history===\n\n====Russian Empire====\nIn accordance with the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1812|Treaty of Bucharest of 1812]], and despite numerous protests by Moldavian nobles on behalf of the sovereignty of their principality, the [[Ottoman Empire]] (of which Moldavia was a [[Vassal state|vassal]]) ceded to the [[Russian Empire]] the [[Bessarabia|eastern half of the territory]] of the Principality of Moldavia along with [[Khotyn]] and old Bessarabia (modern [[Budjak]]), which Russia had already conquered and annexed. The new Russian province was called [[Bessarabia Governorate|Oblast of Moldavia and Bessarabia]], and initially enjoyed a large degree of autonomy. After 1828 this autonomy was progressively restricted and in 1871 the Oblast was transformed into the Bessarabia Governorate, in a process of [[Forced assimilation|state-imposed assimilation]], [[Russification]]. As part of this process, the [[Tsarist]] administration in Bessarabia gradually removed the [[Romanian language]] from official and religious use.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://depts.washington.edu/cartah/text_archive/clark/bc_10.shtml#bc_10| title=Bessarabia, Chapter X: The Survival of Roumanian| first=Charles Upson| last=Clark| year=1927| publisher=Dodd, Mead & Company| website=Depts.washington.edu| accessdate=9 October 2013| quote=Naturally, this system resulted not in acquisition of Russian by the Moldavians, but in their almost complete illiteracy in any language.}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Treaty of Paris (1856)]] returned the southern part of Bessarabia (later organised as the [[Cahul County|Cahul]], Bolgrad and Ismail counties) to Moldavia, which remained an autonomous principality and, in 1859, [[Moldavia and Wallachia|united]] with [[Wallachia]] to form [[United Principalities|Romania]].

As a part of an ambitious economic liberalization effort, Moldova introduced a convertible currency, liberalized all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises, backed steady land privatization, removed export controls, and liberalized interest rates. The government entered into agreements with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to promote growth. \nThe economy reversed from decline in late 90's. Since 1999 the GDP (PPP) has had a steady growth as follows:<ref name=\"CIA_World_Factbook_Moldova\"/><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.indexmundi.com/g/g.aspx?c=md&v=65| title=Moldova \u2013 GDP (purchasing power parity) \u2013 Historical Data Graphs per Year| website=Indexmundi.com}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! 2005 !! 2006 !! 2007 !! 2008 !! 2009 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 !! 2014 !! 2015\n|-\n|8.41% || 9.07% || 9.76% || 10.67% || 10.13% || 10.99% || 6.80% || \u22120.70% || 8.90% || 1.80% || \u22121.10%\n|}\n\nAlthough estimates point to possible modest overvaluation of the real exchange rate, external competitiveness appears broadly adequate as reflected in strong sustained export performance.<ref name=\"imf.org\">{{cite press release|format=PDF |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2014/cr14190.pdf |title=2014 Article IV consultation and first post-program monitoring discussions \u2013 Staff report; press release; and statement by the Executive Director for the Republic of Moldova |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund|IMF]] |issue=IMF Country Report No. 14/190 |date=July 2014 |accessdate=2 September 2015}}</ref> However, the near-term economic outlook is weak. Main risks to the near-term outlook relate to serious vulnerabilities and governance issues in the banking sector, policy slippages in the run up to the elections, intensification of geopolitical tensions in the region, and a further slowdown in activity in main trading partners.\n\nMoldova remains highly vulnerable to fluctuations in remittances from workers abroad (24 percent of GDP), exports to the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and [[European Union]] (EU) (88 per cent of total exports), and donor support (about 10 per cent of government spending). The main transmission channels through which adverse exogenous shocks could impact the Moldovan economy are: remittances (also due to potentially returning migrants), external trade, and capital flows.\n\nMoldova largely achieved the main objectives of the combined ECF/EFF (IMF financial credit) supported program.

In line with FSAP recommendations, significant weaknesses in the legal and regulatory frameworks must be urgently addressed to ensure stability and soundness of the financial sector. Moldova has achieved a substantial degree of fiscal consolidation in recent years, but this trend is now reversing. Resisting pre-election pressures for selective spending increases and returning to the path of fiscal consolidation would reduce reliance on exceptionally-high donor support. Structural fiscal reforms would help safeguard sustainability.<ref name=\"imf.org\"/> Monetary policy has been successful in maintaining inflation within the NBM's target range. The implementation of structural reforms outlined in the National Development Strategy (NDS) Moldova 2020\u2014especially in the business environment, physical infrastructure, and human resources development areas\u2014would help boost potential growth and reduce poverty.<ref name=\"imf.org\"/> Moldova's remarkable recovery from the severe recession of 2009 was largely the result of sound macroeconomic and financial policies and structural reforms. Despite a small contraction in 2012, Moldova's economic performance was among the strongest in the region during 2010\u201313. Economic activity grew cumulatively by about 24 percent; consumer price inflation was brought under control; and real wages increased cumulatively by about 13 percent. This expansion was made possible by adequate macroeconomic stabilization measures and ambitious structural reforms implemented in the wake of the crisis under a Fund-supported program. In November 2013, Moldova initialed an Association Agreement with the EU which includes provisions establishing a [[Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area]] (DCFTA).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!The country\n!Average monthly salary (euro) 2018\n|-\n|Moldova<ref name=\"Monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html_2018-09-28\">{{Citation | url=https://monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html| title=Salariului mediu lunar pe economie in anul 2018 este de 6150 lei / Editorial / Monitorul fiscal FISC.md| newspaper=Monitorul.fisc.md/editorial/salariului-mediu-lunar-pe-economie-in-anul-2018-este-de-6150-lei.html| date= | author=| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|298\n|-\n|Romania<ref name=\"Mediafax_2018-08-07\">{{Citation | url=https://www.mediafax.ro/social/ins-salariul-mediu-pe-economie-in-crestere-in-iunie-17388668| title=INS: Salariul mediu pe economie, \u00een cre\u015ftere \u00een iunie| newspaper=Mediafax| date= 7 August 2018| author=Dan Straut| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|966\n|-\n|Ukraine<ref name=\"Index.minfin.com_2018-09-28\">{{Citation | url=https://index.minfin.com.ua/ua/labour/salary/average/2018-01| title=\u0421\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0431\u0456\u0442\u043d\u0430 \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 (\u0441\u0456\u0447\u0435\u043d\u044c 2018)| newspaper=Index.minfin.com| date= | author=| accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n|276\n|-\n|Russia<ref>[http://reconomica.ru/\u044d\u043a\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0438\u043a\u0430/\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0430/\u0441\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f-\u0437\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430-\u0432-\u0440\u0444-2018/ C\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0437\u0430\u0440\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f 2018]</ref>\n|534\n|}\n\nA political crisis in early 2013 led to policy slippages in the fiscal and financial areas. The political crisis that broke out in early 2013 was resolved with the appointment of a government supported by a pro-European center-right/center coalition in May 2013. However, delays in policy implementation prevented completion of the final reviews under the ECF/EFF arrangements.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[File:Moldova-chisineu-Mall-Dova.jpg|thumb|[[Malldova|MallDova]] shopping centre in Chi\u0219in\u0103u]]\nDespite a sharp decline in poverty in recent years, Moldova remains one of the poorest countries in Europe and structural reforms are needed to promote sustainable growth. Based on the Europe and Central Asia (ECA) regional poverty line of US$5/day (PPP), 55 percent of the population was poor in 2011. While this was significantly lower than 94 percent in 2002, Moldova's poverty rate is still more than double the ECA average of 25 percent. The NDS\u2014Moldova (National Development System) 2020, which was published in November 2012, focuses on several critical areas to boost economic development and reduce poverty. These include education, infrastructure, financial sector, business climate, energy consumption, pension system, and judicial framework. Following the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|regional financial crisis in 1998]], Moldova has made significant progress towards achieving and retaining macroeconomic and financial stabilization. It has, furthermore, implemented many structural and institutional reforms that are indispensable for the efficient functioning of a market economy. These efforts have helped maintain macroeconomic and financial stability under difficult external circumstances, enabled the resumption of economic growth and contributed to establishing an environment conducive to the economy's further growth and development in the medium term.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe government's goal of [[Moldova\u2013European Union relations|EU integration]] has resulted in some market-oriented progress. Moldova experienced better than expected economic growth in 2013 due to increased agriculture production, to economic policies adopted by the Moldovan government since 2009, and to the receipt of EU trade preferences connecting Moldovan products to the world's largest market.

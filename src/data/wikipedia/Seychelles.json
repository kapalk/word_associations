However, extinctions were far fewer than on islands such as [[Mauritius]] or [[Hawaii]], partly due to a shorter period of human occupation (since 1770). Seychelles today is known for success stories in protecting its flora and fauna. The rare [[Seychelles black parrot]], the national bird of the country, is now protected.\n\nThe granitic islands of Seychelles are home to about 75 endemic plant species, with a further 25 or so species in the [[Aldabra]] group. Particularly well-known is the [[coco de mer]], a species of palm that grows only on the islands of [[Praslin]] and neighbouring [[Curieuse]]. Sometimes nicknamed the \"love nut\" because the shape of its \"double\" coconut resembles buttocks, the coco-de-mer produces the world's heaviest seed. The [[jellyfish tree]] is to be found in only a few locations on [[Mah\u00e9, Seychelles|Mahe]]. This strange and ancient plant in a genus of its own (''[[Medusagyne]]'') seems to reproduce only in cultivation and not in the wild. Other unique plant species include Wright's gardenia (''[[Rothmannia annae]]'') found only on [[Aride Island]] Special Reserve.\n\nThe [[freshwater crab]] genus ''[[Seychellum]]'' is endemic to the granitic Seychelles, and a further 26 species of crabs and five species of [[hermit crab]]s live on the islands.<ref name=\"Haig\">{{cite book |author=Janet Haig|year=1984 |chapter=Land and freshwater crabs of the Seychelles and neighbouring islands |page=123 |editor=David Ross Stoddart |title=Biogeography and Ecology of the Seychelles Islands |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn=978-90-6193-107-2 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hAu6qogRHloC&pg=PA123}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Aldabra giant tortoise]] now populates many of the islands of Seychelles; the Aldabra population is the largest remaining. These unique reptiles can be found even in captive herds. The granitic islands of Seychelles may support distinct species of [[Seychelles giant tortoise]]s; the status of the different populations is currently unclear.\n\nThere are several unique species of orchid on the islands.\n\nSeychelles hosts some of the largest [[Bird colony|seabird colonies]] in the world, notably on the outer islands of Aldabra and Cosmoledo. In [[granitic Seychelles]] the largest colonies are on [[Aride Island]] including the world's largest numbers of two species. Sooty terns also breed on the islands. Other birds include Cattle egrets (''Bubulcus ibis'') and Fairy terns (''Gygis alba'').<ref>Attenborough, D. 1998.''The Life of Birds.'' p.220-221. BBC. {{ISBN|0563-38792-0}}</ref>\n\nThe marine life around the islands, especially the more remote coral islands, can be spectacular. More than 1,000 species of fish have been recorded.\n\n=== Environmental issues ===\nSince the use of [[speargun]]s and dynamite for fishing was banned through efforts of local conservationists in the 1960s, the wildlife is unafraid of [[Snorkeling|snorkelers]] and [[Scuba diving|divers]]. [[Coral bleaching]] in 1998 has damaged most reefs, but some reefs show healthy recovery (e.g., [[Silhouette Island]]).\n\nDespite huge disparities across nations,{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Seychelles claims to have achieved nearly all of its [[Millennium Development Goals]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/MDG/english/MDG%20Country%20Reports/Seychelles/Seychelles%20MDR2010Print.pdf|title=Seychelles Millennium Development Goals: Status Report 2010|last=|first=|date=August 2010|website=[[United Nations Development Programme]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181029044444/http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/MDG/english/MDG%20Country%20Reports/Seychelles/Seychelles%20MDR2010Print.pdf|archive-date=29 October 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref> 17 MDGS and 169 targets have been achieved.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Environmental protection is becoming a cultural value.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nTheir government's Seychelles Climate Guide describes the nation's climate as rainy, with a dry season with an ocean economy in the ocean regions.

Growth has been led by the tourist sector, which employs about 30% of the labour force, compared to agriculture which today employs about 3% of the labour force. Despite the growth of tourism, farming and fishing continue to employ some people, as do industries that process coconuts and vanilla.\n\n{{As of|2013}}, the main export products are processed fish (60%) and non-fillet frozen fish (22%).<ref>[http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/syc/all/show/2013/ OEC \u2013 Products exported by the Seychelles (2013)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821072216/http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/tree_map/hs92/export/syc/all/show/2013/ |date=21 August 2016 }}.

The tourism sector paid better, and the plantation economy could only expand so far. The plantation sector of the economy declined in prominence, and tourism became the primary industry of Seychelles.\n\nIn recent years the government has encouraged foreign investment to upgrade hotels and other services.

Seychelles imports three times more oil than is needed for internal uses because it re-exports the surplus oil in the form of [[Bunker fuel|bunker]] for ships and aircraft calling at [[Mah\u00e9, Seychelles|Mah\u00e9]]. There are no refining capacities on the islands.

The Catholic and Anglican churches opened mission schools in 1851. The Catholic mission later operated boys' and girls' secondary schools with religious brothers and nuns from abroad even after the government became responsible for them in 1944.\n\nA teacher training college opened in 1959, when the supply of locally trained teachers began to grow, and in short time many new schools were established. Since 1981 a system of free education has been in effect, requiring attendance by all children in grades one to nine, beginning at age five. Ninety percent of all children attend nursery school at age four.\n\nThe literacy rate for school-age children rose to more than 90% by the late 1980s. Many older Seychellois had not been taught to read or write in their childhood; adult education classes helped raise adult literacy from 60% to a claimed 100% in 2014.\n\nThere are a total of 68 schools in Seychelles. The public school system consists of 23 [[Kindergarten|cr\u00e8ches]], 25 primary schools and 13 secondary schools. They are located on [[Mah\u00e9, Seychelles|Mah\u00e9]], [[Praslin]], [[La Digue]] and [[Silhouette Island|Silhouette]]. Additionally, there are three private schools: \u00c9cole Fran\u00e7aise, International School and the independent school. All the private schools are on Mah\u00e9, and the International School has a branch on [[Praslin]]. There are seven post-secondary (non-tertiary) schools: the Seychelles Polytechnic, School of Advanced Level Studies, Seychelles Tourism Academy, University of Seychelles Education, Seychelles [[Institute of Technology]], Maritime Training Center, Seychelles Agricultural and Horticultural Training Center and the National Institute for Health and Social Studies.\n\nThe administration launched plans to open a university in an attempt to slow down the [[brain drain]] that has occurred. [[University of Seychelles]], initiated in conjunction with the [[University of London]], opened on 17 September 2009 in three locations, and offers qualifications from the University of London.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{main|Cuisine of Seychelles}}\n[[File:Cutting coconuts Seychelles.jpg|thumb|Cutting open young coconuts for drinking, Seychelles]]\nStaple foods include fish, seafood and [[shellfish]] dishes, often accompanied with rice.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\">{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Mauritius, Reunion & Seychelles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bKAH9zxBiA8C&pg=PA273|year=2010|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74179-167-9|pages=273\u2013274}}</ref><ref name=\"Evans\"/> Fish dishes are cooked in several ways, such as steamed, [[Grilling|grilled]], wrapped in [[banana leaves]], baked, salted and [[Smoking (cooking)|smoked]].<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/> Curry dishes with rice are also a significant aspect of the country's cuisine.<ref name=\"Evans\"/><ref name=\"PT\">{{cite book|title=Practice Tests for IGCSE English as a Second Language Reading and Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NVT26ZRnGFQC&pg=PA50|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-14059-1|page=50|date=4 February 2010}}</ref>\n\nAdditional food staples include coconut, [[breadfruit]], [[mango]]es and ''kordonnyen fish''.<ref name=\"Tingay\"/> Dishes are often garnished with fresh flowers.<ref name=\"Tingay\">{{cite book|author=Paul Tingay|title=Seychelles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NoUynTBELeIC&pg=PA33|year=2006|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-84537-439-6|pages=33\u201334}}</ref>\n\n* Chicken dishes, such as chicken curry and [[coconut milk]].<ref name=\"Evans\">{{cite book|author=Dyfed Lloyd Evans|title=The Recipes of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJxlWwrVcKcC&pg=PA235|publisher=Dyfed Lloyd Evans|pages=235\u2013236}}</ref>\n* Coconut curry<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n* [[Dal|Dhal]] (lentils)<ref name=\"Tingay\"/>\n* Fish curry<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n* [[Saffron rice]]<ref name=\"Tingay\"/>\n* Fresh [[tropical fruit]]s<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/><ref name=\"GOT\">{{cite book|author1=Lloyd E.

The [[folk music]] of the islands incorporates multiple influences in a syncretic fashion, including African rhythms, aesthetic and instrumentation\u2014such as the zez and the bom (known in Brazil as [[berimbau]]), European [[Contredanse (organisation)|contredanse]], [[polka]] and [[mazurka]], French folk and pop, [[sega music|sega]] from [[Mauritius]] and R\u00e9union, [[taarab]], [[soukous]] and other pan-African genres, and [[Polynesia]]n, [[Music of India|Indian]] and [[Arcadia]]n music.\n\nA form of percussion music called contombley is popular, as is [[Moutya]], a fusion of native folk rhythms with Kenyan [[benga music|benga]]. Kontredans (based on European contredanse) is popular, especially in District and School competitions during the annual Festival Kreol (International Creole Festival). Moutya playing and dancing can often be seen at beach bazaars. Their main languages are [[Seychellois Creole]] of the French language, French and English.\n\n=== Media and telecommunications ===\n{{main|Media and telecommunications in Seychelles}}\n\nThe main daily newspaper is the ''[[Seychelles Nation]]'', dedicated to local government views and current affairs and topics. Other political parties operate other papers such as ''Regar''. Foreign newspapers and magazines are readily available in most bookshops and newsagents. The papers are mostly written in [[Seychellois Creole]], French and English.\n\nThe main television and radio network is operated by the [[Seychelles Broadcasting Corporation]] which offers locally produced news and discussion programmes in the Seychellois Creole language. Broadcasts run between 3&nbsp;pm and 11:30&nbsp;pm on weekdays and longer hours during the weekends. There are also imported English and French language television programmes imported on Seychellois terrestrial television and international satellite television has grown rapidly in recent years.\n\n=== Sports ===\nThe most popular sport in Seychelles is basketball, which has particularly developed in this decade.<ref>[https://www.fiba.com/seychelles-basketball-federation-eager-to-grow-sports-popularity Seychelles Basketball Federation eager to grow sport's popularity] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807191631/https://www.fiba.com/seychelles-basketball-federation-eager-to-grow-sports-popularity |date=7 August 2016 }}, Fiba.com, 12 May 2016.

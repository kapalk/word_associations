The country includes the islands of [[Mauritius Island|Mauritius]] and [[Rodrigues]], 560 kilometres (350 mi) east of Mauritius, and the [[Outer islands of Mauritius|outer islands]] of [[Agal\u00e9ga]] and [[St. Brandon]]. The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues form part of the [[Mascarene Islands]], along with nearby [[R\u00e9union]], a French overseas department. The area of the country is 2,040 km2 (790 sq mi). The capital and largest city is [[Port Louis]]. The island is widely known as the only known home of the [[dodo]], which, along with several other avian species, was made extinct by human activities relatively shortly after the island's settlement.\n\nFormerly a Dutch colony (1638\u20131710) and a French colony (1715\u20131810), Mauritius became a British colonial possession in 1810 and remained so until 1968, the year in which it attained independence. The British [[Crown colony]] of Mauritius once included the current territories of Mauritius, Rodrigues, the outer islands of Agal\u00e9ga, St. Brandon, [[Chagos Archipelago]], and [[Seychelles]]. The Mauritian territories gradually devolved with the creation of a separate colony of Seychelles in 1903 and the excision of the Chagos Archipelago in 1965. The sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago is [[Chagos Archipelago sovereignty dispute|disputed]] between Mauritius and the United Kingdom. The UK excised the archipelago from Mauritian territory in 1965, three years prior to Mauritian independence. The UK gradually [[Depopulation of Diego Garcia|depopulated the archipelago's local population]] and leased its biggest island, [[Diego Garcia]], to the United States. Access to the Chagos Archipelago is prohibited to casual tourists, the media, and its former inhabitants. Mauritius also claims sovereignty over [[Tromelin Island]] from France.\n\nThe [[Mauritians|people of Mauritius]] are multiethnic, multi-religious, [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] and multilingual. The island's government is closely modelled on the [[Westminster parliamentary system]], and Mauritius is highly ranked for [[Democracy Index|democracy]] and for [[List of countries by economic freedom|economic]] and [[Freedom in the world|political freedom]]. The [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]] of Mauritius is the second highest in [[Africa]]. Along with the other Mascarene Islands, Mauritius is known for its [[Wildlife of Mauritius|varied flora and fauna]], with many species [[endemism|endemic]] to the island. \n\nMauritius is the only country in Africa where [[Hinduism]] is the largest religion. The administration uses English as its main language.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe first historical evidence of the existence of an island now known as Mauritius is on a map produced by the [[Italian people|Italian]] [[cartographer]] Alberto Cantino in 1502.<ref>Toorawa, S. (2007). ''The medieval Waqwaq islands and the Mascarenes''.

In 1507, Portuguese sailors visited the uninhabited island. The island appears with a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name ''Cirne'' on early Portuguese maps, probably from the name of a ship in the 1507 expedition. Another Portuguese sailor, [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Pedro Mascarenhas]], gave the name ''[[Mascarene Islands|Mascarenes]]'' to the Archipelago.\n\nIn 1598, a Dutch squadron under [[Admiral]] Wybrand van Warwyck landed at [[Grand Port]] and named the island ''Mauritius'', in honour of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice van Nassau]], [[stadholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic]]. Later the island became a French colony and was renamed [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]]. On 3 December 1810, the French surrendered the island to Great Britain during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Under British rule, the island's name reverted to ''Mauritius'' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Mauritius.ogg|m|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u026a|\u0283|\u0259|s}}. Mauritius is also commonly known as ''Maurice'' ({{IPA-fr|m\u0254\u02c8\u0281is|pron}}) and ''\u00cele Maurice'' in French, ''Moris'' ({{IPA-mfe|mo\u0281is|pron}}) in [[Mauritian Creole]].\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Mauritius}}\n\n===Early history===\nThe island of Mauritius was uninhabited before its first recorded visit during the [[Middle Ages]] by [[Arab people|Arab]] sailors, who named it Dina Arobi.\n\nIn 1507, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] sailors came to the uninhabited island and established a visiting base. [[Diogo Fernandes Pereira]], a Portuguese navigator, was the first European known to land in Mauritius. He named the island \"Ilha do Cirne\". The Portuguese did not stay long as they were not interested in these islands.<ref name=\"govt\">{{cite news |url=http://www.govmu.org/English/ExploreMauritius/Pages/History.aspx#dutch|title=History|publisher=Government Portal of Mauritius|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Dutch Mauritius (1638\u20131710)===\n{{Main|Dutch Mauritius}}\n\nIn 1598 a Dutch squadron under Admiral Wybrand van Warwyck  landed at [[Grand Port]] and named the island \"Mauritius\" after [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurice of Nassau]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Maurits van Nassau'') of the [[Dutch Republic]]. The Dutch inhabited the island in 1638, from which they exploited [[ebony]] trees and introduced [[sugar cane]], [[domestic animals]] and [[deer]]. It was from here that Dutch navigator [[Abel Tasman]] set out to discover the western part of Australia. The first Dutch settlement lasted twenty years. Several attempts were subsequently made, but the settlements never developed enough to produce dividends, causing the Dutch to abandon Mauritius in 1710.<ref name=\"govt\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://culture.govmu.org/English//DOCUMENTS/PAMPHLET%20STRIPPED.PDF|title=History of Mauritius|publisher=Ministry of Art & Culture, Government Portal of Mauritius|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===French Mauritius (1715\u20131810)===\n{{main|Isle de France (Mauritius)}}\nFrance, which already controlled neighbouring \u00cele Bourbon (now [[R\u00e9union]]), took control of Mauritius in 1715 and renamed it [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]]. In 1723, the [[Code Noir]] was established to categorise one group of human beings as \"goods\", in order for the owner of these goods to be able to obtain insurance money and compensation in case of loss of his \"goods\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/ROL/TJC_Vol1.pdf|title=USIP|publisher=}}</ref> The 1735 arrival of French governor [[Bertrand-Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais]] coincided with development of a prosperous economy based on sugar production. Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais established [[Port Louis]] as a naval base and a shipbuilding centre.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nUnder his governorship, numerous buildings were erected, a number of which are still standing. These include part of Government House, the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Mon Plaisir]], and the Line Barracks, the headquarters of the [[Mauritius Police Force|police force]]. The island was under the administration of the [[French East India Company]] which maintained its presence until 1767.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\nFrom 1767 to 1810, except for a brief period during the [[French Revolution]] when the inhabitants set up a government virtually independent of France, the island was controlled by officials appointed by the French government. [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre]] lived on the island from 1768 to 1771, then went back to France, where he wrote ''[[Paul et Virginie]]'', a love story, which made the Isle de France famous wherever the French language was spoken. Two famous French governors were the Vicomte de Souillac (who constructed the Chauss\u00e9e in Port Louis<ref name=\"Toussaint2\">Port Louis, A tropical City, Auguste Toussaint. {{ISBN|0 04 969001 9}}</ref> and encouraged farmers to settle in the district of Savanne), and [[Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux]] (who saw to it that the French in the Indian Ocean should have their headquarters in Mauritius instead of [[Pondicherry]] in India).<ref name=\"Toussaint\">''A short History of Mauritius'', P.J. Barnwell & A. Toussaint</ref>\n[[Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen]] was a successful general in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and, in some ways, a rival of [[Napol\u00e9on I]]. He ruled as [[Governor of Isle de France (Mauritius)|Governor of Isle de France]] and R\u00e9union from 1803 to 1810. British naval [[cartographer]] and explorer [[Matthew Flinders]] was arrested and detained by General Decaen on the island, in contravention of an order from Napol\u00e9on. During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Mauritius became a base from which [[French corsairs]] organised successful raids on British commercial ships. The raids continued until 1810, when a [[Royal Navy]] expedition led by [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]] [[Josias Rowley]], [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] [[aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]], was sent to capture the island. Despite winning the [[Battle of Grand Port]], the only French naval victory over the British during these wars, the [[Invasion of \u00cele de France|French could not prevent the British from landing]] at [[Cap Malheureux]] three months later. They formally surrendered the island on the fifth day of the invasion, 3 December 1810,<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> on terms allowing settlers to keep their land and property and to use the French language and law of France in criminal and civil matters. Under British rule, the island's name reverted to Mauritius.<ref name=\"govt\"/>\n\n===British Mauritius (1810\u20131968)===\n{{main|British Mauritius}}\n[[File:Combat de Grand Port mg 9425.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Grand Port]] between French and British naval forces, 1810]]\nThe British administration, which began with [[Robert Townsend Farquhar|Sir Robert Farquhar]] as [[Governor of Mauritius|Governor]], led to rapid social and economic changes. However, it was tainted by the Ratsitatane episode. Ratsitatane, nephew of King Radama of Madagascar, was brought to Mauritius as a political prisoner. He managed to escape from prison and plotted a rebellion that would free the island's slaves. He was betrayed by an associate and was caught by the British forces, summarily judged, and condemned to death. He was beheaded at Plaine Verte on 15 April 1822, and his head was displayed as a deterrent against future uprisings among the slaves.<ref name=\"Selvon\">''A New Comprehensive History of Mauritius'', Sydney Selvon, 2012. {{ISBN|978-99949-34-91-1}}</ref>\n\nIn 1832, Adrien d'\u00c9pinay launched the first Mauritian newspaper (''Le Cern\u00e9en'') which was not controlled by the government. In the same year, there was a move by the procureur-general to abolish slavery without compensation to the slave owners. This gave rise to discontent, and, to check an eventual rebellion, the government ordered all the inhabitants to surrender their arms. Furthermore, a stone fortress, Fort Adelaide, was built on a hill (now known as the Citadel hill) in the centre of Port Louis to quell any uprising.<ref name=\"Toussaint2\"/>\n\n[[Slavery]] was abolished in 1835, and the planters ultimately received two million pounds sterling in compensation for the loss of their slaves who had been imported from Africa and Madagascar during the French occupation. The [[Abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolition of slavery]] had important impacts on Mauritius's society, economy and population. The planters brought a large number of [[Indentured servant|indentured labourers]] from India to work in the sugar cane fields. Between 1834 and 1921, around half a million indentured labourers were present on the island. They worked on sugar estates, factories, in transport and on construction sites. Additionally, the British brought 8,740 [[Indian people|Indian]] soldiers to the island.<ref name=\"govt\"/> [[Aapravasi Ghat]], in the bay at [[Port Louis]] and now a [[UNESCO]] site, was the first British [[colony]] to serve as a major reception centre for [[indentured servants]].\n\nAn important figure of the 19th century was [[R\u00e9my Ollier]], a journalist of mixed origin. In 1828, the colour bar was officially abolished in Mauritius, but British governors gave little power to coloured persons, and appointed only whites as leading officials. R\u00e9my Ollier petitioned to [[Queen Victoria]] to allow coloureds in the council of government, and this became possible a few years later. He also made Port Louis become a municipality so that the citizens could administer the town through their own elected representatives. A street has been named after him in Port Louis, and his bust was erected in the Jardin de la Compagnie in 1906.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1885 [[Constitution of Mauritius (1885)|a new constitution]] was introduced to Mauritius. It created elected positions on the governing council, but the franchise was restricted mainly to the French and Creole classes.\n\n[[File:Numa Desjardins Champ de Mars Port Louis 1880.jpg|thumb|left|[[Champ de Mars Racecourse]], Port Louis, 1880]]\n\nThe labourers brought from India were not always fairly treated, and a German, Adolph von Plevitz, made himself the unofficial protector of these immigrants. He mixed with many of the labourers, and in 1871 helped them to write a petition which was sent to [[Arthur Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Baron Stanmore|Governor Gordon]]. A commission was appointed to look into the complaints made by the Indian immigrants, and in 1872 two lawyers, appointed by the British Crown, were sent from England to make an inquiry. This Royal Commission recommended several measures that would affect the lives of Indian labourers during the next fifty years.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/>\n\nIn November 1901, [[Mahatma Gandhi]] visited Mauritius, on his way from South Africa to India. He stayed on the island for two weeks, and urged the Indo-Mauritian community to take an interest in education and to play a more active role in politics. Back in India, he sent over a young lawyer, [[Manilal Doctor]], to improve the plight of the Indo-Mauritians. During the same year, faster links were established with the island of Rodrigues thanks to the wireless.<ref name=\"Dinan\">''Mauritius in the making across the censuses 1846\u20132000'', Monique Dinan. {{ISBN|99903-904-6-0}}</ref>\n\nIn 1903, motorcars were introduced in Mauritius, and in 1910 the first taxis, operated by Joseph Merven, came into service. The electrification of Port Louis took place in 1909, and in the same decade the Mauritius Hydro Electric Company (managed by the Atchia Brothers) was authorised to provide power to the towns of upper Plaines Wilhems.\n\nThe 1910s were a period of political agitation. The rising middle class (made up of doctors, lawyers, and teachers) began to challenge the political power of the sugar cane landowners. Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent, mayor of Port Louis, was the leader of this new group; his party, Action Lib\u00e9rale, demanded that more people should be allowed to vote in the elections. Action Lib\u00e9rale was opposed by the Parti de l'Ordre, led by Henri Lecl\u00e9zio, the most influential of the sugar magnates.<ref name=\"Toussaint\"/> In 1911 there were riots in Port Louis due to a false rumour that Dr. Eug\u00e8ne Laurent had been murdered by the oligarchs in Curepipe. Shops and offices were damaged in the capital, and one person was killed. In the same year, 1911, the first public cinema shows took place in Curepipe, and, in the same town, a stone building was erected to house the Royal College.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/> In 1912, a wider telephone network came into service, and it was used by the government, business firms, and a few private households.\n\n[[World War I]] broke out in August 1914. Many Mauritians volunteered to fight in Europe against the Germans and in [[Mesopotamia]] against the Turks. But the war affected Mauritius much less than the wars of the eighteenth century. On the contrary, the 1914\u20131918 war was a period of great prosperity because of a boom in sugar prices. In 1919 the Mauritius Sugar Syndicate came into being, and it included 70% of all sugar producers.\n\nThe 1920s saw the rise of a \"retrocessionism\" movement which favoured the retrocession of Mauritius to France. The movement rapidly collapsed because none of the candidates who wanted Mauritius to be given back to France was elected in the 1921 elections. Due to the post-war recession, there was a sharp drop in sugar prices. Many sugar estates closed down, and it marked the end of an era for the sugar magnates who had not only controlled the economy, but also the political life of the country. Raoul Rivet, the editor of ''Le Mauricien'' newspaper, campaigned for a revision of the constitution that would give the emerging middle class a greater role in the running of the country. The principles of [[Arya Samaj]] began to infiltrate the Hindu community, who clamoured for more social justice.<ref name=\"Dinan\"/>\n\nThe 1930s saw the birth of the [[Labour Party (Mauritius)|Labour Party]], launched by Dr. Maurice Cur\u00e9. [[Emmanuel Anquetil]] rallied the urban workers while Pandit Sahadeo concentrated on the rural working class. The [[Uba riots of 1937]] resulted in reforms by the local British government that improved labour conditions and led to the un-banning of labour unions.<ref name=\"js\">{{Cite journal|title=Small-Scale Sugar Cane Farmers and Biotechnology in Mauritius: The \"Uba\" Riots of 1937 |journal = Agricultural History|volume = 69|issue = 2|last=Storey |first=William Kelleher |date=1995 |pages=163\u2013176 |jstor = 3744263}}</ref><ref name=\"rg\">{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258935447 |title=Mauritius 1937: The Origins of a Milestone in Colonial Trade Union Legislation |journal=Labor History |volume=54 |issue=3 |last=Croucher |first=Richard |last2=Mcilroy |first2=John |date=2013-07-01  |pages=223\u2013239 |doi=10.1080/0023656X.2013.804268 |access-date=2018-08-18}}</ref>  Labour Day was celebrated for the first time in 1938. More than 30,000 workers sacrificed a day's wage and came from all over the island to attend a giant meeting at the Champ de Mars.<ref>''L'ile Maurice: Vingt-Cinq le\u00e7ons d'Histoire (1598\u20131998)'', Benjamin Moutou. {{ISBN|99903-929-1-9}}</ref>\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, many Mauritians volunteered to serve under the British flag in Africa and the Near East, fighting against the German and Italian armies. Some went to England to become pilots and ground staff in the [[Royal Air Force]]. Mauritius was never really threatened, but several British ships were sunk outside Port Louis by German submarines in 1943.\n\nDuring World War II, conditions were hard in the country; the prices of commodities doubled, but the salaries of workers increased only by 10 to 20 percent. There was civil unrest, and the colonial government crushed all trade union activities. However, the labourers of Belle Vue Harel Sugar Estate went on strike on 27 September 1943. Police officers eventually fired on the crowd, and killed three labourers including a boy of ten and a pregnant woman, Anjaly Coopen.<ref>''Our Struggle, 20th Century Mauritius'', Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, Anand Mulloo</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.mu/node/203804/| title=The historical significance of Anjalay Coopen|website=[[L'Express (Mauritius)|L'Express]]|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe first general elections were held on 9 August 1948 and were won by the Labour Party. This party, led by Guy Rozemont, bettered its position in 1953, and, on the strength of the election results, demanded [[universal suffrage]]. Constitutional conferences were held in London in 1955 and 1957, and the ministerial system was introduced. Voting took place for the first time on the basis of universal adult suffrage on 9 March 1959. The general election was again won by the Labour Party, led this time by [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]].<ref name=ram>{{cite news|title=Histoire: Mauritius Independence 1961\u20131968|url=http://www.lemauricien.com/article/histoire-mauritius-independence-1961-1968|accessdate=9 September 2014|newspaper=Le Mauricien=9 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nA Constitutional Review Conference was held in London in 1961, and a programme of further constitutional advance was established. The 1963 election was won by the Labour Party and its allies. The [[Colonial Office]] noted that politics of a communal nature was gaining ground in Mauritius and that the choice of candidates (by parties) and the voting behaviour (of electors) were governed by ethnic and caste considerations.<ref name=ram/> Around that time, two eminent British academics, [[Richard Titmuss]] and [[James Meade]], published a report of the island's social problems caused by overpopulation and the monoculture of sugar cane.

As early as 1984, there was discontent. Through the Newspapers and Periodicals Amendment Act, the government tried to make every newspaper provide a bank guarantee of half a million rupees. Forty-three journalists protested by participating in a public demonstration in Port Louis, in front of Parliament. They were arrested and freed on bail.

It ruled that UK breached its obligations under Articles 2(3), 56(2), and 194(4) of UNCLOS. In reaching these conclusions, the Tribunal made several findings. It considered the undertakings given by UK to the Mauritian Ministers at the Lancaster House talks in September 1965. UK argued that those undertakings were not binding and had no status in international law. The Tribunal rejected that argument, holding that those undertakings became a binding international agreement upon the independence of Mauritius, and have bound UK since then. It found that UK's commitments to Mauritius in relation to fishing rights and oil and mineral rights in the Chagos Archipelago are legally binding. The Tribunal also found that UK's undertaking to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius when no longer needed for defence purposes is legally binding.<ref name=\"cha\"/>\nThe Tribunal held that UK had not respected Mauritius's legal rights over the Chagos Archipelago. It considered the events from February 2009 to April 2010, during which time the \u2018MPA' proposal came into being and was then imposed on Mauritius.<ref name=\"cha\"/>\n\nThe Tribunal observed that UK's failure to balance its rights and interests with those of Mauritius is to be contrasted with the approach adopted by UK with respect to the United States. It noted that the record demonstrates a conscious balancing of rights and interests, suggestions of compromise and willingness to offer assurances by UK, and an understanding of the United States' concerns in connection with the proposed \u2018MPA'. Those elements were noticeably absent in UK's approach to Mauritius. Accordingly, the Tribunal found that, in declaring the \u2018MPA', UK had acted unlawfully and in disregard of Mauritius's rights.<ref name=\"cha\"/>\n\nThe parties differ on the characterization of the dispute. Mauritius states that its case is that the MPA is unlawful under the Convention. UK argued that the dispute concerns sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. Mauritius requested the Tribunal to adjudge and declare that UK is not entitled to declare an \"MPA\" or other maritime zones because it is not the \"coastal State within the meaning of inter alia Articles 2, 55, 56 and 76 of the Convention.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pca-cpa.org/en/cases/11/|title=Characterization of the Dispute|publisher=[[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]|accessdate=21 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe sovereignty of Mauritius was explicitly recognised by two of the arbitrators and denied by none of the other three. Three members of the Tribunal found that they did not have jurisdiction to rule on that question; they expressed no view as to which of the two States has sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. Tribunal Judges [[R\u00fcdiger Wolfrum]] and James Kateka held that the Tribunal did have jurisdiction to decide this question, and concluded that UK does not have sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. \nThey found that:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lexpress.mu/sites/lexpress/files/attachments/article/2015/2015-03/2015-03-20/mu-uk_20150318_award.pdf|title=In the Matter of the Chagos }}</ref>\n\n* Internal United Kingdom documents suggested there was an ulterior motive behind the \u2018MPA' and noted the disturbing similarities and common pattern between the establishment of the so-called \"BIOT\" in 1965 and the proclamation of the \u2018MPA' in 2010;\n* the excision of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius in 1965 shows a complete disregard for the territorial integrity of Mauritius by UK;\n* UK Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]]'s threat to Premier [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam]] in 1965 that he could return home without independence if he did not consent to the excision of the Chagos Archipelago amounted to duress; Mauritian Ministers were coerced into agreeing to the detachment of the Chagos Archipelago, and that this detachment violated the international law of self-determination;\n* the \u2018MPA' is legally invalid.\n\nThe Tribunal's decision determined that UK's undertaking to return the Chagos Archipelago to Mauritius gives Mauritius an interest in significant decisions that bear upon possible future uses of the Archipelago. The result of the Tribunal's decision is that, it is now open to the Parties to enter into the negotiations that the Tribunal would have expected prior to the proclamation of the MPA, with a view to achieving a mutually satisfactory arrangement for protecting the marine environment, to the extent necessary under a \"sovereignty umbrella\".<ref name=\"cha\"/>\n\n==== International Court of Justice ====\n\n=====Amendment of exclusion clause by UK=====\n\nIn 2004, following the decision of the British government to promulgate the British Indian Ocean Territory Order (BIOT Order), which prohibited the [[Chagossians]] from remaining on the islands without express authorisation, Mauritius contemplated having recourse to the [[International Court of Justice]] to finally and conclusively settle the dispute. However, article 36 of the International Court of Justice Statute provides that it is the option of the State whether it wishes to subject itself to the ICJ\u2019s jurisdiction. Where the State chooses to be so bound, it may also restrict or limit the jurisdiction of the Court in a number of ways. The UK\u2019s clause deposited at the ICJ excluded, amongst other things, the jurisdiction of the ICJ with regard \u201cto any disputes with the government of any country which is a member of the Commonwealth with regard to situations or facts existing before 1 January 1969\u201d. The temporal limitation of 1 January 1969 was inserted to exclude all disputes arising during decolonisation. The effect of the British exclusionary clause would thus have prevented Mauritius from resorting to the ICJ on the Chagos dispute, because it is a member of the [[Commonwealth]]. Before Mauritius even left the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom quickly amended its exclusion clause to the ICJ\u2019s jurisdiction, to exclude any disputes between itself, Commonwealth States and ''former Commonwealth States'', therefore quashing any Mauritian hopes to ever have recourse to the contentious jurisdiction of the ICJ, even if it left the Commonwealth.<ref name=\"commonwealth\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.mauritiustimes.com/mt/vimalen-reddi/ |title=The Chagos Dispute: Also Giving Law A Chance |last=Reddi |first=Vimalen |access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref>\n\n=====Advisory opinion=====\n\nOn 22 June 2017, by a margin of 94 to 15 countries, the [[UN General Assembly]] asked the [[International Court of Justice]] to give an advisory opinion on the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius before the country's independence in the 1960s.

Before the Portuguese arrival in 1507, there were no terrestrial mammals on the island. This allowed the evolution of a number of flightless birds and large reptile species. The arrival of man saw the introduction of invasive alien species and the rapid destruction of habitat and the loss of much of the endemic flora and fauna. Less than 2% of the [[Forest|native forest]] now remains, concentrated in the [[Black River Gorges National Park]] in the southwest, the Bambous Mountain Range in the southeast, and the Moka-Port Louis Ranges in the northwest. There are some isolated mountains, [[Corps de Garde]], [[Le Morne Brabant]], and several [[Islets of Mauritius|offshore islands]] with remnants of coastal and mainland diversity. Over 100 species of plants and animals have become extinct and many more are threatened. Conservation activities began in the 1980s with the implementation of programmes for the reproduction of threatened bird and plant species as well as habitat restoration in the national parks and nature reserves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://npcs.govmu.org/English//DOCUMENTS/CHAP1.PDF|title=Chapter 1.

Mauritius has a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the Government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the Government and the [[National Assembly of Mauritius|National Assembly]].\n\nThe National Assembly is Mauritius's [[unicameral]] legislature, which was called the Legislative Assembly until 1992, when the country became a republic. It consists of 70 members, 62 elected for four-year terms in multi-member [[constituency|constituencies]] and eight additional members, known as \"best losers\", appointed by the Electoral Service Commission to ensure that ethnic and religious minorities are equitably represented. The UN Human Rights Committee (UNHRC), which monitors member states' compliance with the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights (ICPCR), has criticised the country's Best Loser System following a complaint by a local youth and trade union movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://country.eiu.com/article.aspx?articleid=59556590&Country=Mauritius&topic=Politics&subtopic=Forecast&subsubtopic=Election+watch&u=1&pid=1764509560&oid=1764509560&uid=1|title=UN Human Rights Committee criticises Best Loser System|publisher=Country.eiu.com|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref> The president is elected for a five-year term by the Parliament.\n\nThe island of Mauritius is divided into [[Constituencies of Mauritius|20 constituencies]] that return three members each, while Rodrigues is a single constituency that returns two members. After a general election, the Electoral Supervisory Commission may nominate up to eight additional members with a view to correct any imbalance in the representation of ethnic minorities in Parliament. This system of nominating members is commonly called the best loser system.\n\nThe political party or party alliance that wins the majority of seats in Parliament forms the government. Its leader becomes the Prime Minister, who selects the Cabinet from elected members of the Assembly, except for the Attorney General, who may not be an elected member of the Assembly. The political party or alliance which has the second largest majority forms the Official Opposition and its leader is normally nominated by the President of the Republic as the Leader of the Opposition. The Assembly elects a Speaker, a Deputy Speaker and a Deputy Chairman of Committees as some of its first tasks.\n\nMauritius is a democracy with a government elected every five years. The most recent National Assembly Election was held on 10 December 2014 in all the 20 mainland constituencies, and in the constituency covering the island of Rodrigues.

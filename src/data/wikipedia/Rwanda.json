Located a few degrees south of the [[Equator]], Rwanda is bordered by [[Uganda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Rwanda is in the [[African Great Lakes]] region and is highly elevated; its geography is dominated by mountains in the west and [[savanna]] to the east, with numerous lakes throughout the country. The climate is temperate to subtropical, with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year.\n\nThe population is [[Youth in Rwanda|young]] and predominantly rural, with a density among the highest in Africa. Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group, the [[Banyarwanda]], although within this group there are three subgroups: the [[Hutu]], [[Tutsi]] and [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]]. The Twa are a forest-dwelling [[pygmy people]] descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants. Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi; some believe differences are derived from former social [[caste]]s within a single people, while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately, and from different locations. Christianity is the largest religion in the country; the principal language is [[Kinyarwanda]], spoken by most Rwandans, with English and French serving as additional official languages.  The  [[sovereign state]] of Rwanda has a [[presidential system]] of government. The president is [[Paul Kagame]] of the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), who took office in 2000. Rwanda today has low corruption compared with neighbouring countries, although human rights organisations report suppression of opposition groups, intimidation and restrictions on freedom of speech. The country has been governed by a strict administrative hierarchy since precolonial times; there are five [[Provinces of Rwanda|provinces]] delineated by borders drawn in 2006. Rwanda is one of only two countries with a female majority in the national parliament.\n\n[[Hunter gatherer]]s settled the territory in the [[stone age|stone]] and [[iron age]]s, followed later by [[Bantu peoples]]. The population coalesced first into [[Clans of Rwanda|clans]] and then into kingdoms. The [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] dominated from the mid-eighteenth century, with the Tutsi kings conquering others militarily, centralising power and later enacting anti-Hutu policies. [[German colonial empire|Germany]] colonised Rwanda in 1884 as part of [[German East Africa]], followed by [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], which invaded in 1916 during [[World War I]]. Both European nations ruled through the kings and perpetuated a pro-Tutsi policy. The Hutu population [[Rwandan Revolution|revolted]] in 1959. They massacred numerous Tutsi and ultimately established an independent, Hutu-dominated state in 1962. A [[1973 Rwandan coup d'\u00e9tat|1973 military coup]] saw a change of leadership, but pro-Hutu policy remained. The Tutsi-led [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] launched a [[Rwandan Civil War|civil war]] in 1990. The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, died together when their aeroplane was shot down in April 1994. Social tensions erupted in the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide]], in which Hutu extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1 million Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The RPF ended the genocide with a military victory.\n\n[[Economy of Rwanda|Rwanda's economy]] suffered heavily in wake of the 1994 genocide, but has since strengthened. The economy is based mostly on [[subsistence agriculture]]. Coffee and tea are the major [[cash crops]] for export. [[Tourism in Rwanda|Tourism]] is a fast-growing sector and is now the country's leading foreign exchange earner. Rwanda is one of only two countries in which [[mountain gorilla]]s can be visited safely, and visitors pay high prices for gorilla tracking permits. Music and dance are an integral part of Rwandan culture, particularly drums and the highly choreographed ''intore'' dance. Traditional arts and crafts are produced throughout the country, including ''[[imigongo]]'', a unique cow dung art.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name \"Rwanda\" is derived from the [[Rwanda-Rundi]] word ''rwanda'' meaning \"domain\" or literally an \"area occupied by a swarm\". The official name of the country was \"Rwandese Republic\" until May 2003, when the adoption of a new national constitution changed it to its current name of \"Republic of Rwanda\".\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Rwanda|German East Africa|Ruanda-Urundi}}\nModern human settlement of what is now Rwanda dates from, at the latest, the [[last glacial period]], either in the [[Neolithic]] period around 8000 BC, or in the [[Neolithic Subpluvial|long humid period]] which followed, up to around 3000 BC.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=44}} Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of sparse settlement by [[hunter gatherer]]s in the late [[stone age]], followed by a larger population of early [[Iron Age]] settlers, who produced dimpled [[pottery]] and iron tools.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=36}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=45}} These early inhabitants were the ancestors of the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], aboriginal [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who remain in Rwanda today.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, a number of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups migrated into Rwanda, clearing forest land for agriculture.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=58}} The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their habitat and moved to the mountain slopes.{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} Historians have several theories regarding the nature of the Bantu migrations; one theory is that the first settlers were [[Hutu]], while the [[Tutsi]] migrated later to form a distinct racial group, possibly of Nilo-hamitic origin.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=16}} An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=58}} Under this theory, the Hutu and Tutsi distinction arose later and was a class distinction rather than a racial one.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=69}}{{sfn|Shyaka|pp=10\u201311}}\n\n[[File:Rwanda Nyanza Mwami Palace.jpg|thumb|left|A reconstruction of the [[King of Rwanda]]'s palace at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]]|alt=Photograph of King's palace in Nyanza, Rwanda depicting main entrance, front and conical roof]]\n\nThe earliest form of social organisation in the area was the [[Clans of Rwanda|clan]] (''ubwoko'').{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=88}} The clans were not limited to genealogical lineages or geographical area, and most included Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=88\u201389}} From the 15th century, the clans began to coalesce into kingdoms;{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=141}} by 1700 around eight kingdoms existed in present-day Rwanda.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=482}} One of these, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]], ruled by the Tutsi [[Nyiginya]] clan, became increasingly dominant from the mid-eighteenth century.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}} The kingdom reached its greatest extent during the nineteenth century under the reign of King [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli Rwabugiri]]. Rwabugiri conquered several smaller states, expanded the kingdom west and north,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=160}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} and initiated administrative reforms; these included ''[[ubuhake]]'', in which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle, and therefore privileged status, to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=13\u201314}} and ''uburetwa'', a [[corv\u00e9e]] system in which Hutu were forced to work for Tutsi chiefs.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} Rwabugiri's changes caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=69}} The Twa were better off than in pre-Kingdom days, with some becoming dancers in the royal court,{{sfn|King|2007|p=75}} but their numbers continued to decline.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=6}}\n\nThe [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Berlin Conference of 1884]] assigned the territory to [[German Empire|Germany]] as part of [[German East Africa]], marking the beginning of the colonial era. The explorer [[Gustav Adolf von G\u00f6tzen]] was the first European to significantly explore the country in 1894; he crossed from the south-east to Lake Kivu and met the king.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=217}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=9}} The Germans did not significantly alter the social structure of the country, but exerted influence by supporting the king and the existing hierarchy and delegating power to local chiefs.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=25}} <ref>See also Helmut Strizek, \"Geschenkte Kolonien: Ruanda und Burundi unter deutscher Herrschaft\", Berlin: Ch. Links Verlag, 2006</ref> [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian]] forces took control of Rwanda and [[Burundi]] in 1916, during [[World War I]], beginning a period of more direct colonial rule.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=260}} Belgium ruled both Rwanda and Burundi as a [[League of Nations mandate]] called [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. The Belgians also simplified and centralised the power structure,{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|p=270}} and introduced large-scale projects in education, health, public works, and agricultural supervision, including new crops and improved agricultural techniques to try to reduce the incidence of famine.{{sfn|Chr\u00e9tien|2003|pp=276\u2013277}} Both the Germans and the Belgians promoted Tutsi supremacy, considering the Hutu and Tutsi different [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]].{{sfn|Appiah|Gates|2010|p=450}} In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards labelling each individual as either Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. While it had previously been possible for particularly wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, the identity cards prevented any further movement between the classes.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n[[File:Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana (1980).jpg|thumb|upright=0.55|right|[[Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana]], president from 1973 to 1994|alt=Photograph of President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana arriving with entourage at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, USA on 25 September 1980.]]\n[[Belgium]] continued to rule [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (of which Rwanda formed the northern part) as a [[United Nations Trust Territories|UN Trust Territory]] after the [[Second World War]], with a mandate to oversee eventual [[Decolonisation of Africa|independence]].{{sfn|United Nations (II)}}{{sfn|United Nations (III)}} Tensions escalated between the Tutsi, who favoured early independence, and the Hutu emancipation movement, culminating in the 1959 [[Rwandan Revolution]]: Hutu activists began killing Tutsi and destroying their houses,{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=267}} forcing more than 100,000 people to seek refuge in neighbouring countries.{{sfn|Gourevitch|2000|pp=58\u201359}}{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=51}} In 1961, the suddenly pro-Hutu Belgians held a [[Rwandan monarchy referendum, 1961|referendum]] in which the country voted to abolish the monarchy.

Neither side was able to gain a decisive advantage in the war,{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=135\u2013136}} but by 1992 it had weakened Habyarimana's authority; mass demonstrations forced him into a coalition with the domestic opposition and eventually to sign the 1993 [[Arusha Accords (Rwanda)|Arusha Accords]] with the RPF.{{sfn|Prunier|1995|pp=190\u2013191}} The cease-fire ended on 6 April 1994 when [[Assassination of Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|Habyarimana's plane was shot down]] near Kigali Airport, killing him.{{sfn|BBC News (III)|2010}} The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the [[Rwandan genocide]], which began within a few hours. Over the course of approximately 100 days, around 800,000{{sfn|Henley|2007}} Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks on the orders of the interim government.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=386}} Many Twa were also killed, despite not being directly targeted.{{sfn|UNPO|2008|loc=History}}\n\nThe Tutsi RPF restarted their offensive, and took control of the country methodically, gaining control of the whole country by mid-July.{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=299}} The international response to the genocide was limited, with major powers reluctant to strengthen the already overstretched [[United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda|UN peacekeeping force]].{{sfn|Dallaire|2005|p=364}} When the RPF took over, approximately two million Hutu [[Great Lakes refugee crisis|fled to neighbouring countries]], in particular [[Za\u00efre]], fearing reprisals;{{sfn|Prunier|1995|p=312}} additionally, the RPF-led army was a key belligerent in the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s.{{sfn|BBC News (V)|2010}} Within Rwanda, a period of reconciliation and justice began, with the establishment of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda]] (ICTR) and the reintroduction of ''[[Gacaca]]'', a traditional village court system.{{sfn|Bowcott|2014}} Since 2000 Rwanda's economy,{{sfn|World Bank (X)}} tourist numbers,{{sfn|World Bank (XI)}} and [[Human Development Index]] have grown rapidly;{{sfn|UNDP (I)|2010}} between 2006 and 2011 the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45%,{{sfn|National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda|2012}} while [[life expectancy]] rose from 46.6 years in 2000{{sfn|UNDP (V)|2013|p=2}} to 59.7 years in 2015.{{sfn|CIA (I)}}\n\n== Politics and government ==\n{{Main|Politics of Rwanda|Foreign relations of Rwanda|Military of Rwanda}}\n[[File:Paul Kagame 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Rwandan President [[Paul Kagame]]|alt=Photograph of Paul Kagame, taken in Busan, South Korea, in 2014]]\nThe [[President of Rwanda]] is the [[head of state]],{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 98}} and has broad powers including creating policy in conjunction with the Cabinet,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 117}} exercising the [[Prerogative of mercy (Rwanda)|prerogative of mercy]],{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 111}} commanding the [[Rwandan Defence Forces|armed forces]],{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 110}} negotiating and ratifying treaties,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 189}} signing presidential orders,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 112}} and declaring war or a state of emergency.{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 110}} The President is elected by popular vote every seven years,{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=articles 100\u2013101}} and appoints the [[Prime Minister of Rwanda|Prime Minister]] and all other members of [[Council of Ministers of Rwanda|Cabinet]].{{sfn|CJCR|2003|loc=article 116}} The incumbent President is [[Paul Kagame]], who took office upon the resignation of his predecessor, [[Pasteur Bizimungu]], in 2000.

programme.{{sfn|MINEDUC|2010|p=2}} In 2012, this started to be expanded to 12 years.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=935}} A 2015 study suggests that while enrollment rates in primary schools are \"near ubiquity\", rates of completion are low and repetition rates high.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=931}} While schooling is fee-free, there is an expectation that parents should contribute to the cost of their children's education by providing them with materials, supporting teacher development and making a contribution to school construction. According to the government, these costs should not be a basis for the exclusion of children from education, however.{{sfn|Williams|Abbott|Mupenzi|2015|p=935}} There are many private schools across the country, some church-run, which follow the same syllabus but charge fees.{{sfn|Briggs|Booth|2006|p=27}} From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; because of the country's increasing ties with the [[East African Community]] and the [[Commonwealth]], only the English syllabi are now offered.{{sfn|McGreal|2009}} The country has a number of institutions of tertiary education.

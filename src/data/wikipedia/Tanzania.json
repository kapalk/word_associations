[[Mount Kilimanjaro]], Africa's highest mountain, is in north-eastern Tanzania.\n\nThe very first humans known lived in [[Pliocene]] Tanzania 6 million years ago. The genus [[Australopithecus]] ranged all over Africa 4-2 million years ago; and the oldest remains of the [[Homo]] genus are found near [[Olduvai Gorge|Lake Olduvai]]. Following the rise of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' 1.8 million years ago, mankind spread all over the Old World, and later in the New World and Australia under the species ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. [[Homo sapiens]] also overtook Africa and absorbed the older archaic species and subspecies of humanity. One of the oldest known ethnic groups still existing, the Hadzabe, appears to have originated in Tanzania, and their oral history recalls ancestors who were tall and were the first to use fire, medicine, and lived in caves, much like [[Homo erectus]] or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' who lived in the same region before them.\n\nLater in the Stone and Bronze age, prehistoric migrations into Tanzania included [[South Cushitic languages|Southern Cushitic]] speakers who moved south from present-day [[Ethiopia]];<ref name=\"Genetics\"/> Eastern Cushitic people who moved into Tanzania from north of [[Lake Turkana]] about 2,000 and 4,000 years ago;<ref name=\"Genetics\"/> and the [[Southern Nilotic languages|Southern Nilotes]], including the [[Datooga people|Datoog]], who originated from the present-day [[South Sudan]]\u2013Ethiopia border region between 2,900 and 2,400 years ago.<ref name=\"Genetics\"/>{{rp|page 18}} These movements took place at about the same time as the settlement of the [[Bantu languages|Mashariki Bantu]] from [[West Africa]] in the [[Lake Victoria]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]] areas.

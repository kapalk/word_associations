The first written mention of Japan is in [[History of China|Chinese history]] texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from other regions, mainly [[Imperial China|China]], followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized [[History of Japan|Japan's history]].\n\nFrom the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'' who ruled in the name of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]. Japan entered into a long [[Sakoku|period of isolation]] in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet [[Bakumatsu|pressured Japan]] to open to the West. After nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection, the Imperial Court [[Meiji oligarchy|regained]] its political power in 1868 through the help of several clans from [[Ch\u014dsh\u016b Domain|Ch\u014dsh\u016b]] and [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]]&nbsp;\u2013 and the [[Empire of Japan]] was established. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and [[World War I]] allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing [[Japanese militarism|militarism]]. The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of 1937 expanded into part of [[World War II]] in 1941, which came to an [[End of World War II in Asia|end in 1945]] following the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]]. Since adopting its revised [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] on May 3, 1947, during the [[Occupation of Japan|occupation]] led by [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]], the [[sovereign state]] of Japan has maintained a [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[constitutional monarchy]] with an [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] and an elected legislature called the [[National Diet]].\n\nJapan is a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations#ASEAN Plus Three and Six|ASEAN Plus mechanism]], [[United Nations|UN]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], the [[Group of Seven|G7]], the [[Group of Eight|G8]], and the [[G20]], and is considered a [[great power]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/01/04/the-seven-great-powers/|title=The Seven Great Powers|publisher=American-Interest|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Balance of Power\">{{cite book|author1=T.

At the end of the seventh century, a delegation from Japan requested that ''Nihon'' be used as the name of their country. This name may have its origin in a letter sent in 607 and recorded in the [[Book of Sui|official history]] of the [[Sui dynasty]]. [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]], the Regent of Japan, sent a mission to China with a letter in which he called himself {{Nihongo|\"the Emperor of the Land where the Sun rises\"|\u65e5\u51fa\u8655\u5929\u5b50}}. The message said: \"Here, I, the emperor of the country where the sun rises, send a letter to the emperor of the country where the sun sets. How are you[?]\".\n\n[[File:King of Na gold seal faces.jpg|thumb|The \"[[King of Na gold seal]]\", said to have been granted to [[Nakoku|Na]] king of [[Wa (Japan)]] by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]] in 57 CE. The seal reads \"{{Nihongo2|\u6f22\u59d4\u5974\u570b\u738b}}\".

The term {{Nihongo|''Wa''|\u548c}} is a homophone of ''Wo'' {{Nihongo2|\u502d}} (pronounced \"Wa\" by the Japanese), which has been used by the Chinese as a designation for the Japanese as early as the third century [[Three Kingdoms]] period.

It has traditionally been typified by wooden structures, elevated slightly off the ground, with tiled or thatched roofs. Sliding doors (''[[fusuma]]'') were used in place of walls, allowing the internal configuration of a space to be customized for different occasions. People usually sat on cushions or otherwise on the floor, traditionally; chairs and high tables were not widely used until the 20th century. Since the 19th century, however, Japan has incorporated much of Western, [[modern architecture|modern]], and [[post-modern architecture]] into construction and design, and is today a leader in cutting-edge architectural design and technology.\n\nThe introduction of [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]] during the sixth century was a catalyst for large-scale [[Buddhist temples in Japan|temple]] building using complicated techniques in wood. Influence from the Chinese [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] dynasties led to the foundation of the first permanent capital in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]. Its checkerboard street layout used the Chinese capital of [[Chang'an]] as a template for its design. A gradual increase in the size of buildings led to standard units of measurement as well as refinements in layout and garden design. The introduction of the [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] emphasised simplicity and modest design as a counterpoint to the excesses of the aristocracy.\n\nDuring the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868 the history of Japanese architecture was radically changed by two important events. The first was the [[Shinbutsu bunri|Kami and Buddhas Separation Act]] of 1868, which formally separated Buddhism from [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]] from [[Shinto shrine]]s, breaking an association between the two which had lasted well over a thousand years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=Jacqueline|title=Review of ''Of Heretics and Martyrs in Meiji Japan: Muslim and Its Persecution'' by James Edward Ketelaar|journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies|volume=53|issue=2|pages=582\u2013598|date=December 1993|url=http://www.thezensite.com/ZenBookReviews/Of-Heretics_and_Martyrs.html#note1|accessdate=June 13, 2011|doi=10.2307/2719461|jstor=2719461}}</ref>\n\nSecond, it was then that Japan underwent a period of intense [[Westernization]] in order to compete with other developed countries. Initially architects and styles from abroad were imported to Japan but gradually the country taught its own architects and began to express its own style. Architects returning from study with western architects introduced the [[International style (architecture)|International Style]] of modernism into Japan. However, it was not until after the Second World War that Japanese architects made an impression on the international scene, firstly with the work of architects like [[Kenz\u014d Tange]] and then with theoretical movements like [[Metabolist Movement|Metabolism]].\n\n===Art===\n{{Main|Japanese art}}\n{{Further|Japanese garden|Japanese aesthetics}}\n{{multiple image\n| total_width     = 320\n| caption1 = 19th-century [[ukiyo-e]] [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock print]]'' [[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]''\n| caption2 = [[Ritsurin Garden]], one of the most famous strolling gardens in Japan\n| direction = horizontal\n| image1    = The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg\n| image2    = 150504_Ritsurin_Park_Takamatsu_Kagawa_pref_Japan01s3.jpg\n}}\nThe [[Ise Grand Shrine|Shrines of Ise]] have been celebrated as the prototype of Japanese architecture.<ref>{{cite book |title=Ise: Prototype of Japanese Architecture |author1=Tange, Kenzo |author2=Kawazoe, Noboru |year=1965 |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press}}</ref> Largely of wood, [[Minka|traditional housing]] and many [[Japanese Buddhist architecture|temple buildings]] see the use of [[tatami]] mats and [[Sh\u014dji|sliding doors]] that break down the distinction between rooms and indoor and outdoor space.<ref>{{cite book |title=What is Japanese Architecture?: A Survey of Traditional Japanese Architecture with a List of Sites and a Map |author1=Kazuo, Nishi |author2=Kazuo, Hozumi |year=1995 |publisher=Kodansha |isbn=978-4-7700-1992-9|url={{Google books|oZl_yEJGtUYC|page=|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}} }}</ref> [[Japanese sculpture]], largely of wood, and [[Japanese painting]] are among the oldest of the Japanese arts, with early figurative paintings dating back to at least 300 BC.

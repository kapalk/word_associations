However, universal citizenship for all permanent residents was not adopted. Instead, citizenship was granted to persons who had been citizens of Latvia at the day of loss of independence at 1940 as well as their descendants. As a consequence, the majority of ethnic non-Latvians did not receive Latvian citizenship since neither they nor their parents had ever been citizens of Latvia, becoming [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens]] or citizens of other former Soviet republics. By 2011, more than half of non-citizens had taken naturalisation exams and received Latvian citizenship.

In formal divisions, Riga region, which includes the capital and parts of other regions that have a strong relationship with the capital, is also often included in regional divisions; e.g., there are five [[planning regions of Latvia]] ({{lang-lv|pl\u0101no\u0161anas re\u0123ioni}}), which were created in 2009 to promote balanced development of all regions. Under this division Riga region includes large parts of what traditionally is considered Vidzeme, Courland, and Zemgale. [[Statistical regions of Latvia]], established in accordance with the EU [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics]], duplicate this division, but divides Riga region into two parts with the capital alone being a separate region.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\nThe largest city in Latvia is Riga, the second largest city is Daugavpils and the third largest city is Liepaja.\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Latvia|Parliament of Latvia|Government of Latvia}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; float:left; margin-right:9px; margin-left:2px;\"\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Flickr - Saeima - 10.Saeimas deput\u0101ts Raimonds V\u0113jonis.jpg|125px]]\n| style=\"text-align:left;\"| [[File:Karins, Krisjanis-9702.jpg|125px]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Raimonds V\u0113jonis]]<br /><small>[[President of Latvia|President]]</small>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|[[Arturs Kri\u0161j\u0101nis Kari\u0146\u0161]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of Latvia|Prime Minister]]</small>\n|}\n\nThe 100-seat [[unicameralism|unicameral]] Latvian parliament, the ''[[Saeima]]'', is [[General election|elected]] by direct popular vote every four years.

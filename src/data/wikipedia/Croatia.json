It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].\n\nInhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]], the [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into two duchies by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]].\n\nFollowing the Axis [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, most of the Croatian territory was incorporated into the [[Independent State of Croatia|Nazi-backed client-state]] which led to the development of a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] and the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]] which after the war become a founding member and a federal constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.\n\nThe  [[sovereign state]] of Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]] and a [[developed country]] with a [[very high standard of living]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].\n\n[[Croatia's economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]] and [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture. [[Tourism in Croatia|Tourism]] is a significant source of revenue, with Croatia ranked among the [[World Tourism rankings|top 20]] most popular tourist destinations in the world. The state controls a part of the economy, with substantial government expenditure. The European Union is Croatia's most important [[trading partner]]. Croatia provides a [[social security]], [[Healthcare in Croatia|universal health care]] system, and a tuition-free [[Education in Croatia|primary and secondary education]], while supporting [[Culture of Croatia|culture]] through numerous public institutions and corporate investments in [[Media of Croatia|media]] and [[Croatian literature|publishing]].\n\n== Etymology ==\n{{Main|Name of Croatia}}\n\n[[File:Greda i zabat s natpisom kneza Branimira 879.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Branimir Inscription]] is the oldest preserved monument containing an inscription defining a Croatian medieval ruler as a duke of Croats]]\nThe [[name of Croatia]] derives from [[Medieval Latin]] ''Cro\u0101tia''.

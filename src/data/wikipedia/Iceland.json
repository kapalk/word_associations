Iceland is [[High island|volcanically]] and [[geothermal (geology)|geologically active]]. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and [[lava field]]s, [[mountains]], and [[glacier]]s, and many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the [[Arctic Circle]]. Its high latitude and marine influence keep summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a [[tundra climate]].\n\nAccording to the ancient manuscript ''[[Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k]]'', the [[settlement of Iceland]] began in 874 AD when the [[Norway|Norwegian]] chieftain [[Ing\u00f3lfr Arnarson]] became the first permanent settler on the island.<ref name = tomasson/> In the following centuries, [[Norwegians]], and to a lesser extent other [[Scandinavia]]ns, emigrated to Iceland, bringing with them [[thrall]]s (i.e., slaves or serfs) of [[Gaels|Gaelic]] origin. The island was governed as an [[Icelandic Commonwealth|independent commonwealth]] under the [[Althing]], one of the world's oldest functioning legislative assemblies. Following a [[Age of Sturlungs|period of civil strife]], Iceland acceded to Norwegian rule in the 13th century. The establishment of the [[Kalmar Union]] in 1397 united the kingdoms of Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's integration into that union, coming under Danish rule after Sweden's secession from the union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom introduced [[Lutheranism]] forcefully in 1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence. In the wake of the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Iceland's struggle for independence took form and culminated in [[Danish\u2013Icelandic Act of Union|independence in 1918]] and the founding of a [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|republic in 1944]]. Until the 20th century, Iceland relied largely on subsistence fishing and agriculture, and was among the poorest countries in Europe. Industrialisation of the fisheries and [[Marshall Plan]] aid following [[World War II]] brought prosperity and Iceland became one of the wealthiest and most developed nations in the world. In 1994, it became a part of the [[European Economic Area]], which further diversified the economy into sectors such as finance, biotechnology, and manufacturing.\n\nIceland has a [[market economy]] with relatively low taxes, compared to other [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0,2340,en_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=OECD Tax Database |website=Oecd.org |accessdate=26 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125144548/http://www.oecd.org/document/60/0%2C2340%2Cen_2649_34533_1942460_1_1_1_1%2C00.html |archivedate=25 January 2010  }}</ref> It maintains a [[Nordic model|Nordic social welfare system]] that provides [[universal health care]] and tertiary education for its citizens.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |title=The Icelandic Welfare State and the Conditions of Children |last=\u00d3lafsson |first=Stef\u00e1n |date=12 May 2004 |website=borg.hi.is |accessdate=22 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050818131819/http://www.borg.hi.is/ChildWelfare |archivedate=18 August 2005 }}</ref> Iceland ranks high in economic, [[Democracy Index#Democracy Index by country (2017)|democratic]], social stability, and [[Human Development Index#Inequality-adjusted HDI|equality]], currently ranking first in the world by [[List of countries by wealth per adult#List of countries by median and mean wealth per adult (USD)|median wealth per adult]].

Following Naddodd, the Swede [[Gar\u00f0ar Svavarsson]] arrived, and so the island was then called Gar\u00f0arsh\u00f3lmur which means \"Gar\u00f0ar's Isle\".\n\nThen came a Viking named [[Fl\u00f3ki Vilger\u00f0arson]]; his daughter drowned en route, then his livestock starved to death. The sagas say that the rather despondent Fl\u00f3ki climbed a mountain and saw a fjord ([[Arnarfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur]]) full of icebergs, which led him to give the island its new and present name.<ref name=Evans>Evans, Andrew.

The Government of Iceland established an embassy in Copenhagen and requested that Denmark carry out on its behalf certain defence and foreign affairs matters, subject to consultation with the [[Althing]]. Danish embassies around the world displayed two coats of arms and two flags: those of the Kingdom of Denmark and those of the [[Kingdom of Iceland]]. Iceland's legal position became comparable to those of countries belonging to the Commonwealth of Nations such as Canada whose sovereign is Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nDuring World War II, Iceland joined Denmark in asserting neutrality. After the [[German occupation of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940, the Althing replaced the King with a regent and declared that the Icelandic government would take control of its own defence and foreign affairs. A month later, British armed forces [[Operation Fork|invaded and occupied the country]], violating Icelandic [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]].

Only when the party leaders are unable to reach a conclusion by themselves within a reasonable time span does the president exercise this power and appoint the cabinet personally. This has not happened since the republic was founded in 1944, but in 1942 regent [[Sveinn Bj\u00f6rnsson]], who had been installed in that position by the Althing in 1941, appointed a non-parliamentary government.

The extent of the political power possessed by the office of the president is disputed by legal scholars{{which|date=June 2016}}, in Iceland; several provisions of the constitution appear to give the president some important powers, but other provisions and traditions suggest differently.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} In 1980, Icelanders elected [[Vigd\u00eds Finnbogad\u00f3ttir]] as president, the world's first directly elected female head of state.

On 11 June 2010, the [[Same-sex marriage in Iceland|Icelandic parliament amended the marriage law]], making it gender neutral and defining marriage as between two individuals, making Iceland one of the first countries in the world to legalise [[same-sex marriage]]s.

The sagas are a significant part of the Icelandic heritage]]\nIceland's best-known classical works of literature are the [[Icelanders' sagas]], prose epics set in Iceland's age of settlement. The most famous of these include ''[[Nj\u00e1ls saga]]'', about an epic blood feud, and ''[[Gr\u00e6nlendinga saga]]'' and ''[[Saga of Erik the Red|Eir\u00edks saga]]'', describing the discovery and settlement of Greenland and Vinland (modern [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]). ''[[Egils saga]]'', ''[[Laxd\u00e6la saga]]'', ''[[Grettis saga]]'', ''[[G\u00edsla saga]]'' and ''[[Gunnlaugs saga ormstungu]]'' are also notable and popular Icelanders' sagas.\n\nA translation of the Bible was published in the 16th century. Important compositions since the 15th to the 19th century include sacred verse, most famously the [[Passion Hymns]] of [[Hallgr\u00edmur P\u00e9tursson]], and ''[[r\u00edmur]]'', rhyming epic poems. Originating in the 14th century, ''r\u00edmur'' were popular into the 19th century, when the development of new literary forms was provoked by the influential, [[Romantic nationalism|National-Romantic]] writer [[J\u00f3nas Hallgr\u00edmsson]]. In recent times, Iceland has produced many great writers, the best-known of whom is arguably [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1955 (the only Icelander to win a Nobel Prize thus far). [[Steinn Steinarr]] was an influential modernist poet during the early 20th century who remains popular.\n\nIcelanders are avid consumers of literature, with the highest number of bookstores per capita in the world. For its size, Iceland imports and translates more international literature than any other nation.<ref name = \"autogenerated60\"/> Iceland also has the highest per capita publication of books and magazines,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/3396.htm|title = Cultural Achievements|publisher = State.gov|date = 15 June 2012|accessdate = 12 October 2012}}</ref> and around 10% of the population will publish a book in their lifetimes.<ref>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 61.</ref>\n\nMost books in Iceland are sold between late September to early November.

Several other Icelandic men and women artists studied at [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]] at that time, including [[\u00c1sgr\u00edmur J\u00f3nsson]], who together with \u00de\u00f3rarinn created a distinctive portrayal of Iceland's landscape in a romantic naturalistic style. Other landscape artists quickly followed in the footsteps of \u00de\u00f3rarinn and \u00c1sgr\u00edmur. These included [[J\u00f3hannes Sveinsson Kjarval|J\u00f3hannes Kjarval]] and [[J\u00fal\u00edana Sveinsd\u00f3ttir]]. Kjarval in particular is noted for the distinct techniques in the application of paint that he developed in a concerted effort to render the characteristic [[volcanic rock]] that dominates the Icelandic environment. [[Einar H\u00e1konarson]] is an expressionistic and figurative painter who by some is considered to have brought the figure back into Icelandic painting. In the 1980s, many Icelandic artists worked with the subject of the new painting in their work.\n\nIn the recent years artistic practice has multiplied, and the Icelandic art scene has become a setting for many large scale projects and exhibitions. The artist run gallery space Kling og Bang, members of which later ran the studio complex and exhibition venue Klink og Bank, has been a significant part of the trend of self-organised spaces, exhibitions and projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://this.is/klingogbang/text.php?lang=en&|title=Kling & Bang Gallery, This.is|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> [[The Living Art Museum]], Reykjav\u00edk Municipal Art Museum, [[Reykjav\u00edk Art Museum]] and the [[National Gallery of Iceland]] are the larger, more established institutions, curating shows and festivals.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\">\nThorarinn thingvellir.jpg|''[[\u00deingvellir]]'' by [[\u00de\u00f3rarinn B. \u00deorl\u00e1ksson]]\nThorfinn Karlsefni 1918.jpg|Statue of [[Thorfinn Karlsefni]] by Icelandic sculptor [[Einar J\u00f3nsson]] in [[Philadelphia]]\nLaxness portrett einar hakonarson 1984.jpg|The writer [[Halld\u00f3r Laxness]] by [[Einar H\u00e1konarson]], 1984\nGrassodenh\u00e4user.jpg|Traditional [[Icelandic turf house]]s.

Notable Icelandic music acts include medieval music group [[Voces Thules]], alternative and indie rock acts such as [[The Sugarcubes]], [[S\u00f3ley]] and [[Of Monsters and Men]], jazz fusion band [[Mezzoforte (band)|Mezzoforte]], pop singers such as [[Hafd\u00eds Huld]], [[Emil\u00edana Torrini]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]], solo ballad singers like [[Bubbi Morthens]], and [[post-rock]] bands such as [[Amiina]] and [[Sigur R\u00f3s]]. [[Independent music]] is strong in Iceland, with bands such as [[m\u00fam]] and solo artists.\n\nTraditional Icelandic music is strongly religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, due to the scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgr\u00edmur P\u00e9tursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magn\u00fas Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by [[Pump organ|harmoniums]]. Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called r\u00edmur. R\u00edmur are epic tales, usually [[a cappella]], which can be traced back to [[skald]]ic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes.<ref>Cronshaw, Andrew. (1999) \"Iceland\". In ''World Music: The Rough Guide''. London: Rough Guides Ltd. pp.&nbsp;168\u201369.</ref> The best known r\u00edmur poet of the 19th century was [[Sigur\u00f0ur Brei\u00f0fj\u00f6r\u00f0]] (1798\u20131846).

Seafood is central to most Icelandic cooking, particularly [[cod]] and [[haddock]] but also [[salmon]], [[herring]], and [[halibut]]. It is often prepared in a wide variety of ways, either smoked, pickled, boiled, or dried. Lamb is by far the most common meat, and it tends to be either smoke-cured (known as ''[[hangikj\u00f6t]]'') or salt-preserved (''saltkj\u00f6t''). Many older dishes make use of every part of the sheep, such as ''[[sl\u00e1tur]]'', which consists of [[offal]] (internal organs and entrails) minced together with blood and served in sheep stomach.

Its potency<!-- in combination with the fact that it had a white scull on the black label, as a warning, according to the wp article, but that needs sources --> has earned it the nickname ''svarti dau\u00f0i'' (\"Black Death\").

For both the European and the world championship, Iceland is to date the smallest nation in terms of population to qualify.\n\nIceland is also the smallest country to ever qualify for [[Eurobasket]]. They did it in both 2015 and 2017. Although Iceland has had great success qualifying for [[Eurobasket]], they have not managed to win a single game in the European Basketball final stages.\n\nIceland has excellent conditions for [[skiing]], [[fishing]], [[snowboarding]], [[ice climbing]] and [[rock climbing]], although [[mountain climbing]] and [[hiking]] are preferred by the general public. Iceland is also a world-class destination for alpine ski touring and [[Telemark skiing]], with the Troll Peninsula in Northern Iceland being the main centre of activity. Although the country's environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there are nevertheless lots of golf courses throughout the island, and Iceland has a greater percentage of the population playing golf than Scotland with over 17,000 registered golfers out of a population of approximately 300,000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Tee Off In The Midnight Sun of Reykjavik|url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/sport/other-sport/golf/tee-midnight-sun-reykjavik-4449000|accessdate=4 May 2016|date=25 June 2013}}</ref> Iceland hosts an annual international golf tournament known as the Arctic Open played through the night during the summer solstice at [[Akureyri Golf Club]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Daley|first1=Paul|title=Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective, Volume 4|date=2008|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781589806160|page=92}}</ref><ref name = w111>[[#Wilcox|Wilcox and Latif]], p. 111</ref> Iceland has also won the second most [[World's Strongest Man]] competitions of any country with nine titles, including four by both [[Magn\u00fas Ver Magn\u00fasson]] and [[J\u00f3n P\u00e1ll Sigmarsson]] and most recently [[Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson]] in 2018.\n\nIceland is also one of the leading countries in [[ocean rowing]], Icelandic rower [[Fiann Paul]] became the fastest and the most record-breaking ocean rower.

Sa'id built impressive palaces and gardens in Zanzibar. Rivalry between his two sons was resolved, with the help of forceful British diplomacy, when one of them, [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid]], succeeded to Zanzibar and to the many regions claimed by the family on the Swahili Coast.

Political reforms were eventually introduced. Historically, voters had been chosen from among tribal leaders, intellectuals, and businessmen. In 1997 Sultan Qaboos decreed that women could vote for, and stand for election to, the Majlis al-Shura, the [[Consultative Assembly of Oman]]. Two women were duly elected to the body.\n\nIn 2002, voting rights were extended to all citizens over the age of 21, and the first elections to the Consultative Assembly under the new rules were held in 2003. In 2004, the Sultan appointed Oman's first female minister with portfolio, [[Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel|Sheikha Aisha bint Khalfan bin Jameel al-Sayabiyah]]. She was appointed to the post of National Authority for Industrial Craftsmanship, an office that attempts to preserve and promote Oman's traditional crafts and stimulate industry.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2818553.stm \"Oman appoints first female minister\"].

Although they did not call for the ousting of the regime, demonstrators demanded political reforms, improved living conditions, and the creation of more jobs. They were dispersed by riot police in February 2011. Sultan Qaboos reacted by promising jobs and benefits. In October 2011, elections were held to the Consultative Assembly, to which Sultan Qaboos promised greater powers. The following year, the government began a crackdown on internet criticism. In September 2012, trials began of 'activists' accused of posting \"abusive and provocative\" criticism of the government online.

Omanis usually eat their main daily meal at midday, while the evening meal is lighter. During [[Ramadan]], dinner is served after the [[Taraweeh]] prayers, sometimes as late as 11&nbsp;pm. However, these dinner timings differ according to each family; for instance, some families would choose to eat right after [[maghrib]] prayers and have dessert after taraweeh.\n\nArsia, a festival meal served during celebrations, consists of mashed rice and meat (sometimes chicken). Another popular festival meal, shuwa, consists of meat cooked very slowly (sometimes for up to 2 days) in an underground clay oven. The meat becomes extremely tender and it is infused with spices and herbs before cooking to give it a very distinct taste. Fish is often used in main dishes too, and the [[Giant trevally|kingfish]] is a popular ingredient. Mashuai is a meal consisting of a whole spit-roasted kingfish served with lemon rice.\n\nRukhal bread is a thin, round bread originally baked over a fire made from palm leaves. It is eaten at any meal, typically served with Omani honey for breakfast or crumbled over curry for dinner. Chicken, fish, and lamb or mutton are regularly used in dishes. The Omani [[Halva|halwa]] is a very popular sweet, basically consisting of cooked raw sugar with nuts. There are many different flavors, the most popular ones being  black halwa (original) and saffron halwa. Halwa is considered as a symbol of Omani hospitality, and is traditionally served with coffee. As is the case with most [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]], alcohol is only available over-the-counter to non-Muslims. Muslims can still purchase alcoholic drinks. Alcohol is served in many hotels and a few restaurants.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:MuscatGulfCup2.jpg|thumb|left|Oman hosted and won the [[19th Arabian Gulf Cup]].]]\n\n[[File:Flickr - tpower1978 - World Cup Qualifiers (7).jpg|thumb|2010 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers Round 3 match between Oman and Japan at the Royal Oman Police Stadium on June 7, 2008 in Muscat, Oman]]\nIn October 2004, the Omani government set up a [[Ministry of Sports Affairs]] to replace the General Organization for youth, sports and cultural affairs.

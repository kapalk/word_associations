In 1893, it became a [[French colonial empire|French protectorate]], with the three territories uniting to form what is now known as the country of Laos. It briefly gained independence in 1945 after [[History of Laos to 1945#Japanese occupation of Laos|Japanese occupation]], but was recolonised by France until it won autonomy in 1949. Laos became independent in 1953, with a [[constitutional monarchy]] under [[Sisavang Vong]]. Shortly after independence, a long [[Laos Civil War|civil war]] began, which saw the [[Lao People's Revolutionary Party|communist resistance]], supported by the [[Soviet Union]], fight against, first, the monarchy and then a number of military dictatorships, supported by the [[United States]]. After the [[Vietnam War]] ended in 1975, the [[Communism|Communist]] [[Pathet Lao]] movement came to power, seeing the end to the civil war.

A number of famines, including the [[great Bengal famine of 1770]], occurred under company rule.

The provisional government issued the [[Proclamation of Bangladeshi Independence|Proclamation of the Independence of Bangladeshi]], which was the country's interim constitution and declared \"equality, human dignity and social justice\" as its fundamental principles. Due to Mujib's detention, the acting president was [[Syed Nazrul Islam]], while [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] was Bangladesh's first prime minister. The military wing of the provisional government was the [[Bangladesh Forces]] that included [[Mukti Bahini]] and other Bengali guerilla forces. Led by General [[M. A. G.

As a result, almost entire country except capital Dacca was liberated by [[Bangladesh Forces]] by late November. This led Pakistan Army to attack neighboring India's western front on 2 December. India retaliated both in western and eastern fronts. By joint Bangladeshi ground advance and Indian air strike, the rest capital Dacca was liberated from Pakistani occupation in mid December. During the last phase of the war, the Soviet Union and the United States dispatched naval forces to the Bay of Bengal in a Cold War standoff.

The northeast and southeast are home to [[evergreen]] hill ranges. The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''P\u00f4dda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the [[Bay of Bengal]].

Pre-Islamic Bengali architecture reached its pinnacle in the Pala Empire, when the Pala School of Sculptural Art established grand structures such as the Somapura Mahavihara.

The [[Mughal architecture|Mughal style]] replaced indigenous architecture when Bengal became a province of the Mughal Empire and influenced the development of urban housing. The [[Kantajew Temple]] and [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] are excellent examples of late medieval [[Hindu temple architecture]]. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]], based on Indo-Islamic styles, flourished during the British period. The zamindar gentry in Bangladesh built numerous Indo-Saracenic palaces and country mansions, such as the [[Ahsan Manzil]], [[Tajhat Palace]], [[Uttara Gonobhaban|Dighapatia Palace]], [[Puthia Rajbari]] and [[Natore Rajbari]].\n\nBengali [[vernacular architecture]] is noted for pioneering the [[bungalow]]. Bangladeshi villages consist of [[thatch]]ed roofed houses made of natural materials like [[mud]], [[straw]], wood and bamboo. In modern times, village bungalows are increasingly made of [[tin]].\n\n[[Muzharul Islam]] was the pioneer of Bangladeshi modern architecture. His varied works set the course of modern architectural practice in the country. Islam brought leading global architects, including [[Louis Kahn]], [[Richard Neutra]], [[Stanley Tigerman]], [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]], [[Robert Boughey]] and [[Konstantinos Apostolos Doxiadis|Konstantinos Doxiadis]], to work in erstwhile East Pakistan. Louis Kahn was chosen to design the National Parliament Complex in [[Sher-e-Bangla Nagar]]. Kahn's monumental designs, combining regional red brick aesthetics, his own concrete and marble [[brutalism]] and the use of lakes to represent Bengali geography, are regarded as one of the masterpieces of the 20th century.

In Chittagong, ''Mezban'' feasts are a popular tradition featuring the serving of hot beef [[curry]]. In Sylhet, the ''[[shatkora]]'' lemons are used to marinate dishes.

It is bordered by [[Nigeria]] to the west and north; [[Chad]] to the northeast; the [[Central African Republic]] to the east; and [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]] and the [[Republic of the Congo]] to the south. Cameroon's coastline lies on the [[Bight of Biafra]], part of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Although Cameroon is not an [[Economic Community of West African States|ECOWAS]] member state, it geographically and historically is in West Africa with the [[Southern Cameroons]] which now form her [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest]] and [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest]] Regions having a strong West African history. The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa.\n\nFrench and English are the official languages of Cameroon. The country is often referred to as \"Africa in miniature\" for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include [[beaches]], [[deserts]], [[mountains]], [[rainforests]], and [[savannas]]. The highest point at almost {{convert|4100|m|ft}} is [[Mount Cameroon]] in the [[Southwest Region (Cameroon)|Southwest Region]] of the country, and the largest cities in population-terms are [[Douala]] on the [[Wouri river]], its economic capital and main seaport, [[Yaound\u00e9]], its political capital, and [[Garoua]]. The country is well known for its native styles of music, particularly [[makossa]] and [[bikutsi]], and for its successful [[Cameroon national football team|national football team]].\n\nEarly inhabitants of the territory included the [[Sao civilisation]] around [[Lake Chad]] and the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] hunter-gatherers in the southeastern rainforest. [[Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese explorers]] reached the coast in the 15th century and named the area ''Rio dos Camar\u00f5es'' (''Shrimp River''), which became ''Cameroon'' in English. [[Fula people|Fulani]] soldiers founded the [[Adamawa Emirate]] in the north in the 19th century, and various ethnic groups of the west and northwest established powerful chiefdoms and [[fon (Cameroon)|fondoms]]. Cameroon became a [[German Empire|German colony]] in 1884 known as [[Kamerun]].\n\nAfter [[World War I]], the territory was divided between [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[British Empire|United Kingdom]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s. The [[Union of the Peoples of Cameroon|Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, leading to the [[Bamileke War]] fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President [[Ahmadou Ahidjo]]. The [[Southern Cameroons|southern part]] of [[British Cameroons]] federated with it in 1961 to form the [[Federal republic|Federal Republic]] of Cameroon. The federation was abandoned in 1972. The country was renamed the [[Unitary state|United Republic]] of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984. Large numbers of Cameroonians live as [[subsistence farmers]]. Since 1982 [[Paul Biya]] has been President, governing with his [[Cameroon People's Democratic Movement]] party. The country has experienced tensions coming from the English-speaking territories. Politicians in the English-speaking regions have advocated for greater decentralisation and even complete separation or independence (as in the [[Southern Cameroons National Council]]) from Cameroon. In 2017, tensions in the English-speaking territories escalated into [[Anglophone Crisis|open warfare]].\n\n== History ==\n\n{{Main|History of Cameroon}}\n\nThe territory of present-day Cameroon was first settled during the [[Neolithic]] Era. The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] ([[Pygmy peoples|Pygmies]]).<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 2.</ref> From here, [[Bantu expansion|Bantu migrations]] into eastern, southern, and central Africa are believed to have originated about 2,000 years ago.<ref name=\"history\"/> The [[Sao civilisation|Sao]] culture arose around [[Lake Chad]], c. 500 AD, and gave way to the [[Kanem Empire|Kanem]] and its successor state, the [[Bornu Empire]].

The labour was used on banana, rubber, palm oil, and cocoa plantations.<ref name=historyworld/> They initiated projects to improve the colony's infrastructure, relying on a harsh system of [[unfree labour|forced labour]], which was much criticised by the other colonial powers.<ref name=\"DeLancey 125\">[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 125.</ref>\n\n=== The 1900s ===\n\nWith the defeat of Germany in [[World War I]], Kamerun became a [[League of Nations mandate]] territory and was split into [[French Cameroons]] and [[British Cameroons]] in 1919.

Makossa developed in Douala and mixes folk music, highlife, [[soul music|soul]], and [[soukous|Congo music]]. Performers such as [[Manu Dibango]], [[Francis Bebey]], [[Moni Bil\u00e9]], and [[Petit-Pays]] popularised the style worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s. Bikutsi originated as war music among the Ewondo. Artists such as [[Anne-Marie Nzi\u00e9]] developed it into a popular dance music beginning in the 1940s, and performers such as [[Mama Ohandja]] and [[Les T\u00eates Brul\u00e9es]] popularised it internationally during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.<ref>[[#DeLancey|DeLancey and DeLancey]] 51</ref><ref name= Nkolo/>\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n\n{{Further|Cameroonian cuisine}}\n\n[[File:Woman weaving baskets near Lake Ossa.jpg|thumb|A woman weaves a basket near [[Lake Ossa]], Littoral Region. Cameroonians practise such handicrafts throughout the country.]]\n\n[[Cuisine of Cameroon|Cuisine]] varies by region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common throughout the country. A typical dish is based on cocoyams, [[maize]], [[cassava]] (manioc), [[millet]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[potato]]es, [[rice]], or [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], often pounded into dough-like [[fufu]]. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, [[groundnut]]s, [[palm oil]], or other ingredients.<ref>[[#West|West]] 84\u20135.</ref> Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions.<ref name=\"Mbaku 121-2\">[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 121\u20132.</ref> Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and [[Maggi]].<ref>[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1047</ref><ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 122</ref><ref>[[#West|West]] 84.</ref>\n\nCutlery is common, but food is traditionally manipulated with the right hand. Breakfast consists of leftovers of bread and fruit with [[coffee]] or [[tea]]. Generally breakfast is made from wheat flour in various different foods such as puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from [[banana]]s and flour, bean cakes and many more. Snacks are popular, especially in larger towns where they may be bought from [[street vendor]]s.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 121</ref><ref>[[#Hudgens|Hudgens and Trillo]] 1049.</ref>\n\nWater, [[palm wine]], and [[millet beer]] are the traditional mealtime drinks, although beer, soda, and wine have gained popularity. 33 Export beer is the official drink of the [[Cameroon national football team|national soccer team]] and one of the most popular brands, joining Castel, [[Amstel Brewery]], and [[Guinness Foreign Extra Stout|Guinness]].\n\n=== Local arts and crafts ===\n\nTraditional arts and crafts are practiced throughout the country for commercial, decorative, and religious purposes. Woodcarvings and sculptures are especially common.<ref>[[#West|West]] 17.</ref> The high-quality clay of the western highlands is suitable for pottery and ceramics.<ref name=\"West 18\"/> Other crafts include [[basket weaving]], beadworking, brass and bronze working, calabash carving and painting, embroidery, and leather working. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials and vary from temporary wood-and-leaf shelters of nomadic [[Wodaabe|Mbororo]] to the rectangular mud-and-thatch homes of southern peoples. Dwellings made from materials such as cement and tin are increasingly common.<ref>[[#Mbaku|Mbaku]] 110\u20133.</ref> [[Contemporary art]] is mainly promoted by independent cultural organizations ([[Doual'art]], [[Africr\u00e9a]]) and [[artist-run initiative]]s ([[Art Wash]], [[Atelier Viking]], [[ArtBakery]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|accessdate=12 April 2013|work=The Post|author=Mulenga, Andrew|date=30 April 2010|title=Cameroon's indomitable contemporary art|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311124956/http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=8690|archivedate=11 March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Literature ===\n\n{{Main|Literature of Cameroon}}\n\nCameroonian literature has concentrated on both European and African themes.

The [[Cameroon national football team|national team]] has been one of the most successful in Africa since its strong showing in the [[1982 Football World Cup|1982]] and [[1990 FIFA World Cup]]s.

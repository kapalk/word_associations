Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the party-aligned members of the DPR and the non-partisan DPD.<ref name=\"INAlegis\"/><ref name=\"Harijanti2006\"/> Beginning with [[Indonesian local elections, 2015|2015 local elections]], Indonesia starts to elect governors and mayors simultaneously on the same date.\n\n===Political divisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Indonesia}}\nIndonesia consists of 34 provinces, five of which have special status. Each province has its own legislature (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah'', DPRD) and an elected governor. The provinces are subdivided into regencies (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kabupaten]]'') and cities (''[[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|kota]]''), led by regents (''bupati'') and mayors (''walikota'') respectively and also their own legislature (''DPRD Kabupaten/Kota''). These are further subdivided into [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan'' or ''distrik'' in [[Western New Guinea|Papua]]), and again into administrative villages (either ''desa'', ''kelurahan'', ''kampung'', ''nagari'' in West Sumatra, or ''gampong'' in Aceh). This number has evolved over time, the most recent change being the split of [[North Kalimantan]] from [[East Kalimantan]] in October 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/house-agrees-on-creation-of-indonesias-34th-province-north-kalimantan/|title=House Agrees on Creation of Indonesia's 34th Province: 'North Kalimantan'|publisher=The Jakarta Globe|date=22 October 2012|accessdate=16 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816153022/http://jakartaglobe.id/archive/house-agrees-on-creation-of-indonesias-34th-province-north-kalimantan/|archivedate=16 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe village is the lowest level of government administration. Furthermore, it is divided into several community groups (''rukun warga'', RW) which are further divided into neighbourhood groups (''rukun tetangga'', RT). In Java, the village (''desa'') is divided into smaller units called ''dusun'' or ''dukuh'' (hamlets), which are the same as RW. Following the implementation of regional autonomy measures in 2001, regencies and cities have become key administrative units, responsible for providing most government services. The village administration level is the most influential on a citizen's daily life and handles matters of a village or neighbourhood through an elected village chief (''lurah'' or ''kepala desa'').\n\n[[Aceh]], [[Jakarta]], [[Special Region of Yogyakarta|Yogyakarta]], [[Papua (province)|Papua]], and [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] have greater legislative privileges and a higher degree of autonomy from the central government than the other provinces. Aceh has the right to create certain elements of an independent legal system and several regional parties participate only in elections within the province.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/18/finally-aceh-local-parties-take-part-general-election.html|title=Finally, Aceh local parties to take part in general election|author=Simanjuntak, Hotli|publisher=The Jakarta Post|date=18 August 2008|accessdate=16 August 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816151421/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/08/18/finally-aceh-local-parties-take-part-general-election.html|archivedate=16 August 2017}}</ref> In 2003, it instituted a form of ''[[sharia]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Michelle Ann Miller|title=The Nanggroe Aceh Darussalam law: a serious response to Acehnese separatism?|journal=Asian Ethnicity|volume=5|issue=3|year=2004|pages=333\u2013351|doi=10.1080/1463136042000259789}}</ref> Yogyakarta was granted the status of Special Region in recognition of its pivotal role in supporting the Republicans during the National Revolution and its willingness to join Indonesia as a republic.<ref>The positions of governor and its vice governor are prioritised for descendants of the [[Sultan of Yogyakarta]] and [[Pakualaman|Paku Alam]], respectively, much like a [[sultanate]].

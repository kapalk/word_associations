Most of the country was [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquered by the Spanish]] in the 16th century, becoming part of the [[viceroyalty]] of [[New Spain]]. Guatemala attained independence in 1821 as part of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], which dissolved by 1841.\n\nFrom the mid to late 19th century, Guatemala experienced chronic instability and civil strife. Beginning in the early 20th century, it was ruled by a series of dictators backed by the [[United Fruit Company]] and the United States government. In 1944, authoritarian leader [[Jorge Ubico]] was overthrown by a pro-democratic military coup, initiating a [[Guatemalan Revolution|decade-long revolution]] that led to sweeping social and economic reforms. A [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'\u00e9tat|U.S.-backed military coup]] in 1954 ended the revolution and installed a dictatorship.{{sfn|Blakeley|2009|p=92}}\n\nFrom 1960 to 1996, Guatemala [[Guatemalan Civil War|endured a bloody civil war]] fought between the US-backed government and [[leftist]] rebels, including [[Guatemalan genocide|genocidal massacres]] of the Maya population perpetrated by the military.{{sfn|Cooper|2008|p=171}}{{sfn|Solano|2012|p=3\u201315}}{{sfn|Navarro|1999}} Since a [[United Nations]]-negotiated peace accord, Guatemala has witnessed both economic growth and successful democratic elections, though it continues to struggle with high rates of poverty, crime, drug trade, and instability. {{as of|2014}}, Guatemala ranks 31st of 33 Latin American and Caribbean countries in terms of the [[Human Development Index]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|title=Human Development Index (HDI) {{!}} Human Development Reports|website=hdr.undp.org|access-date=15 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128091411/http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi|archive-date=28 January 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGuatemala's abundance of biologically significant and unique ecosystems includes a large number of endemic species and contributes to [[Mesoamerica]]'s designation as a [[biodiversity hotspot]].{{sfn|Conservation International|2007|p=}}\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe name \"Guatemala\" comes from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''Cuauht\u0113mall\u0101n'' [[:nah:Cuauht\u0113mall\u0101n|(nahwiki)]], or \"place of many trees\", a derivative of the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Mayan]] word for \"many trees\"{{sfn|Campbell|1997|p=}}{{sfn|Troika study abroad programs|2006|p=}} or perhaps more specifically for the Cuate/Cuatli tree [[Eysenhardtia]].

The capital was moved to [[Ciudad Vieja]] on 22 November 1527, as a result of a Kaqchikel attack on Villa de Santiago de Guatemala.\n\nOn 11 September 1541, the new capital was flooded when the lagoon in the [[Volcanic crater|crater]] of the [[Volc\u00e1n de Agua|Agua Volcano]] collapsed due to heavy rains and earthquakes; the capital was then moved {{convert|4|mi|km|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} to [[Antigua Guatemala|Antigua]] in the Panchoy Valley, now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

Instead, Moraz\u00e1n left Carrera in charge of a small fort in Mita, without any weapons.

Zavala not only did not capture him, he agreed to serve under his orders, thus sending a strong message to both liberal and conservatives in Guatemala City that they would have to negotiate with Carrera or battle on two fronts \u2013 Quetzaltenango and Jalapa.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=278}} Carrera went back to the Quetzaltenango area, while Zavala remained in [[Suchitep\u00e9quez]] as a tactical maneuver.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=}} Carrera received a visit from a cabinet member of Paredes and told him that he had control of the native population and that he assured Paredes that he would keep them appeased.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=278}} When the emissary returned to Guatemala City, he told the president everything Carrera said, and added that the native forces were formidable.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=279}}\n\nGuzm\u00e1n went to [[Antigua Guatemala]] to meet with another group of Paredes emissaries; they agreed that Los Altos would rejoin Guatemala, and that the latter would help Guzm\u00e1n defeat his enemy and also build a port on the Pacific Ocean.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=279}} Guzm\u00e1n was sure of victory this time, but his plan evaporated when in his absence Carrera and his native allies occupied Quetzaltenango; Carrera appointed Ignacio Yrigoyen as [[Corregidor (position)|Corregidor]] and convinced him that he should work with the K'iche', Q'anjobal and [[Mam people|Mam]] leaders to keep the region under control.{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=280}} On his way out, Yrigoyen murmured to a friend: \"Now he is the king of the Indians, indeed!\"{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez Davison|2008|p=280}}\n\nGuzm\u00e1n then left for Jalapa, where he struck a deal with the rebels, while [[Luis Batres Juarros]] convinced President Paredes to deal with Carrera. Back in Guatemala City within a few months, Carrera was commander-in-chief, backed by military and political support of the Indian communities from the densely populated western highlands.{{sfn|Weaver|1999|p=138}} During the first presidency, from 1844 to 1848, he brought the country back from excessive conservatism to a moderate regime, and \u2013 with the advice of Juan Jos\u00e9 de Aycinena y Pi\u00f1ol and [[Pedro de Aycinena]] \u2013 restored relations with the Church in Rome with a [[Concordat of 1854|Concordat]] ratified in 1854.{{sfn|Calvert|1985|p=36}}\n\n=== Second Carrera government (1851\u20131865) ===\n[[File:Carrerayturcios 2014-06-22 09-46.jpg|thumb|Captain General [[Rafael Carrera]] after being appointed President for Life in 1854.]]\n\nAfter Carrera returned from exile in 1849 the president of El Salvador, [[Doroteo Vasconcelos]], granted asylum to the Guatemalan liberals, who harassed the Guatemalan government in several different ways. Jos\u00e9 Francisco Barrundia established a liberal newspaper for that specific purpose. Vasconcelos supported a rebel faction named \"La Monta\u00f1a\" in eastern Guatemala, providing and distributing money and weapons. By late 1850, Vasconcelos was getting impatient at the slow progress of the war with Guatemala and decided to plan an open attack. Under that circumstance, the Salvadorean head of state started a campaign against the conservative Guatemalan regime, inviting [[Honduras]] and [[Nicaragua]] to participate in the alliance; only the [[Honduras|Honduran]] government led by [[Juan Lindo]] accepted.{{sfn|Hern\u00e1ndez de Le\u00f3n|1930|p=}} In 1851 Guatemala defeated an Allied army from Honduras and El Salvador at the [[Battle of La Arada]].\n\nIn 1854 Carrera was declared \"supreme and perpetual leader of the nation\" for life, with the power to choose his successor. He held that position until he died on 14 April 1865. While he pursued some measures to set up a foundation for economic prosperity to please the conservative landowners, military challenges at home and a three-year war with Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua dominated his presidency.\n\nHis rivalry with Gerardo Barrios, President of El Salvador, resulted in open war in 1863. At [[Coatepeque, Quetzaltenango|Coatepeque]] the Guatemalans suffered a severe defeat, which was followed by a truce. Honduras joined with El Salvador, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica with Guatemala. The contest was finally settled in favor of Carrera, who besieged and occupied [[San Salvador]], and dominated Honduras and Nicaragua. He continued to act in concert with the [[Clerical Party]], and tried to maintain friendly relations with European governments. Before he died, Carrera nominated his friend and loyal soldier, Army Marshall [[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]], as his successor.\n\n=== Vicente Cerna y Cerna regime (1865\u20131871) ===\n[[File:VicenteCerna.jpg|thumb|[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was the president of Guatemala from 1865 to 1871.]]\n{{Further|Vicente Cerna y Cerna}}\n[[Vicente Cerna y Cerna]] was [[president of Guatemala]] from 24 May 1865 to 29 June 1871.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |title       = Vicente Cerna\n |author      = prensalibre.com\n |accessdate  = 5 September 2014\n |deadurl     = yes\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150106175325/http://www.prensalibre.com/economia/economia_0_718128187.html\n |archivedate = 6 January 2015\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref> Liberal author {{ILL|Alfonso Enrique Barrientos|es}},{{sfn|Barrientos|1948|p=106}} {{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}} described Marshall Cerna's government in the following manner:{{sfn|Barrientos|s.f.|p=106}}{{Full citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n{{quote|A conservative and archaic government, badly organized and with worse intentions, was in charge of the country, centralizing all powers in Vicente Cerna, ambitious military man, who not happy with the general rank, had promoted himself to the Army Marshall rank, even though that rank did not exist and it does not exist in the Guatemalan military. The Marshall called himself President of the Republic, but in reality he was the foreman of oppressed and savaged people, cowardly enough that they had not dared to tell the dictator to leave threatening him with a revolution.}}\n\nThe State and Church were a single unit, and the conservative r\u00e9gime was strongly allied to the power of [[regular clergy]] of the [[Catholic Church]], who were then among the largest landowners in Guatemala.

During this era coffee became an important crop for Guatemala.{{sfn|Foster|2000|pp=173\u2013175}} Barrios had ambitions of reuniting Central America and took the country to war in an unsuccessful attempt to attain it, losing his life on the battlefield in 1885 against forces in El Salvador.\n\n[[Manuel Barillas]] was president from 16 March 1886 to 15 March 1892. Manuel Barillas was unique among liberal presidents of Guatemala between 1871 and 1944: he handed over power to his successor peacefully. When election time approached, he sent for the three Liberal candidates to ask them what their government plan would be.{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Happy with what he heard from general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reyna Barrios|Reyna Barrios]],{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=78}} Barillas made sure that a huge column of Quetzaltenango and Totonicap\u00e1n indigenous people came down from the mountains to vote for him. Reyna was elected president. {{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p = 82}}\n\n[[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] was President between 1892 and 1898. During Barrios's first term in office, the power of the landowners over the rural peasantry increased. He oversaw the rebuilding of parts of [[Guatemala City]] on a grander scale, with wide, Parisian-style avenues. He oversaw Guatemala hosting the first \"[[Exposici\u00f3n Centroamericana]]\" (\"Central American Fair\") in 1897. During his second term, Barrios printed [[bond (finance)|bond]]s to fund his ambitious plans, fueling [[monetary inflation]] and the rise of popular opposition to his regime.\n\nHis administration also worked on improving the roads, installing national and international telegraphs and introducing electricity to Guatemala City. Completing a transoceanic railway was a main objective of his government, with a goal to attract international investors at a time when the [[Panama Canal]] was not built yet.\n\n=== Manuel Estrada Cabrera regime (1898\u20131920) ===\n{{Main|Manuel Estrada Cabrera}}\n\n[[File:Manuel Estrada Cabrera.jpg|thumb|[[Manuel Estrada Cabrera]] ruled Guatemala between 1898 and 1920.]]\nAfter the assassination of general [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Reina Barrios]] on 8 February 1898, the Guatemalan cabinet called an emergency meeting to appoint a new successor, but declined to invite Estrada Cabrera to the meeting, even though he was the designated successor to the Presidency. There are two different descriptions of how Cabrera was able to become president. The first states that Cabrera entered the cabinet meeting \"with pistol drawn\" to assert his entitlement to the presidency,{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=54}} while the second states that he showed up unarmed to the meeting and demanded the presidency by virtue of being the designated successor.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=42}}\n\nThe first civilian Guatemalan head of state in over 50 years, Estrada Cabrera overcame resistance to his regime by August 1898 and called for elections in September, which he won handily.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=46}} In 1898 the Legislature convened for the election of President Estrada Cabrera, who triumphed thanks to the large number of soldiers and policemen who went to vote in civilian clothes and to the large number of illiterate family that they brought with them to the polls.{{sfn|Torres Espinoza|2007|p=42}}\n\nOne of Estrada Cabrera's most famous and most bitter legacies was allowing the entry of the [[United Fruit Company]] (UFCO) into the Guatemalan economic and political arena. As a member of the [[Liberalism in Latin America|Liberal Party]], he sought to encourage development of the nation's infrastructure of [[highway]]s, [[railroad]]s, and [[sea port]]s for the sake of expanding the export economy. By the time Estrada Cabrera assumed the presidency there had been repeated efforts to construct a railroad from the major port of [[Puerto Barrios]] to the capital, Guatemala City. Due to lack of funding exacerbated by the collapse of the internal coffee trade, the railway fell {{convert|60|mi|km|sigfig=1|order=flip}} short of its goal. Estrada Cabrera decided, without consulting the legislature or judiciary, that striking a deal with the UFCO was the only way to finish the railway.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=}} Cabrera signed a contract with UFCO's [[Minor Cooper Keith]] in 1904 that gave the company tax exemptions, land grants, and control of all railroads on the Atlantic side.{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=}}\n\nEstrada Cabrera often employed brutal methods to assert his authority. Right at the beginning of his first presidential period he started prosecuting his political rivals and soon established a well-organized web of spies. One American ambassador returned to the United States after he learned the dictator had given orders to poison him. Former President [[Manuel Barillas]] was stabbed to death in Mexico City. Estrada Cabrera responded violently to workers' strikes against UFCO. In one incident, when UFCO went directly to Estrada Cabrera to resolve a strike (after the armed forces refused to respond), the president ordered an armed unit to enter a workers' compound. The forces \"arrived in the night, firing indiscriminately into the workers' sleeping quarters, wounding and killing an unspecified number.\"{{sfn|Chapman|2007|p=83}}\n\nIn 1906 Estrada faced serious revolts against his rule; the rebels were supported by the governments of some of the other [[Central America]]n nations, but Estrada succeeded in putting them down. Elections were held by the people against the will of Estrada Cabrera and thus he had the president-elect murdered in retaliation. In 1907 Estrada narrowly survived an assassination attempt when a bomb exploded near his carriage.{{sfn|de Aerenlund|2006|p=}} It has been suggested that the extreme despotic characteristics of Estrada did not emerge until after an attempt on his life in 1907.{{sfn|Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|1945|p=146}}\n\n[[Guatemala City]] was badly damaged in the [[1917 Guatemala earthquake]].\n\nEstrada Cabrera continued in power until forced to resign after new revolts in 1920. By that time his power had declined drastically and he was reliant upon the loyalty of a few generals. While the United States threatened intervention if he was removed through revolution, a bipartisan coalition came together to remove him from the presidency. He was removed from office after the national assembly charged that he was mentally incompetent, and appointed Carlos Herrera in his place on 8 April 1920.{{sfn|Dosal|1993|p=27}}\n\n=== Jorge Ubico regime (1931\u20131944) ===\n{{Main|Jorge Ubico}}\nThe [[Great Depression]] began in 1929 and badly damaged the Guatemalan economy, causing a rise in [[unemployment]], and leading to unrest among workers and laborers. Afraid of a popular revolt, the Guatemalan landed elite lent their support to [[Jorge Ubico]], who had become well known for \"efficiency and cruelty\" as a provincial governor. Ubico won the election that followed in 1931, in which he was the only candidate.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=12\u201315}}{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|pp=10\u201311}} After his election his policies quickly became authoritarian. He replaced the system of debt [[peon]]age with a brutally enforced [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] law, requiring all men of working age who did not own land to work a minimum of 100 days of hard labor.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} His government used unpaid Indian labor to build roads and railways. Ubico also froze wages at very low levels, and passed a law allowing land-owners complete immunity from prosecution for any action they took to defend their property,{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=29}} an action described by historians as legalizing murder.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=13}} He greatly strengthened the police force, turning it into one of the most efficient and ruthless in Latin America.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=17}} He gave them greater authority to shoot and imprison people suspected of breaking the labor laws. These laws created tremendous resentment against him among agricultural laborers.{{sfn|Forster|2001|pp=29\u201332}} The government became highly militarized; under his rule, every provincial governor was a general in the army.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=14}}\n\nUbico continued his predecessor's policy of making massive concessions to the [[United Fruit Company]], often at a cost to Guatemala. He granted the company {{convert|200,000|ha|acre}} of public land in exchange for a promise to build a port, a promise he later waived.{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=22}} Since its entry into Guatemala, the United Fruit Company had expanded its land-holdings by displacing farmers and converting their farmland to [[banana plantation]]s. This process accelerated under Ubico's presidency, with the government doing nothing to stop it.{{sfn|Forster|2001|p=19}} The company received import duty and real estate tax exemptions from the government and controlled more land than any other individual or group. It also controlled the sole railroad in the country, the sole facilities capable of producing electricity, and the port facilities at [[Puerto Barrios]] on the Atlantic coast.{{sfn|Schlesinger|Kinzer|1999|pp=67\u201371}}\n\nUbico saw the United States as an ally against the supposed communist threat of Mexico, and made efforts to gain its support. When the US declared war against Germany in 1941, Ubico acted on American instructions and arrested all people in Guatemala of [[German Guatemalan|German descent]].{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=20}} He also permitted the US to establish an air base in Guatemala, with the stated aim of protecting the [[Panama Canal]].{{sfn|Immerman|1982|p=37}} However, Ubico was an admirer of European [[fascist]]s, such as [[Francisco Franco]] and [[Benito Mussolini]],{{sfn|Gleijeses|1991|p=19}} and considered himself to be \"another [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]\".{{sfn|De los R\u00edos|1948|p=98}} He occasionally compared himself to [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Shillington|2002|pp=38\u201339}} He dressed ostentatiously and surrounded himself with statues and paintings of Napoleon, regularly commenting on the similarities between their appearances.

Two mountain chains enter Guatemala from west to east, dividing Guatemala into three major regions: the highlands, where the mountains are located; the Pacific coast, south of the mountains and the Pet\u00e9n region, north of the mountains.\n\nAll major cities are located in the highlands and Pacific coast regions; by comparison, Pet\u00e9n is sparsely populated. These three regions vary in climate, elevation, and landscape, providing dramatic contrasts between hot, humid tropical lowlands and colder, drier highland peaks. [[Volc\u00e1n Tajumulco]], at {{convert|4,220|m|abbr=off}}, is the highest point in the Central American countries.\n\nThe rivers are short and shallow in the Pacific drainage basin, larger and deeper in the Caribbean and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] drainage basins. These rivers include the [[Polochic River|Polochic]] and [[Dulce River (Guatemala)|Dulce Rivers]], which drain into [[Lake Izabal]], the [[Motagua River]], the Sarst\u00fan, which forms the boundary with Belize, and the [[Usumacinta River]], which forms the boundary between Pet\u00e9n and [[Chiapas]], Mexico.\n\n===Natural disasters===\n{{For|the 2018 volcanic eruption|2018 Volc\u00e1n de Fuego eruption}}\n[[File:guatemala town volcanic crater.jpg|thumb|A town along the [[Pan-American Highway]] within a volcanic crater.]]\nGuatemala's location between the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean makes it a target for hurricanes such as [[Hurricane Mitch]] in 1998 and [[Hurricane Stan]] in October 2005, which killed more than 1,500 people. The damage was not wind-related, but rather due to significant [[flooding]] and resulting [[mudflow|mudslides]]. The most recent was [[Tropical Storm Agatha (2010)|Tropical Storm Agatha]] in late May 2010, which killed more than 200.\n\nGuatemala's highlands lie along the [[Motagua Fault]], part of the boundary between the [[Caribbean Plate|Caribbean]] and [[North American Plate|North American]] [[tectonic plates]]. This fault has been responsible for several major earthquakes in historic times, including a 7.5 magnitude tremor on 4 February 1976 which killed more than 25,000 people. In addition, the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction zone]] lies off the Pacific coast. Here, the [[Cocos Plate]] is sinking beneath the Caribbean Plate, producing volcanic activity inland of the coast. Guatemala has 37 volcanoes, four of them active: [[Pacaya]], [[Santiaguito]], [[Volc\u00e1n de Fuego|Fuego]], and [[Volc\u00e1n Tacan\u00e1|Tacan\u00e1]].\n\nNatural disasters have a long history in this geologically active part of the world.

Historical tourism includes the colonial city of [[Antigua Guatemala]], which is recognized as a UNESCO Cultural Heritage site.\n\nThere is a strong interest within the international community for archaeological sites like the city of Tikal. To note, Tikal was built and inhabited in a period where the culture had its greatest literary and artistic expression, and was ruled by a dynasty of 16 kings. The Maya of Tikal built many temples, a ball park, altars and stelae in high and low relief.\n\nGuatemala is visited for its archaeological sites, pre-Hispanic cities as well as tourist-religious centers like the Basilica of Esquipulas in the city of Esquipulas, and the beaches on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Guatemala.

Originating from political reasons, these processes have aided the revival of some Mayan languages and advanced bilingual education in the country.\n\nIn 1945, in order to overcome \"the Indian problem\", the Guatemalan government founded The Institute Indigents ta National (NH), the purpose of which was to teach literacy to Mayan children in their mother tongue instead of Spanish, to prepare the ground for later assimilation of the latter. The teaching of literacy in the first language, which received support from the UN, significantly advanced in 1952, when the SIL (Summer Institute of Linguistics), located in Dallas, Texas, partnered with the Guatemalan Ministry of Education; within 2 years, numerous written works in Mayan languages had been printed and published, and vast advancement was done in the translation of the New Testament. Further efforts to integrate the indigenous into the Ladino<ref>Heimberger, Janet L. Language and Ethnicity: Multiple Literacies in Context, Language Education in Guatemala. ''Bilingual Research Journal''. Vol. 30, Issue 1, pp. 65\u201386, 2006.</ref> society were made in the following years, including the invention of a special alphabet to assist Mayan students transition to Spanish, and bilingual education in the Q'eqchi' area. When Spanish became the official language of Guatemala in 1965, the government started several programs, such as the Bilingual [[Castellanizaci\u00f3n|Castellanizacion]] Program and the Radiophonic Schools, to accelerate the move of Mayan students to Spanish. Unintentionally, the efforts to integrate the indigenous using language, especially the new alphabet, gave institutions tools to use Mayan tongues in schools, and while improving Mayan children's learning, they left them unequipped to learn in a solely Spanish environment. So, an additional expansion of bilingual education took place in 1980, when an experimental program in which children were to be instructed in their mother tongue until they are fluent enough in Spanish was created. The program proved successful when the students of the pilot showed higher academic achievements than the ones in the Spanish-only control schools. In 1987, when the pilot was to finish, bilingual education was made official in Guatemala.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\n{{Largest cities of Guatemala}}\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{Main|Religion in Guatemala}}\n[[File:Catedral Metropolitana, Guatemala City.jpg|thumb|The [[Cathedral of Guatemala City|Catedral Metropolitana]], Guatemala City.]]\n\n[[Christianity]] continues to remain strong and vital for the life of [[Demographics of Guatemala|Guatemalan society]], but its composition has changed over generations of social and political unrest. [[Roman Catholicism]], introduced by the Spanish during the colonial era, remains the largest denomination or church, accounting for 48.4% of the population {{As of|2007|lc=y}}. [[Protestants]], most of them [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] (most Protestants are called ''Evangelicos'' in Latin America) in a wide number of different denominations, made up 33.7% of the population at that time, followed by 1.6% in other religions (such as [[Jews in Guatemala|Judaism]], [[Islam in Guatemala|Islam]], and [[Buddhism]]), and 16.1% claiming no religious affiliation. A more recent 2012 survey reveals Catholics at 47.6%, Protestants at 38.2%, other religions at 2.6%, and the non-religious at 11.6%.\n\nSince the 1970s, and particularly since the 1990s, Guatemala has experienced the rapid growth of Evangelical Protestantism, whose adherents currently form more than 38% of the population, and still growing, in different denominations.\n\nOver the past two decades, particularly since the end of the civil war, Guatemala has seen heightened missionary activity. Protestant denominations have grown markedly in recent decades, chiefly [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and [[Pentecostal]] varieties; growth is particularly strong among the ethnic Maya population, with the [[National Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Guatemala]] maintaining 11 indigenous-language presbyteries. [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has grown from 40,000 members in 1984 to 164,000 in 1998, and continues to expand.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lds.org/church/temples/quetzaltenango-guatemala |title=Quetzaltenango Guatemala |publisher=Lds.org |accessdate=3 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203152656/https://www.lds.org/church/temples/quetzaltenango-guatemala |archive-date=3 February 2015 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/quetzaltenango/ |title=Quetzaltenango Guatemala LDS (Mormon) Temple |publisher=Ldschurchtemples.com |accessdate=3 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601200123/http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/quetzaltenango/ |archivedate=1 June 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe growth of [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox Church]] in Guatemala has been especially strong, with hundreds of thousands of converts in the last five years,<ref name=EOC3>{{cite web |last1=Jackson |first1=Fr.

Subsequently, Guatemala received waves of immigration from Europe in the mid 19th century and early 20th century.{{clarify|date=June 2015}} Primarily from Germany, these immigrants installed coffee and cardamom [[fincas]] in [[Alta Verapaz]], [[Zacapa]], [[Quetzaltenango]], [[Baja Verapaz]] and [[Izabal Department|Izabal]]. To a lesser extent people also arrived from Spain, France, Belgium, England, Italy, Sweden, etc.\n\nMany European immigrants to Guatemala were politicians, refugees, and entrepreneurs as well as families looking to settle. Up to 1950 Guatemala was the Central American country that received the most immigrants, behind [[Costa Rica]], and large numbers of immigrants are still received today.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}\nSince the 1890s there have been small communities of Asians (in particular from [[Korea]], China, Japan, [[Singapore]], and the [[Philippines]]) but in recent decades this has been growing. Also, beginning with the [[First World War]], the immigrant population is being strengthened by [[Jewish]] immigration.\n\nDuring the second half of the twentieth century, Latin American immigration grew in Guatemala, particularly from other [[Central American]] countries, Mexico, Cuba, and Argentina, although most of these immigrants stayed only temporarily before going to their final destinations in the United States.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n<center>\n{|class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Certain foods are also commonly eaten on certain days of the week; for example, a popular custom is to eat ''paches'' (a kind of tamale made from potatoes) on Thursday. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as [[fiambre]] for [[All Saints' Day]] on 1 November, or tamales and ''ponche'' ([[Punch (drink)|fruit punch]]), which are both very common around Christmas.\n\n=== Sports ===\n==== Football ====\n{{Main|Football in Guatemala}}\n[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Guatemala and its [[Guatemala national football team|national team]] has appeared in 18 editions of the [[CONCACAF Championship]], winning it once, in [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]].

Its [[Guatemala national futsal team|national team]] won the [[2008 CONCACAF Futsal Championship]] as hosts. It was also the runner-up in [[2012 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2012]] as hosts and won the bronze medal in [[2016 CONCACAF Futsal Championship|2016]].\n\nGuatemala participated for the first time in the [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] in [[2000 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2000]], as hosts, and has played in every competition from [[2008 FIFA Futsal World Cup|2008]] onwards.

Guatemala participated in the [[Guatemala at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Summer Olympics]], and in every edition since the [[Guatemala at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Summer Olympics]]. It has also appeared in a single [[Winter Olympics]] edition, in [[Guatemala at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]].\n\n[[Erick Barrondo]] won the only Olympic medal for Guatemala so far, silver in [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 20 kilometres walk|race walking]] at the [[Guatemala at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==== Other sports ====\nGuatemala also keeps [[National sports teams of Guatemala|national sports teams]] in several disciplines.\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Guatemala|Latin America}}\n* [[Index of Guatemala-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of Guatemala]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Aguirre |first=Lily |title=The land of eternal spring: Guatemala, my beautiful country |year=1949 |publisher=Patio Press |page=253 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LodnAAAAMAAJ|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|first=Rafael|last=Ar\u00e9valo Martinez|title=\u00a1Ecce Pericles!|publisher= Tipograf\u00eda Nacional|location=Guatemala|year= 1945|ref=harv|language=Spanish|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/190285559/Arevalo-Martinez-Ecce-Pericles#scribd}}\n* {{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/concordatoen00unseguat|last=Aycinena|first=Pedro de|author-link=Pedro de Aycinena|title=Concordato entre la Santa Sede y el presidente de la Rep\u00fablica de Guatemala|publisher=Imprenta La Paz|year=1854|location=Guatemala|language=Latin, Spanish|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite web|author=Banco de Guatemala |url=http://www.banguat.gob.gt/inc/ver.asp?id=/en/currency%20and%20bills/Monedas%20y%20Billetes%20Translation.htm&e=18108 |title=Ilustraciones de Cada una de las 11 Denominaciones.

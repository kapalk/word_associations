It has a shared cultural history with two other island regions: [[Polynesia]] to the east and [[Melanesia]] to the south.\n\nThe region has a [[tropical marine climate]] and is part of the [[Oceania ecozone]]. There are four main [[archipelago]]s along with numerous outlying islands.\n\nMicronesia is divided politically among several sovereign countries. One of these is the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], which is often called \"Micronesia\" for short and is not to be confused with the overall region. The Micronesia region encompasses five sovereign, independent nations\u2014the Federated States of Micronesia, [[Palau]], [[Kiribati]], the [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Nauru]]\u2014as well as three [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]] in the northern part: [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Guam]] and [[Wake Island]].\n\nMicronesia [[Austronesian peoples#Migration and dispersion|began to be settled several millennia ago]], although there are competing theories about the origin and arrival of the first settlers.{{sfn|Kirch|2001|p=167}} The earliest known contact with Europeans occurred in 1521, when Spain reached the [[Marianas]]. The coinage of the term \"Micronesia\" is usually attributed to [[Jules Dumont d'Urville]]'s usage in 1832; however, Domeny de Rienzi had used the term a year previously.{{sfn|Rainbird|2004|p=6}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Pacific Culture Areas.png|thumb|right|250px|Micronesia is one of three major cultural areas in the [[Pacific Ocean]], along with [[Polynesia]] and [[Melanesia]]]]\nMicronesia is a region that includes approximately 2100 islands, with a total land area of {{convert|2,700|km2|abbr=on}}, the largest of which is [[Guam]], which covers {{convert|582|km2|abbr=on}}. The total ocean area within the perimeter of the islands is {{convert|7,400,000|km2|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Kirch|2001|p=165}}\n\nThere are four main island groups in Micronesia:\n* the [[Caroline Islands]] ([[Federated States of Micronesia]] and [[Palau]])\n* the [[Gilbert Islands]] ([[Kiribati|Republic of Kiribati]])\n* the [[Mariana Islands]] ([[Northern Mariana Islands]] and [[Guam]])\n* the [[Marshall Islands]]\n\nPlus the island country of [[Nauru]].\n\n===Caroline Islands===\nThe [[Caroline Islands]] are a widely scattered [[archipelago]] consisting of about 500 small [[coral island]]s, north of [[New Guinea]] and east of the [[Philippines]]. The Carolines consist of two states: the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], consisting of approximately 600 islands on the eastern side of the chain with Kosrae being the most eastern and [[Palau]] consisting of 250 islands on the western side.\n\n===Gilbert Islands===\nThe [[Gilbert Islands]] are a chain of sixteen [[atoll]]s and coral islands, arranged in an approximate north-to-south line. In a geographical sense, the [[equator]] serves as the dividing line between the northern Gilbert Islands and the southern Gilbert Islands. The [[Kiribati|Republic of Kiribati]] contains all of the Gilberts, as well as the island of [[Tarawa]], the site of the country's capital.\n\n===Mariana Islands===\nThe [[Mariana Islands]] are an arc-shaped [[archipelago]] made up by the summits of fifteen volcanic mountains. The island chain arises as a result of the western edge of the [[Pacific Plate]] moving westward and plunging downward below the [[Mariana plate]], a region which is the most volcanically active convergent plate boundary on Earth. The Marianas were politically divided in 1898, when the United States acquired title to [[Guam]] under the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris, 1898]], which ended the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. Spain then sold the remaining northerly islands to [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1899. Germany lost all of her colonies at the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] became a [[League of Nations]] Mandate, with [[Japan]] as the mandatory. After [[World War II]], the islands were transferred into the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Trust Territories|Trust Territory]] System, with the [[United States]] as Trustee. In 1976, the Northern Mariana Islands and the United States entered into a covenant of political union under which commonwealth status was granted the Northern Mariana Islands and its residents received United States citizenship.\n\n===Marshall Islands===\n[[File:Laura beach n tree (170671778).jpg|thumb|Beach scenery at [[Laura, Marshall Islands|Laura]], [[Majuro]], Marshall Islands]]\nThe [[Marshall Islands]] are located north of [[Nauru]] and [[Kiribati]], east of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] and south of the U.S. territory of [[Wake Island]]. The islands consist of 29 low-lying [[atoll]]s and 5 isolated islands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rmiembassyus.org/Geography.htm|title=Geography|work=rmiembassyus.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131115173707/http://rmiembassyus.org/Geography.htm|archivedate=15 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> comprising 1,156 individual islands and [[islet]]s. The atolls and islands form two groups: the [[Ratak Chain]] and the [[Ralik Chain]] (meaning \"sunrise\" and \"sunset\" chains). All the islands in the chain are part of the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], a [[Presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]] in [[Associated state|free association]] with the United States. Having few natural resources, the islands' wealth is based on a [[service economy]], as well as some [[fishing]] and [[agriculture]]. Of the 29 atolls, 24 of them are inhabited.\n\n[[Bikini Atoll]] is an atoll in the Marshall Islands. There are 23 islands in the Bikini Atoll. The islands of Bokonijien, Aerokojlol and Nam were vaporized during nuclear tests that occurred there.<ref name=facts>{{cite web|title=Bikini Atoll Reference Facts|url=http://www.bikiniatoll.com/facts.html|accessdate=12 August 2013}}</ref> The islands are composed of low coral limestone and sand.<ref name=triposo>{{cite web|url=http://www.triposo.com/loc/Marshall_Islands|title=Marshall Islands|work=triposo.com}}</ref> The average elevation is only about {{convert|7|ft|order=flip}} above low tide level.\n\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"175px\" heights=\"175px\">\nFile:Castle Bravo Blast.jpg|Image of the [[Castle Bravo]] nuclear test, detonated on March 1, 1954, at [[Bikini Atoll]]\nFile:Cross spikes club.jpg|An illustration of the Cross Spikes Club<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/ac/bikini/bikini1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000521071018/http://history.navy.mil/ac/bikini/bikini1.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 May 2000 |title=Operation Crossroads: Bikini Atoll |work=Navy Historical Center |publisher=Department of the Navy |accessdate=4 December 2013 |df= }}</ref> of the US Navy on [[Bikini Atoll]], one of several Marshall Islands used for [[Bikini atomic experiments|atomic bomb tests]].\nFile:Kili Island - NASA Astronaut Photography.png|[[Kili Island]] is one of the smallest islands in the [[Marshall Islands]].\n</gallery>\n\n===Nauru===\n[[Nauru]] is an oval-shaped [[island country]] in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, {{convert|42|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} south of the [[Equator]], listed as the [[List of countries by area|world's smallest republic]], covering just {{convert|21|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=CIA>{{cite web|author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]] |title=Nauru |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html |year=2011 |accessdate=12 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917160201/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html |archivedate=17 September 2008 |df= }}</ref> With {{UN_Population|Nauru}} residents, it is the second [[List of countries by population|least-populated country]], after [[Vatican City]].

Coral atolls begin as [[coral reefs]] that grow on the slopes of a central [[volcano]]. When the volcano sinks back down into the sea, the coral continues to grow, keeping the reef at or above water level. One exception is [[Pohnpei State|Pohnpei]] in the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], which still has the central volcano and coral reefs around it.\n\n===Fauna===\n{{main article|List of mammals of Micronesia|List of birds of Micronesia}}\n[[File:SpinnerDolphinsoffKauai 1999-03-15.jpg|thumb|[[Spinner Dolphin]]s]]\n{{Expand section|date=December 2013}}\n\n===Climate===\nThe region has a [[tropical marine climate]] moderated by seasonal northeast [[trade winds]]. There is little seasonal temperature variation. The dry season runs from December or January to June and the rainy season from July to November or December. Because of the location of some islands, the rainy season can sometimes include [[typhoon]]s.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|History of the Federated States of Micronesia}}\n===Prehistory{{anchor|Pre-history}}===\n[[File:Chronological dispersal of Austronesian people across the Pacific (per Bellwood in Chambers, 2008).png|thumb|Chronological dispersal of [[Austronesian peoples]] across the [[Indo-Pacific]]<ref name=\"Chambers2013\">{{cite journal |last1=Chambers |first1=Geoff |title=Genetics and the Origins of the Polynesians |publisher= John Wiley & Sons, Inc.|date=2013 |doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0020808.pub2}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Suicide Cliff in Saipan 3.JPG|thumb|Mount Marpi in [[Saipan]].]]\nMicronesia began to be settled several millennia ago, although there are competing theories about the origin and arrival of the first settlers.{{sfn|Kirch|2001|p=167}} There are numerous difficulties with conducting archaeological excavations in the islands, due to their size, settlement patterns and storm damage.

Documents relating to the 1525 voyage of [[Diogo da Rocha]] suggest that he made the first European contact with inhabitants of the Caroline Islands, possibly staying on the [[Ulithi]] atoll for four months and encountering [[Yap]].

Soon after, the Hawaiian Missionary Society was founded and sent missionaries into Micronesia. Conversion was not met with as much opposition, as the local religions were less developed (at least according to Western ethnographic accounts). In contrast, it took until the end of the 19th/beginning of the 20th centuries for missionaries to fully convert the inhabitants of Melanesia; however, before a cultural contrast can even be made, one cannot neglect to take into account the fact that Melanesia has always had deadly strains of more [[malaria]] present in various degrees and distributions throughout its history {see: [[De Rays Expedition]]} and up to the present; in contrast, Micronesia does not and never seems to have had any malarial mosquitos nor pathogens on any of its islands in the past.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ridgell|first=Reilly|title=Pacific Nations and Territories: The Islands of Micronesia, Melanesia, and Polonesia|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p3liL6fAjrcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22micronesia%22#v=onepage&q=%22micronesia%22&f=false|isbn=9781573060011|year=1995}}</ref>\n\n===German\u2013Spanish Treaty of 1899===\n{{main article|German\u2013Spanish Treaty (1899)}}\n[[File:German new guinea 1888 1899.png|thumb|[[German New Guinea]] before and after the German-Spanish treaty of 1899]]\nIn the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Spain lost many of its remaining colonies. In the Pacific, the United States took possession of the [[Spanish Philippines]] and Guam. On January 17, 1899, the United States also took possession of unclaimed and uninhabited Wake Island. This left Spain with the remainder of the Spanish East Indies, about 6,000 tiny islands that were sparsely populated and not very productive. These islands were ungovernable after the loss of the administrative center of Manila and indefensible after the loss of two Spanish fleets in the war. The Spanish government therefore decided to sell the remaining islands to a new colonial power: the [[German Empire]].\n\nThe treaty, which was signed by Spanish Prime Minister [[Francisco Silvela]] on February 12, 1899, transferred the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, Palau and other possessions to Germany. Under German control, the islands became a protectorate and were administered from [[German New Guinea]]. Nauru had already been annexed and claimed as a colony by Germany in 1888.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:MapofTTPI.gif|thumb|Map from 1961 of the US [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], formerly Japan's [[South Pacific Mandate]].]]\nIn the early 20th century, the islands of Micronesia were divided between three foreign powers:\n* the [[United States]], which took control of Guam following the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898 and claimed [[Wake Island]];\n* [[German Empire|Germany]], which took Nauru and bought the Marshall, Caroline and Northern Mariana Islands from Spain; and\n* the [[British Empire]], which took the [[Gilbert Islands]] (Kiribati).\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Germany's Pacific island territories were seized and became [[League of Nations mandate]]s in 1923. Nauru became an [[Australia]]n mandate, while Germany's other territories in Micronesia were given as a mandate to [[Japan]] and were named the [[South Pacific Mandate]]. During [[World War&nbsp;II]], Nauru was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] troops and was bypassed by the Allied advance across the Pacific. Following Japan's defeat in [[World War II]] its mandate became a [[United Nations Trusteeship]] administered by the United States as the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]]. Nauru became independent in 1968.\n\n===21st century===\nToday, most of Micronesia are independent states, except for Guam and Wake Island, which are U.S. territories and for the [[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|U.S. Commonwealth of the]] [[Northern Mariana Islands]].\n\n==Politics==\nThe [[Secretariat of the Pacific Community]] is a regional intergovernmental organisation whose membership includes both nations and territories in the Pacific Ocean and their metropolitan powers.\n\n===States and dependencies===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

A few Japanese [[Longline fishing|long liners]] still ply the waters. The crews aboard fishing fleets contribute little to the local economy since their ships typically set sail loaded with stores and provisions that are cheaper than local goods. Additional money comes in from government grants, mostly from the United States and the $150 million the US paid into a trust fund for reparations of residents of Bikini Atoll that had to move after nuclear testing. Few mineral deposits worth exploiting exist, except for some high-grade phosphate, [[Phosphate mining in Nauru|especially on Nauru]].\n\nMost residents of Micronesia can freely move to and work within, the United States. Relatives working in the US that send money home to relatives represent the primary source of individual income. Additional individual income comes mainly from government jobs and work within shops and restaurants.\n\nThe [[tourist industry]] consists mainly of scuba divers that come to see the coral reefs, do wall dives and visit sunken ships from WWII. Major stops for scuba divers in approximate order are Palau, Chuuk, Yap and Pohnpei. Some private yacht owners visit the area for months or years at a time. However, they tend to stay mainly at ports of entry and are too few in number to be counted as a major source of income.\n\nCopra production used to be a more significant source of income, however, world prices have dropped in part to large palm plantations that are now planted in places like [[Borneo]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{further information|Demographics of Oceania}}\nThe people today form many ethnicities, but are all descended from and belong to the Micronesian culture. The Micronesian culture was one of the last native cultures of the region to develop. It developed from a mixture of [[Melanesians]] and [[Filipino people|Filipinos]].\nBecause of this mixture of descent, many of the ethnicities of Micronesia feel closer to some groups in [[Melanesia]], or the [[Philippines]]. A good example of this are the [[Yapese people]] who are related to [[Austronesian]] tribes in the Northern [[Philippines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/wc/Mauritania-to-Nigeria/Micronesians.html|title=Micronesians - Introduction, Location, Language, Folklore, Religion, Major holidays, Rites of passage|work=everyculture.com}}</ref> A 2011 survey found that 93.1% of Micronesian are [[Christians]].<ref name=\"Christianity in Oceania\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20130815184022/http://wwwgordonconwell.com/netcommunity/CSGCResources/ChristianityinitsGlobalContext.pdf Christianity in its Global Context, 1970\u20132020 Society, Religion, and Mission], Center for the Study of Global Christianity</ref>\n\nThere are also substantial Asian communities found across the region, most notably in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] where they form the majority and smaller communities of Europeans who have migrated from the [[United States]] or are descendants of settlers during European colonial rule in Micronesia.\n\nThough they are all geographically part of the same region, they all have very different colonial histories. The US-administered areas of Micronesia have a unique experience that sets them apart from the rest of the Pacific. Micronesia has great economic dependency on its former or current motherlands, something only comparable to the French Pacific. Sometimes, the term ''American Micronesia'' is used to acknowledge the difference in cultural heritage.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kiste, Robert C. |author2=Marshall, Mac |title=American Anthropology in Micronesia: An Assessment|year=1999|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V8Dr4fJxlkIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22micronesia%22#v=onepage&q=%22micronesia%22&f=false|isbn=9780824820176}}</ref>\n\n===Indigenous groups===\n====Carolinian people====\n\nIt is thought that ancestors of the [[Carolinian people]] may have originally immigrated from the [[Asia]]n mainland and [[Indonesia]] to Micronesia around 2,000 years ago. Their primary language is [[Carolinian language|Carolinian]], called ''Refaluwasch'' by native speakers, which has a total of about 5,700 speakers. The Carolinians have a [[matriarchy|matriarchal]] society in which respect is a very important factor in their daily lives, especially toward the [[matriarch]]s. Most Carolinians are of the [[Roman Catholic]] faith.\n\nThe immigration of Carolinians to [[Saipan]] began in the early 19th century, after the [[Spain|Spanish]] reduced the local population of [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] natives to just 3,700. They began to [[immigrate]] mostly sailing from small [[canoes]] from other islands, which a [[typhoon]] previously devastated. The Carolinians have a much darker complexion than the native [[Chamorro people|Chamorros]].\n\n====Chamorro people====\n\n[[File:Chamorro people in 1915.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chamorro people in 1915]]\nThe [[Chamorro people]] are the [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Mariana Islands]], which are politically divided between the [[Territories of the United States|United States territory]] of [[Guam]] and the [[United States]] [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]] in Micronesia. The Chamorro are commonly believed to have come from [[Southeast Asia]] at around 2000 [[Common Era|BC]]. They are most closely related to other [[Austronesian]] natives to the west in the [[Philippines]] and [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwan]], as well as the [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]] to the south.\n\nThe [[Chamorro language]] is included in the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian subgroup]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family. Because Guam was colonized by Spain for over 300 years, many words derive from the [[Spanish language]]. The traditional Chamorro number system was replaced by Spanish numbers.<ref>Rafael Rodr\u00edguez-Ponga. ''Del espa\u00f1ol al chamorro: Lenguas en contacto en el Pac\u00edfico''. Madrid, 2009, Ediciones Gondo, www.edicionesgondo.com</ref>\n\n====Chuukese people====\n\nThe [[Chuukese people]] are an [[ethnic group]] in [[Oceania]]. They constitute 48% of the population of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]]. Their language is [[Chuukese language|Chuukese]]. The home atoll of Chuuk is also known by the former name Truk.\n\n====Kaping people====\n\nThe roughly 3000 residents of the Federated States of Micronesia that reside in [[Kapingamarangi]], nicknamed 'Kapings', are both one of the most remote and most difficult people to visit in Micronesia and the entire world. Their home atoll is almost a {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} round trip to the nearest point of immigration check-in and check-out. There are no regular flights. The only way to legally visit is to first check-in, travel on a high-speed sailboat to the atoll and then backtrack almost {{convert|500|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Owing to this difficulty, only a handful of the few sailors that travel across the Pacific will attempt to visit. The local language is the [[Kapingamarangi language]]. The children typically attend high school on Pohnpei where they stay with relatives in an enclave that is almost exclusively made up of Kapings.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\n====Nauruan people====\n\nThe [[Nauruan people]] are an [[ethnicity]] inhabiting the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] [[island]] of [[Nauru]]. They are most likely a blend of [[Indigenous peoples of Oceania|other Pacific peoples]].<ref>{{cite book|title=FutureFish 2001: FutureFish in Century 21: The North Pacific Fisheries Tackle Asian Markets, the Can-Am Salmon Treaty, and Micronesian Seas|author=C.D. Bay-Hansen|year=2006|publisher=[[Trafford Publishing]]|isbn=1-55369-293-4|page=277}}</ref>\n\nThe origin of the Nauruan people has not yet been finally determined. It can possibly be explained by the last Malayo-Pacific [[human migration]] (c. 1200). It was probably seafaring or shipwrecked [[Polynesians]] or [[Melanesian]]s, which established themselves there because there was not already an [[indigenous people]] present, whereas the Micronesians were already crossed with the Melanesians in this area.\n\n===Immigrant groups===\n====Asian people====\n{{See also|Japanese settlement in Palau|Japanese settlement in the Federated States of Micronesia|Koreans in Micronesia|Chinese in Palau|Filipinos in Palau|}}\nThere are large [[Asian people|Asian]] communities found across certain Micronesian countries that are either immigrants, foreign workers or descendants of either one, most migrated to the islands during the 1800s and 1900s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iDg9oAkwsXAC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Asia in the Pacific Islands: Replacing the West|first=R.

[[Kessai Note]], the former president of the [[Marshall Islands]] has partial Japanese ancestry by way of his paternal grandfather.\n\n====European people====\n[[File:Languages of Micronesia.en.svg|thumb|250px|Languages of Micronesia.]]\n\nThe 2010 census results of Guam showed 7.1% were white while the 2005 census for Palau showed 8% were European. Smaller numbers at 1.9% in Palau and 1.8% in the Northern Mariana Islands were recorded as \"white\". In conjunction to the European communities there are large amounts of mixed Micronesians, some of which have European ancestry.\n\n===Languages===\nThe largest group of languages spoken in Micronesia are the [[Micronesian languages]]. They are in the family of [[Oceanic languages]], part of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] group. They are descended from the [[protolanguage]] [[Proto-Oceanic language|Proto-Oceanic]], which are developed from [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]].\n\nThe languages in the Micronesian family are [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]], [[Gilbertese language|Gilbertese]], [[Kosraean language|Kosraean]], [[Nauruan language|Nauruan]], as well as a large sub-family called the [[Trukic\u2013Ponapeic languages]] containing 11 languages.\n\nOn the eastern edge of the Federated States of Micronesia, the languages [[Nukuoro language|Nukuoro]] and [[Kapingamarangi language|Kapingamarangi]] represent an extreme westward extension of [[Polynesian languages|Polynesian]].\n\nThere are two languages spoken that do not belong to the [[Oceanic languages]]: [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] in the [[Mariana Islands]] and [[Palauan language|Palauan]] in [[Palau]].\n\n==Culture==\n===Animals and food===\nBy the time Western contact occurred, although Palau did not have dogs, they did have fowls and maybe also pigs. Nowhere else in Micronesia were pigs known about at that time. Fruit bats are native to Palau, but other mammals are rare. Reptiles are numerous and both mollusks and fish are an important food source.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=William N.|title=Prehistoric Architecture in Micronesia|pages=3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B3Z-aH7govUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22micronesia%22#v=onepage&q=%22micronesia%22&f=false|isbn=9780292786219|year=1988}}</ref> The people of Palau, the Marianas and Yap often chew [[Areca nut|betel nuts]] seasoned with lime and pepper leaf.

Among the most prominent works of the region is the megalithic floating city of [[Nan Madol]]. The city began in 1200 CE and was still being built when European explorers begin to arrive around 1600. The city, however, had declined by around 1800 along with the [[Saudeleur dynasty]] and was completely abandoned by the 1820s. During the 19th century, the region was divided between the [[colonialism|colonial powers]], but art continued to thrive. Wood-carving, particularly by men, flourished in the region, resulted in richly decorated ceremonial houses in [[Belau]], stylized bowls, canoe ornaments, ceremonial vessels and sometimes sculptured figures. Women created textiles and ornaments such as bracelets and headbands. Stylistically, traditional Micronesian art is streamlined and of a practical simplicity to its function, but is typically finished to a high standard of quality.\n<ref>{{cite web|title=Micronesia, 1800\u20131900 a.d|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah//ht/10/oci/ht10oci.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201183658/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah//ht/10/oci/ht10oci.htm|archivedate=1 December 2008 |year=2000}}</ref> This was mostly to make the best possible use of what few natural materials they had available to them.<ref>\"Oceanic art\", The [[Columbia Encyclopedia]], Sixth Edition 2006.</ref>\n\nThe first half of the 20th century saw a downturn in Micronesia's cultural integrity and a strong foreign influence from both western and Japanese Imperialist powers. A number of historical artistic traditions, especially sculpture, ceased to be practiced, although other art forms continued, including traditional architecture and weaving. Independence from colonial powers in the second half of the century resulted in a renewed interest in, and respect for, traditional arts.

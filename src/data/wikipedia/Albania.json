In the late thirteenth century, [[Charles of Anjou]] conquered Albanian territories from the Byzantines and established the medieval [[Kingdom of Albania (medieval)|Kingdom of Albania]], which at its maximal extension was extending from Durr\u00ebs along the coast to [[Butrint]] in the south.

Major cities in Albania have evolved from within the castle to include dwellings, religious and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques. Nowadays, the cities and towns reflect a whole spectrum of various [[architectural style]]s. In the 20th century, many historical as well as [[Sacred architecture|sacred]] buildings bearing the ancient influence were demolished during the [[Communism in Albania|communist era]].<ref>{{cite web|author1=Karin Myhrberg - [[University of Gothenburg]]|title=Heritage from the Communist Period in Albania - An Unwanted Heritage Today?|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/29221/1/gupea_2077_29221_1.pdf|website=gupea.ub.gu.se|page=12}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient architecture]] is found throughout Albania and most visible in [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Rozafa Castle|Shkod\u00ebr]] and [[Durr\u00ebs Amphitheatre|Durr\u00ebs]].

Perhaps the best known examples can be found in the southern Albanian cities and surroundings of [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]], [[Berat]], [[Voskopoj\u00eb]] and [[Gjirokast\u00ebr]].

It is also present in Shkod\u00ebr, [[Vlor\u00eb]], [[Sarand\u00eb]] and [[Durr\u00ebs]]. Moreover, other towns received their present-day Albania-unique appearance through various cultural or economic influences.\n\n[[Socialist classicism]] arrived during the [[Peoples Republic of Albania|communist era]] in Albania after the [[Second World War]]. At this period many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and numerous of historic and important buildings demolished. Notable examples of that style include the [[Mother Teresa Square (Tirana)|Mother Teresa Square]], [[Pyramid of Tirana]], [[Palace of Congresses]] and so on.\n\nTwo Albanian archaeological sites are included in the list of [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s.

Once the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s ruled over Albania for nearly five centuries, which greatly affected the country's artwork and artistic forms. After Albania's joining with the Ottoman Empire in 1478, Ottoman influenced art forms such as [[mosaic]] and [[mural]] paintings became prevalent and no real artistic change occurred until the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|independence]] in 1912.\n\nFollowing mosaics and murals from [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] and the [[Middle Ages]], the first paintings were [[icon]]s Byzantine traditions. Albanian earliest icons date from the late 13th century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the 18th century. Among the most prominent representatives of the Albanian iconographic art were [[Onufri]] and [[David Selenica]]. The museums of [[Berat]], [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]] and [[Tirana]] houses good collections remaining icons.\n\nBy the end of the Ottoman rule, the painting was limited mostly to [[folk art]] and ornate mosques.<ref name=\"www.albanianart.net index_al\">{{Cite web|title = Robert Elsie: Arti Shqiptar|url = http://www.albanianart.net/index_al.html|website = www.albanianart.net|accessdate = 22 November 2015}}</ref> Paintings and sculpture arose in the first half of the twentieth century and reached a modest peak in the 1930s and 1940s, when the first organized art exhibitions at national level.<ref name=\"www.albanianart.net index_al\"/> Contemporary Albanian artwork captures the struggle of everyday Albanians, however new artists are utilizing different artistic styles to convey this message.

(Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see [[Thraco-Illyrian]].)\n\nThe cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the [[Albanian language]] in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the northern of Albania, but also of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] in the south. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language, what [[Martin Luther]] did for the [[German language]]. [[Meshari]] (''The Missal'') written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] was published in 1555 and is considered as one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.\nThe earliest evidence dates from 1332&nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pag\u00ebzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Pal Engj\u00eblli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.\n\n{{multiple image\n|align       = left\n|total_width = 230\n\n|image1   = NaumVeqilharxhi.jpg\n|caption1 = [[Naum Veqilharxhi]] lawyer and scholar <small>(1797\u20131854)</small>\n\n|image2   = Parashqevi-qirjazi_152_186.jpg\n|caption2 = [[Parashqevi Qiriazi]] teacher and feminist <small>(1880\u20131970)</small>\n}}\n\nAlbanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too. They are mentioned by the humanist [[Marin Barleti]], who in his book [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)#The Book|Siege of Shkod\u00ebr]] (''Rrethimi i Shkodr\u00ebs'') from 1504, confirms that he leafed through such chronicles written in the language of the people (''in vernacula lingua'') as well as his famous biography of [[Skanderbeg]] [[Marin Barleti|Historia de vita et gestis Scanderbegi Epirotarum principis]] (''History of Skanderbeg'') from 1508. The ''History of Skanderbeg'' is still the foundation of Skanderbeg studies and is considered an Albanian cultural treasure, vital to the formation of Albanian national self-consciousness.\n\nDuring the 16th and the 17th centuries, the [[catechism]] (''E mb\u00ebsuame krishter\u00eb'') (Christian Teachings) from 1592 written by [[Lek\u00eb Matr\u00ebnga]], (''Doktrina e krishter\u00eb'') (The Christian Doctrine) from 1618 and (''Rituale romanum'') 1621 by [[Pjet\u00ebr Budi]], the first writer of original Albanian [[prose]] and poetry, an [[Remorse|apology]] for George Castriot (1636) by [[Frang Bardhi]], who also published a dictionary and [[folklore]] creations, the theological-philosophical treaty ''[[Cuneus Prophetarum]]'' (The Band of Prophets) (1685) by [[Pjet\u00ebr Bogdani]], the most universal personality of Albanian [[Middle Ages]], were published in [[Albanian language|Albanian]]. The most famous Albanian writer in the 20th and 21st century is probably [[Ismail Kadare]]. He has been mentioned as a possible recipient of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature several times.\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Cinema of Albania}}\n\n[[File:Eliza Dushku (3756552915).jpg|thumb|right|[[Albanian Americans|Albanian-American]] actress [[Eliza Dushku]] produced the documentary [[Dear Albania]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-dushku/albania-travel-_b_946341.html |title=Why You Must Visit Albania |publisher=The Huffington Post|date=September 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 11, 2012 |first=Eliza |last=Dushku}}</ref> with a crew from [[Travel Channel]] and [[Lonely Planet]], promoting tourism in Albania.]]\n\n[[Cinema of Albania|Cinematography]] became popular in the 20th century, when foreign films and documentaries were shown in the cities of [[Shkod\u00ebr]] and [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aqshf.gov.al/|title=AQSHF|website=www.aqshf.gov.al}}</ref> The first public showing to occur in Albania was a little-known title, Paddy the Reliable a comical story.\n\nThe first Albanian films were mostly [[documentaries]]; the first was about the [[Monastir Congress]] that sanctioned the [[Albanian alphabet]] in 1908. During communism, the Albanian Film Institute that later became known as [[Kinostudio Shqip\u00ebria e Re]] was founded with Soviet assistance, focusing mostly on propaganda of wartime struggles. After 1945, the [[communist state|communist government]] founded the [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|Kinostudio Shqip\u00ebria e Re]] in 1952. This was followed by the first Albanian [[epic film]], the [[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg|Great Warrior Skanderbeg]], a cooperation with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists chronicling the life and fight of the Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]]. In addition the film was awarded the International Prize at the [[1954 Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nBy 1990, about 200 movies had been produced, and Albania had over 450 theaters. With the economic transition after the collapse of communism in the 1990s, the Kinostudio was broken up and privatised. A new [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|National Center of Cinematography]] was established, while cities built modern cinema theatres showing mostly American movies. The [[Tirana International Film Festival]] was established in 2003 and has become the premier and largest film festival in the country as well as in the Balkans. [[Durr\u00ebs]] hosts the [[International Film Summerfest of Durr\u00ebs]], the second largest international film festival in the country which takes place every year in late August or early September in [[Durr\u00ebs Amphitheatre]].\n\nNotable [[List of Albanian film directors|Albanian film directors]] include [[Andamion Murataj]], [[Besim Sahat\u00e7iu]], [[Xhanfize Keko]], [[Dhimit\u00ebr Anagnosti]], [[Kujtim \u00c7ashku]], [[Luljeta Hoxha]], [[Saim Kokona]], [[Saimir Kumbaro]], [[Kristaq Mitro]], [[Leon Qafzezi]] and [[Gjergj Xhuvani]].

The country made their Winter Olympic Games debut in [[Winter Olympics 2006|2006]]. Albania missed the next four games, two of them due to the 1980 and 1984 boycotts, but returned for the 1992 games in [[1992 Olympic Winter Games|Barcelona]]. Since then, Albania have participated in all games. Albania normally competes in events that include swimming, athletics, weightlifting, shooting and wrestling. The country have been represented by the [[National Olympic Committee of Albania]] since 1972. The nation has participated at the [[Mediterranean Games]] since the games of [[1987 Mediterranean Games|1987]] in Syria.

Football is by far the most popular sport in Albania. It is governed by the [[Football Association of Albania]] ({{lang-sq|Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit}}, F.SH.F.), which was created in 1930 and has membership in [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]]. Football arrived in Albania early in the 20th century when the inhabitants of the northern city of [[Shkod\u00ebr]] were surprised to see a strange game being played by students at a Christian mission.\n\nThe [[Albania national football team]], ranking 51st in the [[FIFA World Rankings|World]] in 2017 (highest 22nd on 22 August 2015) have won the [[1946 Balkan Cup]] and the [[Rothmans International Tournament 2000|Malta Rothmans International Tournament 2000]], but had never participated in any major [[UEFA]] or [[FIFA]] tournament, until [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Albania's first ever appearance at the continental tournament and at a major men's football tournament. Albania scored their first ever goal in a major tournament and secured their first ever win in European Championship when they beat [[Romania national football team|Romania]] by 1\u20130 in a [[UEFA Euro 2016]] match on 19 June 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/06/19/albania-vs-romania-euro-2016---live/|title=Euro 2016: Albania 0\u20131 Romania \u2013 Armando Sadiku scores the only goal to seal his country's first ever win at a major competition|work=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/romania-0-1-albania-armando-8233364|title=Romania 0\u20131 Albania \u2013 Sadiku scores landmark goal to provide last 16 hope|date=19 June 2016|work=mirror.co.uk|accessdate=19 June 2016}}</ref> The most successful football clubs in the country are [[KF Sk\u00ebnderbeu Kor\u00e7\u00eb|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]], [[KF Tirana]], [[FK Dinamo Tirana|Dinamo Tirana]], [[FK Partizani Tirana|Partizani]] and [[KF Vllaznia Shkod\u00ebr|Vllaznia]].\n\nWeightlifting is one of the most successful individual sport for the Albanians, with the national team winning medals at the [[European Weightlifting Championships]] and the rest international competitions. Albanian weightlifters have won a total of 16 medals at the [[European Weightlifting Championships|European Championships]] with 1 of them being gold, 7 silver and 8 bronze.

The [[Albanian diaspora]] has been formed since the late [[Middle Ages]], when they emigrated to places such as [[Italy]], especially in [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]], and [[Greece]] to escape either various socio-political difficulties or the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]] of Albania.<ref>{{cite book|title=Historia e popullit shqiptar|author=Stafi i Akedemise se Shkencave|year=2003|publisher=Botimet Toena|p=252\u2013254}}</ref> Following the [[Fall of communism in Albania|fall of communism]], large numbers of Albanians have migrated to countries such as [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Albanian [[Minority group|minorities]] are present in the neighboring territories such as the west of [[North Macedonia]], the east of [[Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] in its entirety and southern [[Serbia]]. In [[Kosovo]], Albanians make up the largest ethnic group in the country. Altogether, the number of ethnic Albanian living abroad its territory is estimated to be higher than the total population inside the territory of Albania.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Albania|Mediterranean}}\n* [[Outline of Albania]]\n* [[Index of Albania-related articles]]\n* [[Bibliography of Albania]]\n* {{books-inline|Albania}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = status\n| {{Kosovo-note}}\n}}\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}} \n* ''History of the Party of Labor of Albania''.

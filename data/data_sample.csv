"&gt;Did you hike all the way to Simatai?

I did that hike a while back. Almost died when a step collapsed out from under me and I went head over heels down stone steps.

Totally worth it. "
Money. And you’re vegan? Good luck with that. You’re cheating yourself out of great cuisine. 
Do note: raids are not uncommon and the law still applies in there. It's just super laid-back.
I’m not familiar with this form of measurement. How many bananas in a cow?
"I’m from the US

And it’s 90 cumulative days per 180, but since I’ve spent 12 out of the area already, it would have been 86 days- not yet overstaying the 90."
Oh yeah and if you already know it's the food capital of the world!
"It's a gamble really.  


Insurance is only \~$100 because chances are you wont hurt yourself.  


But IF you do, and it happens to tourists all the time, you will be liable for all medical bills which WILL be 1000s of $."

That's crazy. I much prefer our custom here where you are left alone and flag down a server if you need something which is considered normal and polite.

"Thank you! I think we are completely missing France now, going from Hull to Rotterdam. Maybe. And just going backwards from there, through to Poland, through Germany, and up to somewhere with a port where we can get home... not thought it through properly yet!"
Flying into Monterey and probably renting a car. I know it's a large area but I do want something on the coast.
"There are some overland truck trips that go there, one of their trucks was at the camp we were at.  Or there is a shuttle bus that goes Windhoek or Swakopmund to Sossusvlei a few times a week.  It's very easy to drive in Namibia, though most roads are gravel."
"The TSA does, thats why this person is asking. "
I have a flight for her and I on the same airline a few weeks later that’s returning back to where she had flown out from already been purchased. I don’t intend to do anything about the cancelled ticket. Does that apply? Sorry if I’m being a little paranoid. This doesn’t seem to be a big deal.
"damn, you're the man"
"I have a MI Note. It's dual SIM with one SD slot. I bought it in Barcelona for $150. Spent another $75 on a glass screen protector and case.

What phone do you use now? I used a BLU Jenny for a long time. Still have it. If you non-smartphone is unlocked take it with you."
Thanks! I hope they can also provide text-only format :)
What about traveling alone? I want to go but I will have to trek it all by myself.
Lots of travel insurance companies out there. We used Seven Corners.
Did you wipe?
Yea! Both thr allies and the axis committed crimes! No right side!
No nonsense replies please.
"You're not going to see a lot of museums and historical cities outside of big centers. This is a tiny island. I'm guessing you're the type of tourist that prefers big cities? If so then you should stick to Edinburgh.

What you get at Isle of Skyes are unique views that photos don't do justice to and that are difficult to get anywhere else in the world."
[I biked it.](https://i.imgur.com/Vsr4GpA.jpg) Lots of bottles.
It's the ultimate FEBO classic! 
Just googled what you offered and both options look amazing! Can they be done as day trips from London and accessible with public transportation?
I was just there a couple weeks ago! Check out angels landing if you want another amazing view

Do you have any recommendation for Comuna 13 tours? There are many companies out there"

There’s not much in the way of “interesting towns” between Santa Fe and Phoenix. You may have more interesting things happening with the weather on that drive since it should be Winter and snow is always a possibility. 

Flagstaff could be interesting but that is only 2 and a half hours from Phoenix.

"It weird the responses you are getting and some of them are quite mean. I've been to over 50 countries and never once purchased it or had any issues.  I think some of the replies are from novice travellers that would be scared to travel without or heard of that one time in a million that someone needed it.  Many credit cards cover lost baggage and car rentals so you don't need travel insurance for that.  But travel should be fun and if buying insurance gives you piece of mind,get it. 

That being said, I'm also going to Bali this year and I'm adding trio insurance for the first time ever.  The Gili's got hit pretty hard with a earthquake in August and there were tourist that incurred extra travel costs to evacuate.  I went to Bali last time and had a wonderful time and I'm actually going to the Gili's this time.  The people in the area need the tourist money to return so they can recover so I'm going as long as my hotel is standing.  "
"Thank you for your input. It’s very concerning that all three advise against travel. Unfortunately I have not seen nor spoken to my family there since I was pretty much an infant. I’m honestly not sure if most of them know I exist. My mom’s sister (who will be joining us) lives in the states as well, and neither her nor my mom seem to be concerned about going. And I’m not sure if it’s because they’re not worried or just don’t know what’s going on considering how long it’s been since they’ve been in their hometown. I’ll definitely be reaching out to more family sources!

"Did you try using Rome2Rio?

If you don't give us your budget it's hard to recommend anything. 

And saying ""Japan"" is meaningless. Getting from Tokyo to Seoul will be much different than Hiroshima to Seoul."
"Fantastico Sur's website is MUCH better than Vertice.  I was actually able to see accurate availability for FS, but Vertice continually returned nothing for Glacier Grey Campsite.  I finally gave up and sent an email asking about availability.  It took 9 days to hear back, but they confirmed availability for our dates.  The whole booking set up is frustrating, but should be worth it!

Also, if you're doing the W or O trek, be sure to make all of your reservations in advance and print out your confirmations.  I've read that they will be checking for confirmations of lodging and turning people around on the trails, if you can't show proof of an advance booking.

When will you be there?  We are also going in early November for the W trek."

"In solo travel you get to choose what to do and when, obviously. If you're relatively fit you can see and do a lot more than otherwise. You can spend big on activities/events and cheap-out on accomodation, or vice versa, without a group decision. You're more likely to get into events and find great seats since you just need the one ticket.  
  
Travelling with others you like spending time with obviously makes for a more social experience - chatting over meals, joking around while waiting in queues, etc. You're more likely to have memorable leisurely meals and relax in bars or cafes. You have support when things go wrong and can benefit from teamwork, people often have different talents that come in handy. You can divide the research and organisation workload, like how to get from A to B."
"Loved this hike! We were scared to do Angels Landing, but this was an almost better alternative "

I took an art history class at community college and this was featured in the architecture section of our textbook! I remember the pictures and thinking it looked so rad. He also did a lot of houses in AZ (where I live and I think where he was from though I could be wrong on that). 
"I actually just picked up a Surface Go to serve as my travel computer. It's a little sluggish compared to my MacBook Pro but it's also a fraction the weight. Camera, meanwhile, I'd normally take one lens and leave the rest behind.

Good point about /r/digitalnomad. I tend to think of them as being situated in places for longer stints, but they'll have some good insights I'm sure."
"Going on a roadtrip across France, Switzerland and Germany later this year. Had no idea about that. Who exactly do you pay for it? Is there a toll booth, or can you pay at the rental place? Anything else I should know about Switzerland in general? Only spending a few nights there, although from the sounds of the cost I'll be eating fast food. "
"I try to do it during travels but it always gets messed up. I have a rough idea during the trip, then get a semi-precise number when I get home. But otherwise, I'd say either a Google Keep type document to update with each expense, or write them all down during the day and record to a 'master ledger' at the end of the day. "
Looks wonderful
"The only good part of the city, my university is inside the calanque and i can say that's wonderful ! I can even go to the beach from there xD"
Antigua St. John’s? I’ll be travelling there soon? Pretty much same reason as your wife. But going solo to totally relax. How safe is it for solo traveller? Did you get any type of bad vibes there? 
"How long? Winter? Obviously you will need to pack more. If you plan on going to the mountains you will also need to pack more. 

I would avoid buying anything you are not 100% certain you will use, for things you are uncertain about and do not already have, just buy them theer if you really need it. No idea where you are from, but NZ is not the cheapest place for buying some stuff though, so consider this.  
 
Hiking can be very varied on what you need... maybe you need crampons or snow shoes for hiking in the winter, maybe you need multi layer heavy duty coats... or maybe you just need some synthetic shorts and hiking shoes... it depends on your preferences and what you will be doing. So figure out what you know you will be doing, what you want to be doing, and see what you already have for it... buying tons of stuff for a trip just makes trips unecessariyl expensive."
"Go Pack.  
And I assume you'll recommend finding a great Airbnb and doing the local thing over staying at a resort, yes? I've been looking them up but they're just so freaking expensive. It's unreal. "

"So January is school holidays in Australia and the Gold Coast is a popular family destination. You’ll find hotel prices are increased and lots of tourist places are busy with families.

What city are you flying into?

If wanting to stay in the South East Queensland area - there’s much nicer beaches on the Sunshine Coast, you could look at Byron Bay, Fraser Island and also the Gold Coast hinterland.

We did lots of family trips to the Gold Coast for theme parks as a child, but it’s not somewhere I’d go to spend 2 weeks as an adult.

I would be budgeting A$100/day each for food/drinks/public transport. In terms of activities - could be anything from $A50-$250+ for each activity depending on what it is.

"You're spoiled for natural beauty in the USA. What kind do you want? 

Florida had nice swamps, forests, beaches, and ocean.

The Arizona/Utah area has wonderful Canyons and deserts.

Montana has great mountains and wildlife areas.

California has Yosemite, and a bunch of other gems.

Alaska has massive mountains and is very untouched.

Hawaii has incredible mountains, canyons, beaches, ocean.. everything! 

Canada with places like Banff is also an option.

The most beautiful place I've ever been is Kauai in Hawaii. After that, Yosemite in California. Grand Canyon and Monument Valley are fighting for third! "

"I've taken both BA and Virgin - I preferred Virgin but not by leaps and bounds. I will say, checking luggage with BA at every airport I've been through has been incredibly slow. Like showed up three hours before my flight and still barely got to gate before boarding kind of slow. Virgin was painless and efficient."
"Yep, that's probably your best option."
"If you go I would recommend the Food Hallen for variety. Also, you can't visit Amsterdam without having Rijsttafel at an Indonesian restaurant. Personally, my favorite is Tempo Doloe.

"In which case, just round the corner is Rannô Ptáča, a fantastic cafe. It’s a must!

Also not far from there is Fabrika, which was attached to our hotel (Loft). Wish we had gone before the last night, because although it was expensive, it was very very good!

If you’re on a budget though, the first place is your best bet. "

"Wait, so are you stopping in any other city other than Irkutsk in Russia? Those are gonna be long train trips, be prepared with power packs, some food. Even if you have a SIM card there's signal only near the stations, so download movies, series, music or whatever kind of entertainment you enjoy.  
And Mongolia is such an awesome country, I think you should maximize your time there and explore. You can choose a tour as soon as you get down from the train, they will be offering you lots in UB.  
The train is a cool experience if you have enough time, but the only scenic part I loved was seeing Baikal as you go from Irkutsk to Ulan Ude. It's not so much worthwhile if your time is limited, you could easily fly to Irkutsk then take the train to UB for the experience.
